  "title": "Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Autoimmune Conditions: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Systemic autoimmune conditions are characterized by increased inflammation and high disease burden. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is known to activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and can serve as a potential therapeutic modality for autoimmune conditions. This study aimed to conduct a preregistered systematic review to determine the effect of VNS on inflammation in autoimmune conditions, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases of Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched until September 2, 2024. Data pertaining to changes in inflammatory blood biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients with autoimmune conditions receiving VNS were extracted. Studies were included if they provided measurements of peripheral blood biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Study screenings and full-text article reviews were conducted in duplicate. The design of the included studies was assessed using the National Health Lung and Blood Institute guidelines. Twelve clinical trials studying the effect of VNS on rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematous, and systemic sclerosis were reviewed. We found that >50% of studies found a reduction in the mean difference of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels before and after VNS (C-reactive protein decreased in 6 of 9 studies; tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 4 of 8 studies) with the most consistent reduction in IL-6 levels (6 of 7 studies). Although it can be suggested that VNS can decrease markers of pro-inflammation in autoimmune diseases, more clinical studies with robust design and quality are needed to more confidently support VNS as a therapeutic option for autoimmune conditions.",
