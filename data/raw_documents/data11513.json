  "title": "The efficacy and safety of indobufen versus aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction: a retrospective observational study.",
  "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors is the first antiplatelet of choice for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but alternatives are needed for patients at high bleeding risk or with aspirin intolerance/hypersensitivity. This observational study investigated the efficacy and safety of indobufen, a reversible COX-1 inhibitor, among AMI patients compared to those receiving aspirin. We retrospectively enrolled 907 consecutive AMI patients treated between June 2021 and June 2024. The primary endpoints were GUSTO bleeding and MACE between aspirin and indobufen. Patients receiving indobufen were older and had higher rates of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, gastritis, and peptic ulcers (all p < 0.05). Over a median follow-up of 462 days, aspirin was associated with a higher incidence of GUSTO mild bleeding (23.8% vs. 8.6%, p < 0.001), with no significant differences in moderate/severe bleeding, re-infarction, stroke, heart failure, rehospitalization, or MACE (all p > 0.05). Multivariate regression confirmed indobufen independently reduced GUSTO mild bleeding risk. Boruta and SHAP analyses identified antiplatelet therapy, particularly aspirin, as a predictor of GUSTO mild bleeding. Indobufen may be considered an alternative antiplatelet therapy for AMI patients with a high bleeding risk and/or aspirin intolerance/hypersensitivity, however, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",
