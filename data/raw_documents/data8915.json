    "abstract": "Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs (antithrombotics) predispose to acute and chronic subdural hematomas. Patients on these drugs are at higher likelihood of presenting with larger hematomas and more severe neurologic deficits. Standard neurosurgical and neurocritical care of subdural hematomas involves reversal of antithrombosis preoperatively, whereas reversing antiplatelet drugs is less clear. This article highlights the spectrum of antithrombotic agents in common use, their mechanisms of action, and strategies for reversal.",
