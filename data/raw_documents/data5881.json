    "abstract": "This review focuses on mechanosensitive enteric neurons (MEN) in the guinea pig stomach and their roles in gastric motor reflex pathways. The guinea pig model is advantageous for studying gastric physiology, as its stomach structure and function closely resemble those of humans. Gastric motility involves distinct functional regions: the fundus and proximal corpus act as reservoirs, while the distal corpus and antrum handle food mixing and propulsion. Mechanosensitivity in both gastric cholinergic and nitrergic enteric neurons plays a critical role in adapting muscle activity in response to gastric content volume. These neurons enable reflex circuits involved in the accommodation reflex, with cholinergic excitatory and nitrergic inhibitory pathways promoting relaxation. This review summarizes the anatomical, functional, and neurochemical characteristics of MEN across gastric regions, their direct and indirect interactions with smooth muscle, and the role of distinct neurotransmitters in modulating gastric motility. The need for future studies on mechanosensitive pathways and involved neuronal receptors is highlighted to enhance our understanding, finally aiding therapeutic development.",
