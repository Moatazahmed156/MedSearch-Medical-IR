    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a global disease with high morbidity and mortality, which seriously affects human health. The long-term existence of chronic pulmonary inflammation is closely related to the occurrence and development of lung cancer, neutrophils are not only involved in acute and chronic inflammation, but also in the composition of tumor microenvironment (TME), which is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors. Recent studies have found that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play an important role in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. This article reviews the role, mechanism and clinical significance of tumor-related neutrophils in lung cancer.",
