  "abstract": "We previously developed a bead-coupled ligase detection reaction (LDR) assay that enables simple and rapid detection of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) using synthetic oligonucleotide templates. In the present study, this approach was extended to genomic DNA extracted from colorectal cancer cell lines to evaluate its applicability to clinically relevant samples. Targeting codon 12 of the ",
