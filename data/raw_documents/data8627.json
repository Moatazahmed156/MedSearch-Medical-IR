    "abstract": "Wound healing, a critical biological process vital for tissue restoration, has spurred a global market exceeding $15 billion for wound care products and $12 billion for scar treatment. Chronic wounds lead to delayed or impaired wound healing. Natural bioactive compounds, prized for minimal side effects, stand out as promising candidates for effective wound healing. In response, researchers are turning to nanotechnology, employing the encapsulation of these agents into drug delivery carriers. Drug delivery system will play a crucial role in enabling targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to promote tissue regeneration and address underlying issues such as inflammation, infection, and impaired angiogenesis in chronic wound healing. Drug delivery carriers offer distinct advantages, exhibiting a substantial ratio of surface area to volume and altered physical and chemical properties. These carriers facilitate sustained and controlled release, proving particularly advantageous for the extended process of wound healing, that typically comprise a diverse range of components, integrating both natural and synthetic polymers. Additionally, they often incorporate bioactive molecules. Despite their properties, including poor solubility, rapid degradation, and limited bioavailability, various natural bioactive agents face challenges in clinical applications. With a global research, emphasis on harnessing nanomaterial for wound healing application, this research overview engages advancing drug delivery technologies to augment the effectiveness of tissue regeneration using bioactive molecules. Recent progress in drug delivery has poised to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in wound healing applications.",
