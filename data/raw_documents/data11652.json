  "abstract": "Angiogenesis is an important mechanism in stroke therapy. Circular RNA-DICAR is known to protect against diabetes-induced cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. In this study, we examined the effect of DICAR on angiogenesis as well as the therapeutic effect of DICAR-JP, which is its functional domain, against stroke. The mechanism involves the miR-361-5p/PRMT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO) method was used to establish a mouse stroke model in the DICAR-Tg mouse model. AAV9-DICAR-JP was constructed and injected into the cerebral ventricles. Furthermore, tube formation assays were used to evaluate the  Results indicated that DICAR-Tg improved neuronal function. AAV9-DICAR-JP increased blood flow in the brain following stroke. DICAR-siRNA upregulated miR-361-5p expression, and overexpression of miR-361-5p significantly reduced PRMT1 expression. DICAR/DICAR-JP has potential therapeutic benefits in stroke, which is mediated by the miR-361-5p/PRMT1 signaling pathway.",
