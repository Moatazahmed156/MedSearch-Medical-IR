    "abstract": "Cytology is an effective method for assessing benign endometrium and for discovering premalignant and malignant endometrial states. In addition, it is useful for diagnosing non-neoplastic abnormalities of the endometrium. This overview compares endometrial cytology to endometrial histology for a variety of benign, abnormal non-neoplastic, and neoplastic conditions; and, discusses both diagnostic criteria and pitfalls in the assessment of endometrial brushings specimens. It also makes an attempt to estimate levels of confidence in endometrial cytodiagnosis. When endometrial brushing is used in conjunction with other diagnostic techniques such as ultrasonography/sonohysterography or hysteroscopy, cytology becomes a sensitive case finding technique that shows good patient acceptance (because of a significant decrease in procedure-associated pain) and high diagnostic yield.",
