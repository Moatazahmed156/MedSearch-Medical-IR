  "title": "Migration of embolising material to the heart during liver venous deprivation.",
  "abstract": "This case report describes a man in the late 60s with stage IV, RAS-mutated colorectal cancer with the bilobar liver metastasis, planned for a two-stage hepatectomy. Following right hemicolectomy and an ultrasound-guided clearance of liver metastases located in the left liver, a liver venous deprivation (LVD) was planned. During the procedure, a portion of the embolisation glue migrated into the right atrium. The interventional radiology team promptly recognised and successfully retrieved the migrated glue, preventing adverse sequelae. This report describes a rare complication of LVD, which was promptly identified and managed.",
