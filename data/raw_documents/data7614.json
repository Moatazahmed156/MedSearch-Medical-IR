    "abstract": "Psychological interventions may be effective in improving adherence after bariatric surgery; however, there is limited research on patients' willingness to engage with psychological aftercare. This study aimed to qualitatively explore patient perspectives on psychological services in the bariatric setting. Participants reported believing that psychological care is essential for treatment success and indicated that they wanted support with adjusting to changes in lifestyle, self-identity, and relationships after surgery. Participants suggested that psychological aftercare should be recommended by their medical team and incorporated into standard management after bariatric surgery. These findings can be used to inform the design of services for bariatric surgery patients.",
