    "abstract": "A 66-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital for resection of a right atrial mass. Four months earlier, she had suffered an acute cerebrovascular accident due to occlusion of the sylvian segment of the right middle cerebral artery from atheromatous tight stenosis in the right internal carotid artery. Later, investigations with transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 3.4-cm right atrial mass that was resected surgically. Microscopic evaluation revealed a well-circumscribed nodular tumor, located within the interatrial septum, and corresponding to an angioleiomyoma (ALM). This tumor differs histologically from atrial myxoma. ALM is a ubiquitous benign tumor but has never been reported to occur in the atrium. ALM can mimic cardiac myxoma and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atrial tumors.",
