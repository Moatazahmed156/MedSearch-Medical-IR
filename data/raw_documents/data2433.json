    "abstract": "Doxorubicin + cisplatin and paclitaxel + carboplatin are standard chemotherapy regimens for endometrial cancer. The development of PD-1 and PDL-1 antibody drugs has led to the use of these agents for endometrial cancer in other countries. The KEYNOTE-775 trial for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer demonstrated the benefits of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy, and the results of this trial led to the approval of its coverage for recurrent cancer by the Japanese health insurance system. Currently, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is transitioning from second-line to first-line therapy. In a global randomized phase III study, the drugs dostarlimab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab, which are not yet approved in Japan, showed better results in the study arms than in the control arm. Additionally, biomarkers have been developed for endometrial cancer, enabling gynecologists to pursue treatment options based on the biomarkers detected for better treatment outcomes. In this article, we review the clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.",
