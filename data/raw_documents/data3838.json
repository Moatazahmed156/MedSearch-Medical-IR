    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical complication characterized by a sudden deterioration of the kidney's excretory function, which normally occurs secondary to another serious illness. AKI is an important risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurrence and progression to kidney failure. It is, therefore, crucial to block the development of AKI as early as possible. To date, existing animal studies have shown that senescence occurs in the early stage of AKI and is extremely critical to prognosis. Cellular senescence is an irreversible process of cell cycle arrest that is accompanied by alterations at the transcriptional, metabolic, and secretory levels along with modified cellular morphology and chromatin organization. Acute cellular senescence tends to play an active role, whereas chronic senescence plays a dominant role in the progression of AKI to CKD. The occurrence of chronic senescence is inseparable from senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and senescence-related pathways. SASP acts on normal cells to amplify the senescence signal through senescence-related pathways. Senescence can be improved by initiating reprogramming, which plays a crucial role in blocking the progression of AKI to CKD. This review integrates the existing studies on senescence in AKI from several aspects to find meaningful research directions to improve the prognosis of AKI and prevent the progression of CKD.",
