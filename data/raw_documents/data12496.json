  "abstract": "Up to 25% of stage II colorectal adenocarcinomas recur within the first five years after diagnosis. The assessment of the stromal percentage, recently incorporated into the TNM classification system, may represent a particularly relevant predictive factor for recurrence in cases with microsatellite stability. We evaluated disease-free survival (DFS) in an independent retrospective cohort, measured the stromal percentage across the entire invasive front of the tumor, and assessed the interobserver agreement of this measurement method. Among 131 cases, 16 (12.2%) showed a high stromal percentage and 115 (87.8%) a low one. A high stromal percentage was associated with high-grade budding (",
