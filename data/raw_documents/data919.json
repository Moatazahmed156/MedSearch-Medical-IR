    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. It is seen in people of all nationalities and in all areas of the world. Fragile X syndrome can be a devastating condition, as many boys are severely retarded and require multiple services. Treatment involves behaviour management techniques, appropriate school placement, community support for the family, and careful medical follow-up often including psychopharmacology. The genetics of fragile X syndrome is now understood, prenatal testing is available, and the disorder is preventable through appropriate genetic counselling. This review focuses on the neurobiology of fragile X syndrome, its clinical features and treatment.",
