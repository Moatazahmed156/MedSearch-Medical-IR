  "title": "Physiological Impact of Lipid-Rich Plaque on Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction: Evaluation Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Intravascular Ultrasound and Angiography-Derived Index of Microcirculatory Resistance After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.",
  "abstract": "Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with poor prognosis, including periprocedural myocardial infarction, and is often attributed to distal embolization of lipid-rich plaque components. However, whether preprocedural lipid quantification using near-infrared spectroscopy-intravascular ultrasonography (NIRS-IVUS) can predict CMD remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 147 coronary lesions in 121 patients with coronary artery disease (excluding ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) who underwent NIRS-IVUS-guided PCI. CMD was defined as an angiography-based index of microcirculatory resistance (angio-IMR) ≥25. Two NIRS-derived lipid parameters were assessed: maximum lipid core burden index >4 mm (maxLCBI CMD occurred in 36.7 % of lesions and was associated with significantly higher values of both indices (p < 0.01). A stepwise trend between lipid burden and microvascular dysfunction was also observed. Optimal cut-offs were identified as maxLCBI Higher pre-PCI maxLCBI",
