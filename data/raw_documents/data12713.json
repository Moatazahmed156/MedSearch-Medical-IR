  "abstract": "Anticoagulant effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are influenced by their plasma levels and anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity. Delayed bleeding is a major adverse event associated with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of colorectal neoplasms. However, the association between post-EMR bleeding and pharmacodynamics in patients taking DOAC remains unknown. This study investigated the association between pharmacological risk factors and delayed bleeding in patients receiving DOAC. This multicenter prospective trial in Japan evaluated the incidence of post-EMR delayed bleeding in DOAC users between April 2018 and May 2022 and determined the association of post-EMR delayed bleeding with plasma levels and FXa activity. The incidence of post-EMR delayed bleeding was 10.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.3%-18.0%). There were large individual differences in plasma levels and FXa activity for each DOAC.
