    "abstract": "We detected yellow fever virus by using quantitative PCR in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and isolated the virus in C6/36 cells in 4 of 18 pools, including 118 specimens collected in an urban green area in São Paulo State, Brazil. Additional monitoring to detect shifts in transmission of this species is warranted.",
