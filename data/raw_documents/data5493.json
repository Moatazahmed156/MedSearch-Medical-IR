    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently have been recognized as having a critical role in cancer development and progression. Gastric cancer remains a major clinical challenge worldwide owing to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs may play an active role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, prognosis and drug resistance of gastric cancer. Here, we collect recent knowledge to show differential expression of lncRNA in gastric cancer and their underlying mechanism of activities in gastric cancer involved in epigenetic, transcription and post-transcriptional processing. This review focuses on the regulation and function of gastric cancer-related lncRNAs and provides an overview of current effects to exploit them to be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.",
