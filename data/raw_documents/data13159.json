  "abstract": "The CenTauR (CTR) standard method for PET measurement of tau provides consistent results across tau tracers. This study establishes regional CTR thresholds for elevated tau and evaluates the CTR relationship with amyloid, neurodegeneration and cognition across the AD spectrum. 924 participants from the AIBL-ADNeT study (448 cognitively unimpaired (CU), 300 MCI, 176 clinical AD), underwent  From tau scans in A- (<25 CL) CU, 2 SD thresholds were 11 CTR in the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) and 15 CTR in the Temporo-Parietal (TP) cortex. There was a non-linear relationship between Aβ and tau with cortical tau rare below 60 CL (Figure 1). In clinical AD, 71% had A+ and neocortical tau+ (T This study has established regional CTR thresholds and the prevalence of MTL and cortical tau in CU, MCI and clinical AD. It has confirmed that cortical tau is rarely found below 60 CL of Aβ. Cortical CTR strongly correlates with cognitive impairment and atrophy, while tau restricted to the MTL is linked to mild memory impairment.",
