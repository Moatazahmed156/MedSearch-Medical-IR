    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer have multiple therapeutic options. However, most are not studied in the renal replacement therapy (RRT) setting.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report the use of Phesgo® (subcutaneous fixed-dose combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab) combined with exemestane as a first-line treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in a hemodialysis patient with multiple comorbidities. Partial response was attained, with disease progression after 8 months without evidence of significant toxicity.\n    \n\n\n          Discussions:\n        \n      \n      This case report is, to our knowledge, the first published case documenting the use of Phesgo® in a hemodialysis patient. No new safety signs were seen, and activity was documented, adding support to the use of this drug combination in such a patient population.",
