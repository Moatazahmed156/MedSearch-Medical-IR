    "abstract": "In the last decade, several reports suggest that oestrogen replacement therapy (ORT=ERT=estrogen replacement therapy) might prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease. Oestrogens influence and modulate brain structure and brain function. There are substantial arguments that the postmenopausal oestrogen loss might, together with other factors, accelerate the appearance of Alzheimer's disease. The evidence is suggestive, but not compelling, that ORT can reduce the relative risk to suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, recent findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oestrogens might ameliorate the symptomatology in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, it has to be remembered that in most clinical trials the number of oestrogen users was quite small, and, usually, oestrogen use was not randomised. The aim of the present review is to discuss the data available today in view of their clinical relevance.",
