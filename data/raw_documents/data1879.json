    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Using a population-based database, this study investigates the risk factors, epidemiology, and outcomes of basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) of the head and neck.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was analyzed for all patients with BCAC of the head and neck from 1973 to 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three hundred and twenty-two cases of BCAC of the head and neck were identified. Mean age of diagnosis was 64.1 years. 52.5% were male and 77.3% were white. The most common primary site was the parotid gland (71.7%). Most patients underwent surgery alone (51.9%). Five-year disease-specific survival (5Y-DSS) was 95.6%, and 10Y-DSS was 90.3%. Highest survival was seen with surgery alone followed by combined surgery and radiation (10Y-DSS: 93.9% vs. 88.9%, p = 0.001). Age, primary site, T-classification, grade, and treatment type significantly affected survival.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      BCAC of the head and neck presents most frequently in the parotid glands. Surgery alone is associated with highest survival.",
