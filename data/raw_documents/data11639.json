  "title": "Management of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.",
  "abstract": "New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common arrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Traditionally regarded as a benign and self-limiting event, more recent evidence highlights its association with prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare utilization, and a heightened risk of stroke, recurrent atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Understanding its significance is essential for patient care and long-term outcomes. PubMed was searched using terms related to POAF and CABG, supplemented by the review of relevant guidelines and key publications. This narrative review summarizes recent evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, prophylaxis, and treatment of POAF after CABG. Evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis (e.g. amiodarone, beta-blockers,) and surgical strategies (e.g. posterior pericardiotomy, atrial pacing) is summarized, along with current approaches for acute management and stroke prevention. The literature reveals significant heterogeneity in treatment strategies, particularly regarding anticoagulation, with emerging trials expected to refine clinical practice. Current evidence suggests that POAF functions more as an indicator of underlying patient vulnerability than as a direct driver of adverse outcomes. Clinically, management must balance arrhythmia control, stroke and bleeding risk, and individualized anticoagulation decisions. Research efforts should prioritize robust risk stratification tools and randomized evidence to guide tailored therapy.",
