    "abstract": "Pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an increasingly utilized, life-saving technology with high mortality and morbidity. A complex technology employed urgently or emergently for some of the sickest children in the hospital by a large multidisciplinary team, ECMO is an ideal area for using quality improvement strategies to reduce the variability in care and improve patient outcomes. We review critical concepts from quality improvement and apply them to patient selection and management, staffing, credentialing and continuing education, and the variability of management among providers and institutions.",
