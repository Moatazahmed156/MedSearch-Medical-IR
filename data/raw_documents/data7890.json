    "abstract": "Treatment effectiveness for kidney disease is limited by lack of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers. The gold standard test renal biopsy along with serum creatinine and proteinuria is often necessary to establish a diagnosis, particularly in glomerular disease. Proteomics has become a powerful tool for novel biomarker discovery in kidney disease. Novel proteomics offer earlier and more accurate diagnosis of renal pathology than possible with traditional biomarkers such as serum creatinine and urine protein. In addition, proteomic biomarkers could also be useful to choose the most suitable therapeutic targets. This review focuses on the current status of proteomic biomarkers from animal models (5/6 nephrectomy, unilateral ureteral obstruction, and diabetic nephropathy) and human studies (chronic kidney disease, glomerular diseases, transplantation, dialysis, acute and drug-induced kidney injury) to assess relevant findings and clinical usefulness. Current issues and problems related to the discovery, validation, and clinical application of proteomic biomarkers are discussed. We also describe several proteomic strategies highlighting technologic advancements, specimen selection, data processing and analysis. This review might provide help in future proteomic studies to improve the diagnosis and management of kidney disease.",
