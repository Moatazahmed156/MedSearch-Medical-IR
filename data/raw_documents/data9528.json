  "abstract": "Food literacy and mindful eating are increasingly recognized as key factors in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, particularly Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). This study aimed to assess the association between food literacy and mindful eating and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. This cross-sectional study included 1091 adults (777 females, 314 males) aged 18-65 years. General characteristics, anthropometric measurements, risk of T2DM (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score-FINDRISC) and MetS (Metabolic Syndrome Index), food literacy (Food Literacy Tool), and mindful eating (Mindful Eating Inventory) were assessed using a questionnaire. Food literacy and mindful eating scores were significantly and negatively correlated with both the FINDRISC score (r = -0.153 and r = -0.168, respectively; p < 0.001) and the Metabolic Syndrome Index score (r = -0.181 and r = -0.171, respectively; p < 0.001). Linear regression analyses indicated that age, marital status, education level, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and total scores from the Food Literacy Tool and the Mindful Eating Inventory were significant predictors of the risk of T2DM (R",
