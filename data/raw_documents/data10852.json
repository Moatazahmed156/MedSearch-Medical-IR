  "title": "Asthma Prevalence and Risk Factors Among Farmers in the Midwestern United States: Analysis of Regional Surveillance Data.",
  "abstract": "This study examined the prevalence and risk factors for asthma among farm and ranch operators in seven Midwestern States, using surveillance data from 2018, 2020, and 2023. Regression models were developed to identify predictors of asthma, including demographic factors, agricultural exposures, and physical activity. The overall prevalence of asthma was 4.7%. Asthma was significantly associated with respiratory exposures to grain, feed, or hay dust [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.14, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.74-2.63] and animal confinement dust [AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.35-2.21] after adjusting for demographics and worktime on farm/ranch. The identified occupational risk factors highlight the importance of surveillance and targeted prevention among agricultural populations to further reduce the long-term respiratory exposures, particularly in animal confinement operations.",
