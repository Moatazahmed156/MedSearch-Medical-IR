  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a serious public health problem, mainly due to the difficulty in healing chronic wounds, which present an inflammatory response for long periods of time and are more vulnerable to infections. Hydrogels are a promising therapeutic solution due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to allow controlled release of therapeutic agents. The addition of bioactive glasses doped with therapeutic ions to hydrogels can also provide specific biological responses to the system and thus improve tissue regeneration. In this study, a hydrogel based on carboxymethylcellulose and polyethylene glycol with different degrees of crosslinking and enriched with 10% by weight of CeO",
