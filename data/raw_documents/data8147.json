    "abstract": "In summary, many questions still need to be answered about spinal cord injury. Research into newer methods of care are still important for the future of these persons. We would all like to see a cure. We must not be satisfied, however, with the status quo of care until a cure is possible. Our goals of care, gadgetry, and research must be geared to meet the needs of our patients and not the egos of health professionals and researchers. In other words, make the care, the machine, and the research fit the person, for after all, we are talking about people with spinal cord injury.",
