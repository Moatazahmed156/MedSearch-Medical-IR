    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease that often affects the foot and ankle. Approximately 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis present initially with foot and ankle symptoms, and most patients will eventually develop foot and ankle symptoms. Although early intervention includes conservative measures, operative treatment often is needed to adequately treat rheumatoid patients. Treatment of foot and ankle problems in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is directed to maintaining ambulatory capacity. This article reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the foot and ankle.",
