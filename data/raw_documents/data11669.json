  "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed aberrant expression patterns of the autophagy-associated transmembrane protein etoposide-induced 2.4 (EI24) in diverse cancer types, prompting investigations into its potential as a biomarker for cancer. These findings underscore the multifaceted roles of EI24 in regulating critical processes such as tumor metastasis, proliferation, angiogenesis, drug resistance, tumor microenvironment, and autophagy, both indirectly and directly. Such insights also provide a foundation for further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of EI24's involvement in tumorigenesis, thereby facilitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we present the latest advancements in EI24 research within the realm of tumor biology. We delve into the intricate molecular mechanisms governing EI24's functions across various tumor types and its diagnostic and prognostic significance. In addition, we analyze emerging therapeutic strategies targeting EI24 in tumors, offering insights into its potential as a future therapeutic target. A comprehensive understanding of EI24's role in tumor biology is crucial for devising innovative therapeutic approaches tailored to the diverse complexities of various cancer types. By integrating mechanistic insight with translational potential, EI24 represents a key node linking biological understanding to next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic innovations.",
