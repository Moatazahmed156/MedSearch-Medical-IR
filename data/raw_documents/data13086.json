  "title": "Senotherapeutics for Brain Aging Management.",
  "abstract": "Brain aging is a progressive process marked by cellular dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. A growing body of evidence identifies cellular senescence, the accumulation of non-dividing, metabolically active cells with a pro-inflammatory secretory profile (SASP), as a key contributor to cognitive decline and brain aging. This review explores the emerging field of senotherapeutics, which includes senolytics (agents that eliminate senescent cells) and senomorphics (agents that suppress SASP without killing cells), as potential strategies to manage brain aging. We summarize recent preclinical studies demonstrating that senotherapeutics can reduce neuro-inflammation, improve synaptic plasticity, and enhance cognitive function in aged animal models. Additionally, we highlight early-phase clinical trials investigating senolytic compounds in Alzheimer's disease and discuss key challenges, including the delivery of drugs to the brain, biomarker development, and long-term safety. The review concludes that senotherapeutics, particularly when combined with personalized and multimodal approaches, represent a promising avenue for mitigating age-related cognitive decline and promoting healthy brain aging.",
