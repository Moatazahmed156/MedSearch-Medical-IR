    "abstract": "Numerous studies have confirmed that D2 lymphadenectomy is the standard surgery for locally advanced gastric cancer. Standardized lymph node dissection plays a crucial role in ensuring surgical quality and efficacy. It is recommended to perform D2 lymph node dissection according to the 6th edition of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines. For lymph nodes beyond the scope of D2 lymph node dissection, such as No.10, 13, 14v, 16 and mediastinal lymph nodes, selective D2+ lymph node dissection can be performed, which may be advantageous for some patients. Currently, omentectomy is the standard surgical procedure for locally advanced gastric cancer. However, the clinical significance of gastrectomy with preservation of the greater omentum requires further validation through large-scale clinical trials. Standardized ex vivo lymph node dissection is important for accurate postoperative staging, and it is recommended to harvest more than 30 lymph nodes to avoid staging deviation.",
