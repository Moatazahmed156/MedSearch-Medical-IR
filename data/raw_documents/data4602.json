    "abstract": "X-linked dominant inheritance with lethality in hemizygous males is a rare mode of inheritance. The three best-known disorders which seem to be inherited in this way, are incontinentia pigmenti (IP) Bloch-Sulzberger, oral-facial-digital I (OFD I) syndrome, and focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH syndrome, Goltz syndrome). It is the purpose of this article to give a review of the clinical and genetic aspects of the above-mentioned diseases and to add those disorders in which this mode of inheritance is discussed. These disorders are: X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (CP), cervico-oculo-acusticus syndrome (Wildervanck syndrome, COA), congenital cataract with microcornea or slight microphthalmia, muscular dystrophy--hemizygous lethal, partial lipodystrophy with lipatrophic diabetes and hyperlipidemia, Aicardi syndrome, coxo-auricular syndrome, and Johanson-Blizzard syndrome. OTC deficiency is included in the study, although there is no lethality in utero, only in the neonatal period. A critical evaluation of the current literature is carried out.",
