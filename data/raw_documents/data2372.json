    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To provide an overview of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship concerns surrounding endometrial cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      A review of articles dated 2006-2018 from PubMed and NCCN guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy. Staging and treatment are primarily surgical, with adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy administered as indicated by grade and stage.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for nursing practice:\n        \n      \n      Cancer prevention, response to treatment, and quality of life can be affected by lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise, and tobacco use. Nurses in diverse roles and practice settings can educate patients about lifestyle choices that can affect individuals across the cancer trajectory.",
