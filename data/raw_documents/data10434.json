  "title": "Hybrid Revascularization Approach Using Robot-Assisted Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery Grafting.",
  "abstract": "Hybrid coronary revascularization combines minimally invasive surgical coronary artery bypass grafting with percutaneous coronary intervention. This case report describes a 72-year-old male with multivessel coronary artery disease treated using a hybrid approach: robot-assisted bilateral internal mammary artery grafting followed by percutaneous coronary intervention. This method leverages the strengths of both modalities, offering tailored treatment for specific coronary lesions. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up demonstrated excellent outcomes.",
