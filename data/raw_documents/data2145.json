    "abstract": "Spontaneous spinal cord infarction is significantly less common than cerebrovascular disease. Because of the tight anatomical distribution of pathways in the cord, small spinal cord infarcts usually give more obvious symptoms and signs than similar lesions in the brain. Large epidemiological stroke studies have generally not included spinal cord stroke and so the incidence of vascular syndromes in the spinal cord is unknown. Management and prevention strategies for spontaneous spinal cord infarcts stem from small case series and case reports. Patient outcomes from spinal cord infarction are better with prompt recognition, timely management and prevention of associated medical complications arising from paraplegia, tetraplegia, neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction. The process of rehabilitation following spinal cord infarction is an evolving area.",
