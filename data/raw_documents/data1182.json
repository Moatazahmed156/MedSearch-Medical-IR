    "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a promising gut microbiota for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A. muciniphila stimulates intestinal wall integrity, is an anti-inflammatory agent, and reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. These properties make A. muciniphila a potential treatment option for T2DM by reducing insulin resistance and increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in different tissues. This article explores the possible role of A. muciniphila in T2DM management, along with the various methods known to modulate A. muciniphila.",
