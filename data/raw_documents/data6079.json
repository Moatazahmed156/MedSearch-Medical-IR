    "abstract": "As an initial step for curriculum review, reevaluation, and change for a physical therapy undergraduate education program, a comprehensive list of competencies that would be appropriate for present-day rehabilitation health needs was developed, field tested, and rated by a target population of physical therapists practicing in the province of Quebec. The physical therapists surveyed represented all graduates of three university physical therapy programs who had been practicing in Quebec for up to three years and all directors of physical therapy services in the province. The 176 respondents rated 224 competency statements first according to their perceived level of importance in their clinical practice and second according to the respondents' self-evaluation of their level of competence. An analysis of the ratings of the importance and level of competence in relation to clinical practice, years of experience, and type of position indicates some needed changes in physical therapy education programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels and in continuing educational programs.",
