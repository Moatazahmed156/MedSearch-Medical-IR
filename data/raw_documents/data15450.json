  "abstract": "Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) represent an emerging public health threat in China. Despite evidence of rising NTM prevalence and significant regional variation, comprehensive and up-to-date nationwide data on epidemiology, species distribution, and drug resistance patterns have been lacking. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the prevalence, geographical and temporal trends, species composition, and antimicrobial resistance of NTM in mainland China and Taiwan from 2013 to 2024. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42024540102) included 43 studies (2013-2024) encompassing 17,959 NTM isolates from 225,733 suspected TB patients. Stata software was used for meta-analysis with a random-effects model; publication bias was assessed via Egger's test and funnel plots. The pooled NTM prevalence among suspected tuberculosis patients was 11.27% (95% CI: 9.89-12.65%), with marked geographic variation: highest in northeast (24.18%) and southeast coastal regions (12.83%), and lowest in southwest (2.30%). Slowly growing mycobacteria accounted for 68.07% of isolates, dominated by  NTM prevalence in China has continued to rise over the past decade and now exceeds many global estimates, with pronounced coastal-southern predominance. The persistently high resistance to standard antituberculosis drugs underscores the urgent need for standardized diagnostic protocols, mandatory NTM reporting, enhanced surveillance networks, and region-tailored treatment guidelines. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42024540102.",
