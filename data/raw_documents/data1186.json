    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic metabolic age-associated disease. Elderly patients over 65 years of age predominate among those with type 2 diabetes. 70% of patients with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. The article presents data on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes in the Russian Federation. It also reflects information about the impact of lifestyle and aging on the progression of carbohydrate metabolism disorders. The paper presents studies that prove the possibility of preventing the transition of prediabetes to diabetes. Various methods of preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus, including lifestyle changes, medications, and metabolic surgery in patients with prediabetes, are being considered. Particular attention is paid to the effectiveness and possibility of using these methods of prevention in the elderly in general.",
