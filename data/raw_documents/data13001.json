  "title": "Mesoporous PdPt Nanozymes with Target Peptides and Cascade Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging for Boosting Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that has become a major health problem nowadays. Inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides has made progress in AD treatments. Here, we synthesized mesoporous PdPt nanozymes to immobilize target peptide KLVFFAED for high-efficiency AD treatment. Thanks to the high surface area of the mesoporous nanospherical structure of PdPt nanozymes, lots of KLVFFAED were grafted with a concentration as high as 439.2 μg mL",
