  "abstract": "Short stems in total hip arthroplasty (THA) have the potential to improve periprosthetic bone preservation compared to conventional stems due to a more anatomical distribution of biomechanical force. This study is a follow-up study of a randomised controlled trial using ultra-short and conventional stems in THA with the aim to investigate the long-term changes in periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) at 6 and 10 years post-THA. A cohort of 51 patients with hip osteoarthritis were randomized to either an ultra-short stem ( 37 hips, 17 ultra-short stems and 20 conventional stems, were followed up until 10 years. At 6- and 10-years post-THA, the ultra-short stem group had less periprosthetic BMD reduction compared to the conventional stem group in Gruen zone 1; mean differences (%) were -17.6 (CI, -23.4--10.6) and -18.3 (CI, -28.0--9.0), respectively ( Over a 10-year follow-up, THA using an ultra-short stem exhibited significantly reduced periprosthetic BMD loss in Gruen zone 1 compared to the conventional stem but this did not result in better clinical results. The observed preservation of bone density suggests potential long-term advantages of the ultra-short stem in minimising stress shielding and maintaining periprosthetic bone quality.
