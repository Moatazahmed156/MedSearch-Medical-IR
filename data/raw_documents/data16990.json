  "title": "The whole-brain dynamic neuromagnetic network characteristics in childhood absence epilepsy: A multi-frequency magnetoencephalography study.",
  "abstract": "This study was aimed to explore the mechanisms of seizure initiation, propagation, and termination in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) by analyzing dynamic whole-brain network changes. We recruited 37 unmedicated children with CAE and recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data from 65 seizures and interictal periods. The seizure course was time-segmented, and a dynamic frequency analysis was conducted. Functional connectivity (FC) was assessed using corrected amplitude envelope correlation (AEC-c), and total node strengths were calculated based on AEC-c values. Total node strength exhibited distinct temporal and frequency-specific changes. Preictally, it increased in all frequency bands except alpha (P < 0.05). Ictally, it decreased below interictal levels in the delta/theta bands but increased in all others (P < 0.05). Postictally, it remained altered. Regarding FC, brain network reorganization began as early as the preictal phase. At seizure termination, beta synchronization declined first, while delta and gamma2 showed a transient peak. This study characterized the dynamic reconfiguration of whole-brain functional networks across seizure phases in CAE, highlighting time- and frequency-specific changes. By framing CAE as a network disorder, this study emphasized the importance of frequency-specific analyses in epilepsy research and provide insights to guide future frequency-targeted diagnostics and therapies.",
