  "title": "Stent-Free PCI With OCT-Guided Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty for Calcified Coronary Stenosis After Kawasaki Disease.",
  "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) may cause coronary aneurysms and calcified stenosis, posing challenges for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The role of drug-coated balloons (DCB) in this context remains uncertain. We report a 25-year-old man with prior KD who developed 90% calcified stenosis at the inlet of a left anterior descending artery aneurysm. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed severe calcification. Predilatation with a cutting balloon followed by paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty achieved lumen enlargement without dissection. Six-month angiography and OCT showed a patent vessel with smooth healing, and the patient remained event-free during 4 years of follow-up under antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy. This case highlights that intravascular imaging-guided, stent-free PCI with DCB may offer a feasible revascularization approach for KD-related calcified coronary stenosis, although long-term efficacy requires further evaluation.",
