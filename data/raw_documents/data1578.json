    "abstract": "Ophiopogonis Radix, a well-known Chinese herb, is dominantly cultivated in Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces, with the Zhejiang Ophiopogonis Radix acting as one of the eight Zhejiang-based traditional medical materials. Phytochemical studies have shown that Ophiopogonis Radix is rich in steroidal saponins, homoisoflavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides, which collectively confer it with cardiovascular protection, anti-inflammation, anticancer, antioxidation, and immune regulation activities. Studies also show that Ophiopogonis Radix originated from Zhejiang and Sichuan is discriminated in both chemical components and clinical efficacy, while the existing reviews of Ophiopogonis Radix appear to pose a particular focus on Sichuan species, but not for Zhejiang origin. This article systematically summarizes the structures and bioactivities of the compounds sourced from Zhejiang Ophiopogonis Radix as well as its molecular pharmacognosy and it will set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of geo-authentic Ophiopogonis Radix.",
