    "abstract": "Endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide. One in four cases will be diagnosed before menopause. Endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH) is a precursor of endometrial cancer and tends to occur at a young age. Those who have early stage, grade 1 EEC or EAH and wish to preserve their fertility can be managed with hormonal therapy. Hysteroscopic treatment in addition to progestin therapy has been used more commonly in the last decade. Herein, a review of available data on hysteroscopic treatment in EEC and EAH is presented.",
