  "title": "Preoperative intravenous indocyanine green injection demarcates tumor border and adjacent nerves in surgical resection of posterior mediastinal neurogenic tumors.",
  "abstract": "Surgical resection of posterior mediastinal tumors may lead to postoperative complications such as Horner's syndrome and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Previous studies have shown that indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence can visualize sympathetic ganglia and various tumors. We present the novel use of ICG NIR fluorescence imaging in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the resection of posterior mediastinal tumors. A 66-year-old female patient was diagnosed with a posterior mediastinal tumour adjacent to the T3 vertebra, measuring 5.5 × 3.9 cm. Preoperative administration of ICG at a dose of 5 mg/kg facilitated complete resection of the tumour without postoperative complications. This case illustrates the potential of ICG NIR imaging to enhance the safety and efficacy of VATS for complex posterior mediastinal tumors.",
