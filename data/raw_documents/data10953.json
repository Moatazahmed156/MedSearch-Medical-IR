  "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are cornerstone treatment for inflammatory diseases but are limited by systemic toxicity from high-dose and prolonged use. Encapsulation of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) in autologous erythrocytes aims for sustained drug release with an improved safety profile. This manuscript summarizes early clinical studies of encapsulated DSP (eDSP) in pulmonary and inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD). From 2001 to 2013, eight clinical studies investigated eDSP in patients whose age ranged from 5 to 83 years, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). DSP was loaded into autologous erythrocytes ",
