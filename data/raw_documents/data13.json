    "abstract": "Physical activity is one of the most powerful tools for enhancing health and longevity, offering benefits that range from improved brain function and cardiovascular health to reduced risks of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative conditions. Regular movement, whether aerobic, anaerobic, strength training, or balance exercises, positively impacts metabolism, immune function, mental well-being, and aging. Although not a cure-all, exercise is a cornerstone of preventive medicine, reinforcing the importance of an active lifestyle. By integrating physical activity with proper nutrition and overall wellness strategies, individuals can optimize their health span, ensuring a longer, healthier life.",
