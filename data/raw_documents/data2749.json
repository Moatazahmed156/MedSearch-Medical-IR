    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization has caused environmental problems such as the urban heat island and air pollution, which are unfavorable to residents. Urban traditional blocks are facing the dual challenges of restoration and protection. This paper proposes adaptive transformation strategies for improving the microclimate of traditional areas. We selected Baxian'an Block in Xi'an city, simulated the air temperature and wind speed during summer and winter using ENVI-met, and studied the correlationship between morphological parameters (average building height, building density, enclosure degree, height fall, aspect ratio, and sky view factor) and air temperature and wind speed ratio. The case study revealed that the wind speed ratio of Baxian'an is relatively different in summer, reaching a maximum of 0.61, meaning that the ventilation capacity is significantly affected by the architectural form of the block. Finally, suggestions for the optimal design of the block's form are provided: the building density should be less than 50%, the average building height should be more than 50 m, the enclosure degree should be less than 0.2, the height fall should be more than 41.7 m, and the sky view factor should be less than 0.5. This study can provide data and support for improving the planning and design standards of traditional residential areas.",
