  "abstract": "Violence is a major public health concern, but long-term hospital-based analyses in Latin America remain scarce. This study examined trends, structural breaks, and seasonality of violence-related emergency visits at the José Casimiro Ulloa Emergency Hospital in Lima, Peru, between 2015 and 2024. A retrospective analysis of 14,570 visits was performed, classifying cases according to the World Health Organization typology into self-inflicted, interpersonal community, and interpersonal family violence. Descriptive statistics were stratified by sex, life stage, migratory status, and pandemic period: pre-pandemic (2015-2019), pandemic (2020-2021), and post-pandemic (2022-2024). Time-series analyses included segmented regression and seasonal-trend decomposition. Males (78.3%), youth, and adults were the most affected groups. Interpersonal community violence accounted for 94.2% of cases and closely mirrored the overall series, peaking at 327 visits in July 2019 and falling to 28 in April 2020. Segmented regression showed significant immediate decreases at the onset of the pandemic (-71.6 visits, ",
