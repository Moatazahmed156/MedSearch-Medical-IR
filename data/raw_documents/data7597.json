    "abstract": "As research disciplines differ from each other in terms of their epistemological and theoretical assumptions, they differ in the kinds of data they produce. This paper discusses the particular perspectives and methods that anthropologically produced data contribute to a biopsychosocial paradigm of alcohol use/pathology. Strategic uses of qualitative research approaches are suggested, and situations in which qualitatively produced data would be especially useful in the design and delivery of alcohol-related services are identified.",
