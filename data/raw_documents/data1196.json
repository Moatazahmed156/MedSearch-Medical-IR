    "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to examine thiol-disulfide balance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study included 32 subjects with known type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications, 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with complications, 28 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 45 healthy individuals. Thiol-disulfide profile tests were quantified in all groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Compared to the control group, patients in each of the diabetic groups had significantly lower native and total thiol levels, higher disulfide levels, and higher disulfide/native thiol and disulfide/total thiol ratios (p<0.05 for all). Disulfide levels were significantly lower in the newly diagnosed group than in other diabetic groups (p<0.05). There were significant associations between glycemic parameters and thiol-disulfide tests (p<0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A disequilibrium between thiol-disulfide pairs occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a gradual increase to disulfide levels may contribute to the disease's severity. Deteriorated thiol-disulfide homeostasis may be relevant to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
