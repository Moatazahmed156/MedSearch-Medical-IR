  "title": "AGEs promote the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells via centrosome amplification by KLF5-CEP57L1 axis.",
  "abstract": "Despite the accumulating evidence that diabetes and centrosome amplification (CA) are both associated with cancer cell metastasis, in particular the observations in gene-edited animal models, their relationships and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown under pathophysiological conditions. In the present study, we examined if CA could serve as a biological link between diabetes and metastasis. Our results showed that, in vitro, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) promoted CA, migration, and invasion of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, with highest CA level in the migrated cell fraction, and upregulated FAM111B which promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Upon AGEs treatment, KLF5, KLHL13, and CUL3 were down- and CEP57L1 was up-regulated, respectively; the latter was due to an insufficient KLF5-mediated transcription of KLHL13 and CUL3, and therefore compromised protein ubiquitination degradation. Importantly, AGEs promoted CEP57L1-dependent metastasis of the cancer cells in mouse model. In a cohort of cancer patients, KLF5, KLHL13, and CUL3 levels were lower but CA and CEP57L1 were higher in cancer tissues, compared with non-cancerous counterparts, which were more obvious in those with diabetes. Decreased KLF5, KLHL13, and CUL3, together, was associated with poorer survival. In conclusion, it is suggested that AGEs promote the cancer cell metastasis via CA by KLF5-CEP57L1 axis, which underlies diabetes-promoted cancer metastasis.",
