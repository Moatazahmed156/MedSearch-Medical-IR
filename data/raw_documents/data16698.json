  "title": "The effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in epilepsy comorbid with migraine on the EEG power spectrum: a randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "Migraine is a common comorbidity in patients with epilepsy, with a comorbidity rate ranging from 9.3 to 34.7%. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is an emerging therapy used in both epilepsy and migraine treatment. However, there are currently no randomized controlled studies (RCTs) using taVNS for epilepsy complicated with migraine. In this study, we evaluated the effect of taVNS as an adjuvant therapy on patients with comorbid epilepsy and migraine. Forty comorbid patients (taVNS  The frequencies of migraine attacks and seizures significantly decreased in the taVNS group from baseline to 24 weeks (migraine attack frequency,  In comorbid patients in our groups, taVNS can decrease the frequency of seizures, improve mood and quality of life, and reduce the EEG power spectrum.",
