    "abstract": "What enables well-being when experiencing existential concerns as a young adult is an under-explored area of research. In order to address young adults' existential concerns and provide caring support that builds their resilience to meet life challenges, the purpose of the study is to describe the meaning of enabling well-being as experienced by young adults living with existential concerns. This phenomenological study is based on a reflective lifeworld research. Seventeen young adults, aged 17-27 years, were interviewed. The results is presented in an essential meaning and further explored with its variations and individual nuances of the phenomenon; enabling well-being. The essential meaning of enabling well-being, when experiencing existential concerns as a young adult, means finding a place to rest. Finding a place to rest means finding both movement and stillness in life to reflect upon one's life story in order to understand oneself. The results also show that young adults enable their own well-being in many ways when experiencing existential concerns. When their existential concerns feel overwhelming, they need support from healthcare professionals. When young adults seek professional support, the professionals must be open and focus on the young adults' life story to enable well-being.",
