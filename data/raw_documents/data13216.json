  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia BioClotAD involves four partners in three European countries with complementary expertise, using extensive in vitro, ex vivoand in vivo assays, including AD animal models and human AD brain samples. Our project is based on three blocks: 1) Testing the FBP to in vivo detect the cerebral occlusions by nuclear imaging. 2) Detecting fibrin deposits inside the brain parenchyma with FBP coupled to a transferrin receptor antibody (FBP-TfR) to facilitate BBB crossing BioClotAD provides feasible neuroimaging strategies to in vivo detect the fibrin cerebral accumulation of AD models and identify the specific regional distribution in the brain. Our project will set the basis for future clinical trials on neuroimaging of the cerebral fibrin accumulation in AD. BioClotAD neuroimaging biomarkers will allow the early detection of the pro-thrombotic state in AD, opening a window of opportunity to delay the disease progression by personalized anticoagulant therapies.
