    "abstract": "Myocardial energy substrate metabolism entails a complex system of enzyme catalyzed reactions, in which the heart efficiently converts chemical to mechanical energy. The system is highly regulated and responsive to changes in workload as well as in substrate and hormone supply to the heart. Akin to the terms \"contractile reserve\" and \"coronary flow reserve\" we propose the term \"metabolic reserve\" to reflect the heart's capacity to respond to increases in workload. The heart's metabolic response to inotropic stimulation involves the ability to increase oxidative metabolism over a wide range, by activating the oxidation of glycogen and carbohydrate substrates. Here we review the known biochemical mechanisms responsible for those changes. Specifically, we explore the notion that disturbances in the metabolic reserve result in contractile dysfunction of the stressed heart.",
