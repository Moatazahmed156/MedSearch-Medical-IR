  "title": "Relationship between lead exposure and different types of hypertension: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the association between environmental and occupational lead exposure and the risk of various hypertension subtypes. We further evaluated this relationship through a dose-response analysis to provide a scientific basis for targeted public health interventions. Observational studies on lead exposure and hypertension were searched from Chinese/English databases (inception to June 9, 2025). Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed bias risk. Random-effects meta-analysis calculated pooled ORs (95% CIs); meta-regression/subgroup analyses explored heterogeneity. Egger's test evaluated publication bias, sensitivity analyses verified result robustness, and dose-response analysis was applied to multi-level exposure data. 24 studies (181,500 participants) were included. Lead exposure correlated significantly with hypertension (pooled OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.20-1.34) with high heterogeneity (I Lead exposure is a hypertension risk factor with a clear dose-response relationship. It is recommended to include blood lead in hypertension risk assessment and set a blood lead action level of < 0.107 μg/dl for high-risk groups to reduce hypertension burden from lead pollution. https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2025-9-0008/.",
