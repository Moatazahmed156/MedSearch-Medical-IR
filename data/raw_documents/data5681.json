    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput 'omics' technologies has improved our knowledge of gut microbiome in human health and disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder. Frequent bidirectional communications and mutual regulation exist between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. A large body of research has reported a close association between the gut microbiota and AD development, and restoring a healthy gut microbiota may curb or even improve AD symptoms and progression. Thus, modulation of the gut microbiota has become a novel paradigm for clinical management of AD, and emerging effort has focused on developing potential novel strategies for preventing and/or treating the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the connection and causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and AD, the mechanisms of gut microbiota in driving AD progression, and the successes and challenges of implementing available gut microbiome-targeted therapies (including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation) in preventive and/or therapeutic preclinical and clinical intervention studies of AD. Finally, we discuss the future directions in this field.",
