  "title": "A predictive model for multimodal rehabilitation efficacy in post-stroke patients with lower limb motor impairment.",
  "abstract": "To explore the feasibility and clinical value of constructing a therapeutic efficacy prediction model for patients with lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke who received conventional treatment combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) mirror therapy training, based on age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, baseline FMA score, FES stimulation intensity, FES stimulation frequency, and mirror therapy training duration. A total of 510 patients with lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke admitted to the hospital from January 2022 to October 2024 were selected and divided into a training set ( The effective treatment rate was 65.83% (235/357) in the training set and 64.05% (98/153) in the validation set. Multivariate regression showed that age, baseline NIHSS score, baseline FMA score, FES stimulation intensity, FES stimulation frequency, and mirror therapy training duration were independent influencing factors (All  The Nomogram model constructed based on the above indicators can effectively predict the therapeutic efficacy of patients with lower limb motor dysfunction after stroke, providing a basis for clinical individualized intervention.",
