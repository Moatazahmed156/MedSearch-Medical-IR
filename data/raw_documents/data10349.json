  "title": "Coronary artery stenosis, plaque burden, and severity of myocardial ischemia.",
  "abstract": "The relationship between the extent and composition of coronary atherosclerosis and the severity of myocardial ischaemia remains incompletely understood. We assessed whether artificial intelligence-guided coronary computed tomography angiography-derived plaque burden and composition correlate with ischaemia severity. We included 837 symptomatic patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography and subsequent  Artificial intelligence-guided coronary computed tomography angiography-derived measures of plaque burden and stenosis are associated with the severity of myocardial ischaemia, although overlapping distributions across ischaemia severity indicate that anatomical imaging alone may be insufficient for accurate phenotyping of flow-limiting CAD. These findings encourage for the integration of functional imaging with quantitative plaque analysis for a more comprehensive evaluation of coronary artery disease.",
