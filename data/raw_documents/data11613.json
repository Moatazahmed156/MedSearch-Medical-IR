  "title": "Predictive value of serum homocysteine and potassium ion for short-term prognosis of patients with acute cerebral infarction following intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.",
  "abstract": "This study evaluated the predictive value of serum homocysteine (HcY) and potassium ion (K Totally, 140 ACI patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis using rt-PA were finally included and classified into early neurological deterioration (END) and non-END groups. Serum levels of HcY and electrolytes were detected. The 90-day prognosis of patients after thrombolysis was analyzed. Influencing factors for END and poor short-term prognosis in rt-PA-treated ACI patients were identified using stepwise regression models. Correlations of serum HcY and K The END group had higher age, atrial fibrillation, neutrophil ratio, CysC, FIB, FPG, TNF-ɑ, IL-6 and HcY levels, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores on admission but lower serum calcium ion and K Serum HcY and K",
