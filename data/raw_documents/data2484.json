    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a group of heterogeneous chronic inflammatory arthropathies occurring in childhood without a known cause. This article discusses the key clinical features of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treatment updates for oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic arthritis. Paradigm changes in management include the earlier use of biologic agents and the introduction of biosimilars and targeted synthetic disease modifying agents like tofacitinib. This review summarizes recent developments while considering potential areas for improvement and study.",
