    "abstract": "Fifty-five consecutive female volunteers were evaluated. Linear measurements of the breast and nipple position were determined to fixed points on the chest wall. Volume determination was done by a standard chest-wall casting technique. A highly significant difference was found between left and right breasts in the axilla-to-nipple distance and nipple-to-midline measurements. A significant difference was also found in the distance from the lowest point of the breast (patient upright) to the nipple. Analysis of the volumetric difference between right and left breasts did not achieve statistical significance.",
