  "title": "Real-world clinical experience with benralizumab for severe eosinophilic asthma in the Czech Republic: Fewer corticosteroids and better symptom control.",
  "abstract": "Benralizumab suppresses type 2 inflammation and improves outcomes of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). We investigated real-life clinical experience with this biological therapy in Czechia to provide evidence on effectiveness in the context of the local healthcare system. We have analyzed data from the Czech cohort participating in the multi-national observational study BREEZE covering 12 months before the first benralizumab dose and 56 weeks after that. Eligibility included the diagnosis of SEA and at least one dose of benralizumab administered in clinical practice. Descriptive statistics were used, and changes from baseline were assessed using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Patients in the Czech cohort (n = 51; 76.5% women) initiated benralizumab therapy at the mean age of 56.5 years and with median blood eosinophil count of 540 cells/μL, mean annualized exacerbation rate (AER) of 3.84, and poorly controlled asthma (Asthma Control Test [ACT] < 16 in 72.3%). Maintenance oral corticosteroids (mOCS) were used in 51% of patients. During the treatment, complete blood eosinophils depletion was achieved at week (W) 16, resulting in overall relative reduction in AER at W16 and W48 of 88.6% and 91.7%, respectively. The need for mOCS decreased to 23.3% at W48, and ACT scores significantly increased (p < 0.001 for W16 and W24; p = 0.007 for W48). One patient (2%) discontinued benralizumab up to W56. Clinically meaningful benefits of benralizumab treatment were confirmed in the Czech cohort, especially reduction of mOCS need, decrease of exacerbations, and improvement of asthma control.",
