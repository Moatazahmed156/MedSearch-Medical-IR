  "title": "An educational video to promote the use of stigma-free language by primary care clinicians in interactions with adults with type 2 diabetes: a qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability of an educational video among primary care clinicians as a tool to promote the use of stigma-free language in interactions with individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The language used by primary care clinicians in interactions with adults living with T2D can contribute to perceptions and experiences of diabetes-related stigma and be a barrier to achieving and sustaining glycaemic targets. In 2017, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Association for Diabetes Care & Education Specialists (ADCES) issued a guidance paper with recommendations to promote stigma-free communication about diabetes. The educational video, developed by the research team, presents two versions of a vignette in which a nurse practitioner interacts with an adult with T2D in a primary care setting. The first version of the vignette features the nurse practitioner using stigmatizing language as outlined in the ADA and ADCES guidance paper; the second demonstrates the use of stigma-free language by the nurse practitioner. A narrator highlights the linguistic differences. The study participants, comprising physicians ( Three main themes emerged from the data: aligning video content with existing attitudes and beliefs, reducing the use of stigmatizing language, and increasing the use of stigma-free language. Findings suggest that an educational video promoting the use of stigma-free language in interactions with adults with T2D is acceptable among primary care clinicians.",
