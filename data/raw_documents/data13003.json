  "abstract": "This proof-of-concept, dose-finding phase IIb trial evaluated treatment with ABBV-552 compared with placebo in participants with clinically diagnosed mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants aged 50 to 90 years with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 20 to 26 and a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 to 1.0 were randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo or ABBV-552 (1, 5, or 15 mg) daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the 14-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 14) at week 12. Two hundred sixty-three participants were randomized. The least-squares mean difference (vs placebo) in change from baseline at week 12 in ADAS-Cog 14 total score (95% confidence interval) for ABBV-552 1 mg was -0.02 (-1.87, 1.83), nominal p = 0.9819; 5 mg, -0.42 (-2.25, 1.42), nominal p = 0.6545; 15 mg, 0.25 (-1.58, 2.08), nominal p = 0.7860. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 48.5% of ABBV-552 recipients versus 42.2% in the placebo group; no safety concerns were identified. ABBV-552 did not demonstrate a meaningful difference versus placebo on the primary endpoint. ABBV-552 is a small molecule that modulates the SV2A receptor in neurons ABBV-552 may enhance synaptic efficiency leading to improved cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) Participants with mild AD were treated with either placebo, 1 mg, 5 mg, or 15 mg of ABBV-552 covering an estimated 35% to 80% SV2A receptor occupancy in a phase II randomized clinical trial Results failed to show efficacy over placebo as measured by ADAS-Cog 14 at week 12 ABBV-552 was generally safe and well tolerated.",
