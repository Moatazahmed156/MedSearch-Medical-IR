  "title": "Effectiveness of an educational intervention based on the common-sense model of self-regulation for lung cancer patients after thoracoscopic surgery.",
  "abstract": "This study constructed an educational intervention based on the common-sense model of self-regulation for lung cancer patients after thoracoscopic surgery and evaluated the effects of the educational intervention. From July 2023 to January 2024, ninety patients with lung cancer after initial thoracoscopic surgery were divided into an intervention group (N = 45) and a control group (N = 45). Patients in the intervention group received a nursing intervention based on the common-sense model of self-regulation. Patients in the control group received usual care. The intervention group received face-to-face and telephone counselling for 4 weeks, and they had a manual. Pulmonary exercise compliance, frailty, and illness perception were assessed before and after the intervention. After the implementation of the nursing intervention based on the common-sense model of self-regulation, there were statistically significant differences in lung function exercise compliance scores and illness perception scores between the intervention group and the control group, but there was no statistically significant difference in frailty scores between the two groups after the intervention. This educational intervention is effective for the rehabilitation behaviour of lung cancer patients following thoracoscopic surgery. Clinical trial registration: This study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry through this website www.chictr.org.cn , and the registration number is ChiCTR2400087033. The first registration date was 17 July 2024.",
