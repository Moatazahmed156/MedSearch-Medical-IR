    "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD), also well known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is an acute febrile disease in children with systemic vasculitis as its main pathological change, and usually occurs in children under the age of 5. KD is now the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in Japan, Europe and North America. Although KD is now being increasingly diagnosed in mainland China, there is paucity of data on this condition. To provide clinical basis for the treatment of KD, the authors report their experience on 170 children with KD at Shaanxi People's Hospital, Xi'an, China in this research. This also is one of the largest single centre experiences from China so far.",
