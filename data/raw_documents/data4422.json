    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) causes recurrent apnea and intermittent hypoxia at night, leading to several complications such as cognitive dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in OSAS are unclear, and oxidative stress mediated by intermittent hypoxia is an important mechanism. In addition, the improvement of cognitive dysfunction in patients with OSAS varies by different treatment regimens; among them, continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) is mostly recognized for improving cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of oxidative stress in OSAS, the common factors of affecting oxidative stress and the Links between oxidative stress and inflammation in OSAS, focusing on the potential links between oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in OSAS and the potential therapies for neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with OSAS mediated by oxidative stress. Therefore, further analysis on the relationship between oxidative stress and cognitive dysfunction in patients with OSAS will help to clarify the etiology and discover new treatment options, which will be of great significance for early clinical intervention.",
