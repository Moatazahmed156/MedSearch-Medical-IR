    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The prognosis of major renal injuries appears to have improved since a conservative approach has been promoted. The overall prognosis might be less optimistic if all cases are pooled, whatever the type of initial injury (parenchymal or vascular) or the type of treatment (operative or conservative).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The records of 32 children were reviewed. Six patients had a vascular injury, and 26 had a parenchymal injury. Ten were operated on within one month after trauma, and 3 (including one previously operated) underwent delayed surgery for sequelae. Parenchymal loss from atrophy was estimated on echography, computerized tomography, or radionuclide scintigraphy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fourteen patients (44%) recovered a functioning kidney. Nine (28%: all 6 patients with vascular injury and 3 with parenchymal trauma) lost their kidney from nephrectomy (n = 3) or atrophy (n = 6). Seven patients had severe or moderate sequelae from either partial nephrectomy or partial atrophy. Two had a minimal loss from polar hypotrophy. The incidence of kidney loss or sequelae was 56% (18 of 32 patients).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In keeping with the literature data provided all cases are analyzed, at least one out of 4 kidneys will be lost or severely damaged after major kidney trauma in children.",
