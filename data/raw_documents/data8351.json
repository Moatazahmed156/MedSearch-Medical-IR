    "abstract": "Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) affects over 230 million women and girls in more than 90 countries. Despite global condemnation and recognition of FGM as a violation of fundamental human rights, the practice persists, alongside an alarming rise of medicalization - with over 52 million procedures now performed by healthcare professionals. FGM causes severe short- and long-term consequences, including obstetric complications, chronic pain, infertility, sexual dysfunction, and significant mental health burdens. Ending FGM is a medical responsibility and a moral imperative. FIGO unequivocally condemns all forms of FGM, including medicalization, and calls for unified global action. FIGO urges its member societies and healthcare providers to strengthen capacity-building, enforce ethical guidelines, raise community awareness, provide reconstructive care and mental health care, and advance research in this field.",
