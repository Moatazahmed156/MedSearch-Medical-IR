  "title": "Immature Platelet Fraction as a Surrogate Marker of Thrombo-Inflammation in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients.",
  "abstract": "Although COVID-19 is associated with significant thrombo-inflammatory complications, reliable biomarkers to guide antithrombotic therapy remain limited. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) reflects platelet turnover and may indicate heightened thrombotic risk. We retrospectively analyzed 133 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age 68 years) at a single center. IPF and inflammatory markers (WBC, ANC, D-dimer, LDH, CRP) were measured on admission. Correlations between IPF and these biomarkers were assessed overall and in clinical subgroups (age, sex, disease severity, comorbidities, and treatment). We found that IPF was positively correlated with WBC and ANC in patients less than 70 years old (r = 0.36 and 0.33, respectively; ",
