  "abstract": "PurposeTo present the first case of multifocal vitelliform paravascular retinopathy (MVPR) identified in Turkey and to describe its multimodal imaging features and clinical course.MethodsA 59-year-old woman underwent a routine ophthalmic examination during evaluation for a chalazion. Comprehensive multimodal imaging, including fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography (FA), was performed.ResultsBest-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed multiple, small, round, yellow-white lesions distributed along the vascular arcades and surrounding the macula bilaterally. FAF showed predominantly hypoautofluorescent lesions with areas of mixed hypo- and hyperautofluorescence. OCT sections through the lesions demonstrated disruption of the ellipsoid zone and dome-shaped hyporeflective cavities in the outer retina, while FA revealed hyperfluorescent lesions ( Figure 1). The patient had a history of diabetes and hypertension but no other systemic or ocular disease. Laboratory and systemic imaging findings were unremarkable. Full-field ERG and EOG were within normal limits.ConclusionThis case represents the first reported instance of MVPR in Turkey. The imaging features and benign, asymptomatic clinical course were consistent with those of previously reported MVPR cases. Further studies are required to clarify the underlying pathophysiology and long-term prognosis of this newly described condition.",
