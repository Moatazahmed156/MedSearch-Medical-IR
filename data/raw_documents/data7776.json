    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      There is limited data available specific to young adult tobacco use in Rhode Island. This study examines whether young adult cigarette and e-cigarette use varies by sociodemographics, mental health, and use of other substances.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This cross-sectional web-based survey was administered during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May to October 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 12.9% of young adults reported current cigarette or e-cigarette use. Young adults who currently used cigarettes or e-cigarettes were more likely to be white, non-Hispanic, younger, and have depressive symptoms, a depression diagnosis, suicide ideation, engage in harmful drinking, alcohol dependence, current marijuana use, and frequent marijuana use.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      To address the needs of disproportionately affected young adults, steps must be taken to integrate comprehensive, barrier-free, widely promoted coverage of tobacco cessation treatment in all behavioral healthcare settings.",
