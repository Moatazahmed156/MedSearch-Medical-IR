    "abstract": "CH(3)CO-Thr-Glu-Ser-His-His-Lys-NH(2), a hexapeptide representing the 120-125 sequence of histone H2A, coordinates Cu(II) ions efficiently. Monomeric complexes are formed. In the major complex at physiological pH, CuH(-1)L, Cu(II) is coordinated equatorially through the imidazole nitrogen of the His-4 residue and the amide nitrogens of the Ser-3 and His-4 residues, and axially through the imidazole nitrogen of the His-5 residue. This complex reacts with H(2)O(2) and the resulting reactive oxygen intermediate efficiently oxidizes 2'-deoxyguanosine. The underlying mechanism involves the formation of Cu(III) and a metal-bound hydroxyl radical species.",
