  "abstract": "Identify distinct MVPA trajectories between 2 and 12 months post-ACLR and compare tibiofemoral articular cartilage composition changes as well as patient reported outcomes (PROs) between trajectory groups. Device-measured MVPA was collected at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months post-ACLR in individuals with ACLR. MVPA trajectories were identified using grouped-based trajectory modeling. Cartilage composition was measured preoperatively (preop) and at 12 months post-ACLR using change in T1ρ (ΔT1ρ) magnetic resonance imaging relaxation times in the lateral (LFC, LT) and medial (MFC, MT) femoral and tibial compartment. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) was used to assess PROs at preop, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months post-ACLR. Differences in KOOS subscale scores and ΔT1ρ were compared between MVPA trajectory groups. We identified a consistent MVPA (74.5% of cohort) and high-increasing MVPA trajectory (25.5%). The high-increasing trajectory group engaged in more MVPA at all timepoints compared to the consistent group. The high-increasing trajectory group demonstrated greater ΔT1ρ in the LFC (i.e., deleterious changes in cartilage composition, p=0.006) and higher KOOS sport compared to the consistent MVPA group (p=0.037). Individuals between 2 and 12 months post-ACLR most commonly engage in the consistent MVPA trajectory. The high-increasing MVPA trajectory group demonstrated worsening LFC cartilage composition. These data indicate that high MVPA in the first 12 months post-ACLR may be linked to deleterious knee tissue changes but not worse PROs.",
