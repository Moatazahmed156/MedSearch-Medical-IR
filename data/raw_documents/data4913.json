    "abstract": "Twenty-five percent of cases of endometrial cancer appear in women with unfulfilled reproductive desires. An adequate selection of patients and a close hysteroscopic follow-up to monitor the endometrial response to the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) may be a valid and safe option for these patients. This is a case series and review of the literature study. We included eight patients diagnosed of complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (CEHA) or stage 1AG1 well-differentiated endometrial cancer without myometrial invasion who desired to get pregnant and opted for a conservative treatment. Follow-up was performed with hysteroscopy and directed biopsy at 3, 6 and 12 months. Of the 854 cases of complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (CEHA)/endometrial cancer were diagnosed, 2.3% were candidates for conservative management. We obtained a favourable regression of 71.2% at 6 months and 57% at one year with hormonal treatment. Conservative treatment in complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (CEHA)/low-grade endometrial cancer in reproductive age patients with a strong desire for pregnancy is feasible.",
