  "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5) virus continues to spread in animals with ongoing concern for potential human transmission. We describe an adaptable H5 screening approach that integrates clinical laboratory workflows with research-developed assays. This strategy efficiently screened thousands of samples, providing a practical and scalable model for H5 surveillance.",
