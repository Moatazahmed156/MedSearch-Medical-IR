    "abstract": "Heart failure presents a particularly difficult public health challenge. Of the heart failure presentations, acute hypertensive heart failure represents a distinct clinical phenotype and is characterized by sudden-onset systemic hypertension and pulmonary edema. The pathophysiology of acute hypertensive heart failure is primarily driven by an abnormal ventricular-vascular relationship, and the medical management is aimed at improving this relationship.",
