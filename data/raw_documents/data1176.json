    "abstract": "Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally and has been recognized as a common complication of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus. Heart failure occurs in diabetic patients even in the absence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, or valvular heart disease, and is, therefore, a major cardiovascular complication in this vulnerable population. Given the continued rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide, the burden of heart failure on the healthcare system will continue to increase. Recent evidence demonstrates that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, brings clinical benefit to patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein, we critically reviewed the clinical evidence of empagliflozin for patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus with the comparison with other sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and potential mechanism to provide the optimal and evidence-based management for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus with the goal to be conducive to the mechanism exploration of empagliflozin to advance a more comprehensive understanding of empagliflozin.",
