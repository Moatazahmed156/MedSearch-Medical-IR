    "abstract": "Advanced lung cancer is becoming a chronic disease threatening human life and health. Cachexia has been recognized as the most common problem associated with advanced lung cancer. Lung cancer-induced cachexia seriously affects patients' quality of life. The present article summarizes the pathogenesis of advanced lung cancer-induced cachexia from three aspects: anorexia, cytokines, and energy and metabolic abnormalities. In addition, the present article proposes corresponding nursing measures based on cachexia pathogenesis to improve the quality of life and survival rate of cachectic patients with advanced lung cancer by combining continuously advancing treatment regimens and effective nursing. The present article also provides references for healthcare professionals when administering related treatments and nursing care.",
