  "title": "Synthetic Flozins in Cancer Prevention and Combination Strategies: Structural Insights and Therapeutic Potential.",
  "abstract": "The growing number of cancer cases highlights the urgent need to develop new therapies based on effective molecules. Although anticancer activity remains a key element of oncological pharmacology, the importance of agents that support physiological functions and improve the quality of life of cancer patients is also recognised. Compounds that combine these two functions could represent a significant trend in oncology. Moreover, repurposing approved drugs for conditions beyond their original indications could be a promising strategy. An interesting example of this is synthetic flozins (SGLT2 inhibitors), which were originally designed and developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. These compounds contain various aromatic and heteroaryl structures, and changes in these substituents affect the binding strength and therapeutic potency of SGLT2 inhibitors. Beyond their antidiabetic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors exert well-documented cardioprotective and nephroprotective actions, restoring metabolic homeostasis. Given these pleiotropic properties, they could benefit oncology by improving systemic functions and by directly influencing the invasion of cancer cells. This article provides an overview of the use of synthetic flozins in various contexts, with a particular focus on their potential impact on cancer biology and treatment, consolidating their position as multifunctional agents of growing systemic relevance.",
