    "abstract": "The nature and severity of an acute myocardial infarction may be related to the region of myocardial involvement. Four possible sites of infarction are inferior, anterior, posterior, and lateral. Knowledge of ECG tracings common to each of these areas, the coronary artery source of each, clinical complications, and signs and symptoms is vital to subsequent nursing management.",
