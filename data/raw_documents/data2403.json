    "abstract": "Context:\n        \n      \n      Every year, approximately 0.4 million women suffer from endometrial cancer (EC) worldwide and it has become the most common gynecological malignancy. Almost 66% of EC cases are diagnosed at an early stage and can be cured by performing surgery while those at an advanced stage turns out to be fatal. Biomarkers of endometrial cancer would be very valuable for screening of women who are at high risk and in detecting the chance of recurrence of disease.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The current article has reviewed studies published on expression of biomarkers and susceptibility to EC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Google Scholar and PubMed were used as searching platforms and we have majorly considered the literature from last 10 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Potential biomarkers of EC identified from various studies were summarised.",
