  "title": "Integrated stress response inhibition prolongs the lifespan of a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease mouse model by increasing oligodendrocyte survival.",
  "abstract": "The leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is caused by myelin protein proteolipid protein gene (PLP1) mutations. PMD is characterized by oligodendrocyte death and CNS hypomyelination; thus, increasing oligodendrocyte survival and enhancing myelination could provide therapeutic benefit. Here, we use the PMD mouse model Jimpy to determine the impact of the integrated stress response (ISR) on the oligodendrocyte response to mutant PLP expression. Male Jimpy animals in which the ISR-triggering eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α kinase, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), is inactivated have an extended lifespan that correlates with increased oligodendrocyte survival and enhanced CNS myelination. Inactivation of downstream components of the ISR pathway, in contrast, does not rescue oligodendrocytes or myelin. Phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits the exchange factor eIF2B, resulting in diminished protein synthesis. Treatment with small molecule eIF2B activators 2BAct and ISRIB increases oligodendrocyte survival, CNS myelination, and doubled the Jimpy lifespan. These results suggest that ISR modulation could provide therapeutic benefit to PMD patients.",
