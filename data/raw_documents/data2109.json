    "abstract": "The increase in lung cancer incidence of Korea has been dampened since 2000; however, increased human lifespan, interest in health care and the widespread implementation of health examinations have resulted in a considerable rise in detection of small lesions that need to be differentiated from lung cancer. Detection of lung cancer at an early stage rather than at a symptomatic advanced stage is also increasing, suggesting that there are increasing diagnostic demands for small peripheral lung lesions. The development of new molecular diagnostics, including next generation sequencing, companion diagnostics that accompany development of new anti-cancer drugs, and re-biopsy for application of new therapeutic modality accelerate the development of lung cancer diagnostics. In this review, we extensively describe the current available diagnostic tools in lung cancer.",
