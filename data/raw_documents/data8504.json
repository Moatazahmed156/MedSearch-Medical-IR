    "abstract": "After a short summary of the biological basis of the immune checkpoint inhibitors used for the treatment of nonhematologic solid tumors, the issues of pseudoprogression, hyperprogression, and immune-related side effects are discussed as well as their implications for patient management. Recommendations are provided for performing 18F-Fludeoxyglucose PET scanning, assessing tumor response, and reporting immune-related side effects, with representative clinical cases.",
