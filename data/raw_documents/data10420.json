  "title": "Administration of Single or Repeated Doses of CDCs in a Swine Model of Reperfused Myocardial Infarction: Magnetic Resonance and Proteomics Evaluation.",
  "abstract": "Some studies report better outcomes in cell therapy for myocardial infarction (MI) with repeated administrations. We aimed to elucidate the potential differences in terms of cardiac function and protein expression after one or three doses of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) in a porcine MI model. CDCs were isolated from swine cardiac explants, cultured in cardiomyocyte growth medium (CGM), and prepared for administration. Pigs surviving a 90 min balloon occlusion of the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were randomly allocated to receive vehicle (CON), one (D1), or three (D3) doses of 30 × 10",
