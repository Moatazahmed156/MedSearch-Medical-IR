  "abstract": "To describe the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and a control group, and identify associated factors. Adults of any sexual orientation with PsA (CASPAR criteria) or RA (EULAR/ACR 2010 criteria) were consecutively included in this cross-sectional observational study. The Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) was self-administered to evaluate variations in sexual function due to disease or medication. We also evaluated the potential association of sociodemographic and clinical data with SD. Results were compared with a control group of healthy individuals. Overall 188 individuals were included, 72 with PsA and 27 with RA. In total, 30.43%, 48.15% and 5.88% of the PsA, RA and control groups, respectively, had scores within the SD range. The overall patient population had a mean CSFQ-14 score 8.2 points lower than the control group. All domains of the CSFQ-14 questionnaire were negatively affected by PsA or RA (p<0.001). The risk of SD is associated with age, sex, perceived health, employment situation, and economic status. The estimated odds ratio of having SD was 8.7 times higher in patients diagnosed with PsA and 10 times higher in patients diagnosed with RA. Patients with RA or PsA have a poorer sexual life in all sexual sphere domains, compared to a healthy population. Our study confirms the value of the CSFQ-14 questionnaire for assessing sexual health and as a tool for the integral management of patients with chronic joint diseases.",
