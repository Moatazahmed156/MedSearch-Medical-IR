    "abstract": "The primary cilium is a hair-like sensory compartment that protrudes from the cellular surface. The primary cilium is enriched in a variety of signaling molecules that regulate cellular activities. Stem cells have primary cilia. They reside in a specialized environment, called the stem cell niche. This niche contains a variety of secreted factors, and some of their receptors are localized in the primary cilia of stem cells. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the function of cilia in compartmentalized signaling in stem cells. We describe how ciliary signaling regulates stem cells and progenitor cells during development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. We summarize our understanding of cilia regulated signaling -primary involving the hedgehog pathway- in stem cells in diverse settings that include neuroepithelial cells, radial glia, cerebellar granule neuron precursors, hematopoietic stem cells, hair follicle stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and mammary gland stem cells. Overall, our review highlights a variety of roles that ciliary signaling plays in regulating stem cells throughout life.",
