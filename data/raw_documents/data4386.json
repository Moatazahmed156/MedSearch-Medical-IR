    "abstract": "Both acute and chronic tendon injuries are disabling sports medicine problems with no effective treatment at present. Sustained oxidative stress has been suggested as the major factor contributing to fibrosis and adhesion after acute tendon injury as well as pathological changes of degenerative tendinopathy. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the inhibition of oxidative stress can promote the tenogenic differentiation of tendon stem/progenitor cells, reduce tissue fibrosis and augment tendon repair. This review aims to systematically review the literature and summarize the clinical and pre-clinical evidence about the potential relationship of oxidative stress and tendon disorders. The literature in PubMed was searched using appropriate keywords. A total of 81 original pre-clinical and clinical articles directly related to the effects of oxidative stress and the activators or inhibitors of oxidative stress on the tendon were reviewed and included in this review article. The potential sources and mechanisms of oxidative stress in these debilitating tendon disorders is summarized. The anti-oxidative therapies that have been examined in the clinical and pre-clinical settings to reduce tendon fibrosis and adhesion or promote healing in tendinopathy are reviewed. The future research direction is also discussed.",
