    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers can be used as a paradigm for exploring \"big data\" applications in oncology. Computational strategies derived from big data science hold the promise of shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms driving head and neck cancer pathogenesis, identifying new prognostic and predictive factors, and discovering potential therapeutics against this highly complex disease. Big data strategies integrate robust data input, from radiomics, genomics, and clinical-epidemiological data to deeply describe head and neck cancer characteristics. Thus, big data may advance research generating new knowledge and improve head and neck cancer prognosis supporting clinical decision-making and development of treatment recommendations.",
