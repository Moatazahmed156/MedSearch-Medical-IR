    "abstract": "The ovary is a complex structure that is responsible for maintaining the endocrine support for a pregnancy during the first trimester until the placenta is sufficiently developed to assume this role. Most ovarian disorders of pregnancy actually relate to pre-existing ovarian conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and premature ovarian insufficiency. Both of these are associated with increased complications in pregnancy and require careful monitoring. Ovarian disorders that are a particular consequence of the hormonal milieu of pregnancy such as pregnancy luteoma (PL) and hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) are rare. However, they have important implications for both the mother and the foetus since they can be confused with ovarian malignancy leading to unnecessary surgery. This review focuses on the salient aspects of management of these ovarian conditions during pregnancy.",
