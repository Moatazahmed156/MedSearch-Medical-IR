    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly being integrated into our daily lives and many aspects of society. AI is viewed as a new opportunity to promote independent living and well-being for older adults. AI literacy plays an important role in older adults' acceptance and use of AI-enabled products and services. However, to our knowledge, no research has investigated AI literacy among older adults. The study aims to address this gap by collecting and analysing data on older adults' knowledge and understanding of AI and their experiences and concerns regarding AI-enabled products and services. In total, 207 older adults, aged 60 years and over, participated in the study, including 182 who answered a survey and 25 who participated in semi-structured interviews. The results show a variety levels of AI literacy among the participants. Many are interested in learning more about AI so they can make informed decisions about AI-enabled products and services. This study has not only produced insights into AI literacy among older adults but also contributed to increasing the awareness of AI among the participants and has provided recommendations on measures to enhance older adults' AI competencies.",
