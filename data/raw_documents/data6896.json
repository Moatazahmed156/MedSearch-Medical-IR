    "abstract": "Temperature management has been used in patients with acute brain injury resulting from different conditions, such as post-cardiac arrest hypoxic-ischaemic insult, acute ischaemic stroke, and severe traumatic brain injury. However, current evidence offers inconsistent and often contradictory results regarding the clinical benefit of this therapeutic strategy on mortality and functional outcomes. Current guidelines have focused mainly on active prevention and treatment of fever, while therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has fallen into disuse, although doubts persist as to its effectiveness according to the method of application and appropriate patient selection. This narrative review presents the most relevant clinical evidence on the effects of TH in patients with acute neurological damage, and the pathophysiological concepts supporting its use.",
