  "title": "[Clinical pathway and expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of bone metastases from lung cancer (2025 edition)].",
  "abstract": "Bone metastasis from lung cancer is one of the common complications in patients with advanced lung cancer, which can lead to pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone surgery, bone radiotherapy, and other skeletal related events (SREs), severely affecting the quality of life and prognosis of patients. The Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology convened a multidisciplinary expert panel comprising specialists from respiratory medicine, oncology, orthopedics, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, radiology, and oral and maxillofacial surgery to develop this consensus. It is based on domestic and international evidence-based medicine and clinical practice experience, and was formulated through repeated consultations and thorough discussions. The consensus provides nine recommendations from six perspectives: diagnosis, screening, treatment strategies, bone-targeted drug treatment strategies and management of adverse reactions, local treatment, and efficacy evaluation. These recommendations are intended for reference and used by relevant medical personnel. The development of this consensus aims to provide scientific and practical guidance for clinicians, with the expectation of improving the quality of life and prognosis of patients. 肺癌骨转移是晚期肺癌患者常见的并发症之一，可导致病理性骨折、脊髓压迫、骨手术和骨放疗等骨相关事件，严重影响患者的生活质量和预后。中国临床肿瘤学会非小细胞肺癌专业委员会组织呼吸科、肿瘤科、骨科、放疗、核医学科、影像科及口腔颌面外科医师，结合国内外循证医学证据及临床实践经验，反复磋商和充分讨论制定，从肺癌骨转移筛查、诊断、治疗策略、骨靶向药物治疗策略及不良反应管理、局部治疗、疗效评估等6个角度提出了9条共识建议，供相关医务人员参考使用。共识的制定将为临床医师提供科学、实用的诊疗参考，以期改善患者的生存质量和预后。.",
