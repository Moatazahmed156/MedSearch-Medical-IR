    "abstract": "Stem cell therapies are progressively redefining the treatment landscape for a spectrum of neurological and age-related disorders. This review discusses the molecular and functional attributes of stem cells, emphasizing the roles of neural stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in the context of neurological diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The review also explores the potential of stem cells in addressing the aging process. The paper analyzes stem cells' intrinsic properties of self-renewal, differentiation, and paracrine effects, alongside the importance of laboratory-modified stem cells like induced pluripotent stem cells and transgenic stem cells. Insights into disease-specific stem cell treatments are offered, reviewing both successes and challenges in the field. This includes the translational difficulties from rodent studies to human trials. The review concludes by acknowledging the uncharted territories that warrant further investigation, emphasizing the potential roles of stem cell-derived exosomes and indole-related molecules, and aiming at providing a basic understanding of stem cell therapies.",
