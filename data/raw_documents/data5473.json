    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a highly prevalent malignancy in Asia; however, its incidence is rising in the United States. Traditionally, methods of treatment include surgery and chemotherapy. Endoscopy has become an alternative method with a low recurrence rate when used to treat early gastric cancers. Endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are the 2 mainstay methods of endoscopy treatment. They are advantageous compared to surgery as they are less invasive and maintain anatomic integrity for the patient. However, lesion selection is crucial for success. In this article, the authors describe the 2 methods in detail in the treatment of early gastric cancers.",
