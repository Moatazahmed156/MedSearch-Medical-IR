  "title": "Evaluation of Pancreatic Endocrine Reprogramming in Diabetic Cats.",
  "abstract": "Transcription factors control the development of the endocrine pancreas in various mammals. In humans, paired box-4 (PAX4) and aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) allocate endocrine progenitor cells toward β-cell and α-cell specification, respectively. In adulthood, PAX4 contributes to reprogramming α-cells into β-cells and exocrine into endocrine cells; induction of ARX in β-cells drives them to reprogram into α-cells. Feline diabetes mellitus has a similar pathophysiology to human type 2 diabetes, but information about the role of these transcription factors is unavailable in diabetic cats. The study aim was to test whether diabetic cats have an increased number of pancreatic cells expressing developmental markers of β- and α-cells, respectively, suggesting reprogramming. In 9 diabetic and 9 well-matched control cats, pancreas was collected, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Tissue slides were labelled for insulin, glucagon, PAX4, and ARX. Positive cells for each marker and double-positive cells for their combinations were counted in the pancreas and compared between groups. Against controls, diabetic cats had fewer insulin-positive cells in the islets (",
