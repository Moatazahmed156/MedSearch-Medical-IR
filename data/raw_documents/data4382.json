    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have diverse physiopathological mechanisms with interconnected oxidative stress and inflammation as one of the common etiologies which result in the onset and development of atherosclerotic plaques. In this review, we illustrate this strong crosstalk between oxidative stress, inflammation, and CVD. Also, mitochondrial functions underlying this crosstalk, and various approaches for the prevention of redox/inflammatory biological impacts will be illustrated. In part, we focus on the laboratory biomarkers and physiological tests for the evaluation of oxidative stress status and inflammatory processes. The impact of a healthy lifestyle on CVD onset and development is displayed as well. Furthermore, the differences in oxidative stress and inflammation are related to genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases and the variability in the assessment of CVDs risk between individuals; Omics technologies for measuring oxidative stress and inflammation will be explored. Finally, we display the oxidative stress-related microRNA and the functions of the redox basis of epigenetic modifications.",
