    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is emerging as the most common chronic liver condition in the Western world. It is associated with insulin resistance and frequently occurs with features of the metabolic syndrome. Disease presentation ranges from asymptomatic elevated liver enzyme levels to cirrhosis with complications of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment recommendations are limited to weight loss and exercise, although several promising medications are on the horizon. In this article we discuss the etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as approaches to its management.",
