    "abstract": "Stem cell dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, associated with the decline of physical and cognitive abilities of humans and other mammals [Cell 2013;153:1194]. Therefore, it has become an active area of research within the aging and stem cell fields, and various techniques have been employed to mitigate the decline of stem cell function both in vitro and in vivo. While some techniques developed in model organisms are not directly translatable to humans, others show promise in becoming clinically relevant to delay or even mitigate negative phenotypes associated with aging. This review focuses on diet, treatment, and small molecule interventions that provide evidence of functional improvement in at least one type of aged adult stem cell.",
