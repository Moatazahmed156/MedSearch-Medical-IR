    "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that alterations in gut microbiota play a significant role in the progression of various diseases, including those affecting the eyes. The association between gut microbiota and eye health is an emerging focus of research. This review seeks to summarize the connection between the gut microbiome and specific eye conditions, such as ocular surface diseases, funduscopic disorders and immune-mediated eye diseases. Gut microbiota may influence these conditions by regulating the immune system or altering metabolites, thereby contributing to disease development. Strategies like probiotics, antibiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal transplants show promise in addressing these issues. This review examines how the gut microbiome may be linked to the pathogenesis of eye diseases, providing fresh therapeutic perspectives for ophthalmology.",
