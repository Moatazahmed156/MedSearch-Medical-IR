  "title": "The Efficacy and Safety of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Diabetes Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have shown cardiorenal benefits in the general population; however, evidence regarding their efficacy and safety in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) remains sparse. This meta-analysis seeks to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibitors specifically in the diabetes KTR population. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis following a registered protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42023404886). A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases up to October 23  A total of seven studies comprising 2,713 patients were included in this analysis. SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c levels (WMD -0.37%; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.01; p = 0.04) and BMI (WMD -0.89 kg/m  SGLT-2 inhibitors effectively reduced mortality, cardiovascular disease, HbA1c levels and BMI in KTRs without increasing the risk of infections or allograft rejection. However, they did not demonstrate a significant benefit in kidney-related outcomes.",
