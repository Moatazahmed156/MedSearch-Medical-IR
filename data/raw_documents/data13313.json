  "title": "Plasma NFL, GFAP, sTREM2, pTau231, and clinical severity in progressive supranuclear palsy.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate four plasma markers, pTau231, sTREM2, neurofilament light chain (NFL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in relation to disease severity in a Korean cohort of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Baseline data from patients with probable PSP enrolled in the SCANPSP cohort (NCT05579301) were compared with those of age-matched healthy controls (HC). Four plasma markers measured using the Simoa method, clinical findings, and volumetric 3 T MRI were investigated. This study included 68 patients with PSP and 30 HC. Group level difference were found in NFL, correlating with the PSP-rating scale (r = 0.48, p = 2.0·10 This study demonstrated the feasibility of using four plasma markers simultaneously to determine PSP disease severity. To verify these findings, longitudinal analyses are necessary.",
