  "title": "Cardiovascular, respiratory and splenic responses to rebreathing and apnoea during exercise.",
  "abstract": "We investigated integrative physiological responses to eupnoeic exercise (EX), rebreathing exercise (RB), dynamic apnoea (DA) and dynamic apnoea with cold-water face immersion (DAFI) in 20 healthy participants. Trials involved non-steady-state cycle exercise at 60 W for an average duration of 66 s. With increases in heart rate and stroke volume, EX and RB increased cardiac output compared with baseline (mean [SD] EX +47 [13]%, RB +43 [15]%). During DA and DAFI, the increase in cardiac output was attenuated (DA +26 [23]%, DAFI +14 [21]%). EX and RB elicited reductions in total peripheral resistance (EX -37 [7]%, RB -23 [15]%). This reduction was absent during apnoeas (DA +3 [31]%, DAFI +15 [40]%). Pulmonary oxygen uptake was the lowest during DAFI. At the end of hypoxic trials, end-tidal partial pressures of O",
