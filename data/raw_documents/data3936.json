    "abstract": "No comparative effectiveness data exist on nonopioid analgesics and nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics to treat pain with anxiety. We examined the relationship between drug class and central nervous system (CNS) active drug polypharmacy on pain and anxiety levels in Medicare enrollees receiving home health (HH) care. This retrospective cohort study included enrollees with diagnoses and 2+ assessments of pain and anxiety between HH admission and discharge. Three sets of linear regression difference-in-reduction analyses assessed the association of pain or anxiety reduction with number of drugs; drug type; and drug combinations in those with daily pain and daily anxiety. Logistic regression analysis assessed the effect of medication number and class on less-than-daily pain or anxiety at HH discharge. A sensitivity analysis using multinomial regression was conducted with a three-level improvement to further determine clinical significance. Of 85,403 HH patients, 43% received opioids, 27% benzodiazepines, 26% gabapentinoids, 32% selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 8% serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). Furthermore, 75% had depression, 40% had substance use disorder diagnoses, and 6.9% had PTSD diagnoses. At HH admission, 83%, 35%, and 30% of patients reported daily pain, daily anxiety, and both, respectively. Central nervous system polypharmacy was associated with worse pain control and had no significant effect on anxiety. For patients with daily pain plus anxiety, pain was best reduced with one medication or any drug combination without opioid/benzodiazepine; anxiety was best reduced with combinations other than opiate/benzodiazepine. Gabapentinoids or SNRI achieved clinically meaningful pain control. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provided clinically meaningful anxiety relief.",
