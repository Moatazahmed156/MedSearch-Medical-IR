    "abstract": "Even though people with spinal cord injury are usually followed by a spinal cord injury specialist, studies show that they continue to be monitored by their general practitioner. In Switzerland, over a one-year period, 88 % of spinal cord injury patients consult their general practitioner. The five most common health problems reported by people with spinal cord injury are pain, spasticity, neurogenic disorders of bladder and bowel function, and urinary tract infections. Even if these are common problems in primary care medicine, it is important for general practitioner to be aware of the specificities of spinal cord injury patients, to ensure optimal management. This article provides some useful information on the management of spinal cord injured patients in outpatient care.",
