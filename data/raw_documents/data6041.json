    "abstract": "Heart failure and myocardial infarction, global health concerns, stem from limited cardiac regeneration post-injury. Myocardial infarction, typically caused by coronary artery blockage, leads to cardiac muscle cell damage, progressing to heart failure. Addressing the adult heart's minimal self-repair capability is crucial, highlighting cardiac regeneration research's importance. Studies reveal a metabolic shift from anaerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in neonates as a key factor in impaired cardiac regeneration, with mitochondria being central. The heart's high energy demands rely on a robust mitochondrial network, essential for cellular energy, cardiac health, and regenerative capacity. Mitochondria's influence extends to redox balance regulation, signaling molecule interactions, and apoptosis. Changes in mitochondrial morphology and quantity also impact cardiac cell regeneration. This article reviews mitochondria's multifaceted role in cardiac regeneration, particularly in myocardial infarction and heart failure models. Understanding mitochondrial function in cardiac regeneration aims to enhance myocardial infarction and heart failure treatment methods and insights.",
