  "title": "Preliminary insights into the gut microbiota of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Vietnam.",
  "abstract": "In Vietnam, rheumatoid arthritis accounts for more than 20% of all joint diseases, with a growing number of young patients. The disease progresses rapidly, but its exact cause remains not fully understood. Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, pollution, obesity, gut microbiota, and infections, play a role in rheumatoid arthritis development. The presence of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut might promote the release of toxic metabolites into the bloodstream, which in turn triggers joint inflammation. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to compare the gut microbiota in 22 patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and 20 healthy individuals recruited at the Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. To this end, we analyzed fecal samples from all participants by 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. The sequencing data analysis did not reveal any significant differences in alpha diversity between patients and healthy controls. Conversely, unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances (beta diversity metrics) allowed distinct clustering between groups. The abundance of the ",
