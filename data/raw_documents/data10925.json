  "title": "BREVIBACTERIUM CASEI CATHETER-RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION IN AN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENT WITH MULTIORGAN FAILURE IN DUBAI HOSPITAL, UAE.",
  "abstract": "Brevibacterium casei, historically regarded as a harmless skin commensal, is increasingly recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections (CRBSIs) due to B. casei remain rare but are clinically significant, particularly among patients with multiple comorbidities and indwelling vascular devices. We report a CRBSI caused by B. casei in a 69-year-old male with Ischemic Heart Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Acute Kidney Injury. The diagnosis was established through blood cultures from both a Dialysis catheter and a Peripheral vein. The patient showed clinical improvement following Catheter removal and a combination of Piperacillin-Tazobactam with Levofloxacin.",
