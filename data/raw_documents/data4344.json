    "abstract": "The aim of this chapter is to review the results of recent studies analyzing the role of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation as potential contributors to frailty and CVD, and to explain a possible pathogenic relationship between the latter two conditions. Available evidence suggests that frail patients have elevated levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as with reduced concentrations of endogenous antioxidants. This implies that oxidative stress and systemic inflammation might play a role in the pathogenesis of frailty, but an underlying mechanism of this relationship is still mostly hypothetical. Oxidative stress and systemic inflammation are also involved in the pathogenesis of CVD. Cardiovascular conditions are established risk factor for frailty and in turn, presence of frailty constitutes an unfavorable prognostic factor in cardiac patients. Finally, some cardiovascular risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, obesity and inappropriate diet, are also involved in the etiology of oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and frailty. This complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic elements should be considered during holistic management of older persons with frailty and/or cardiovascular conditions.",
