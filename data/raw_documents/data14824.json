  "title": "Primary Biliary Cholangitis With Incomplete Response to Conventional Therapies But Had Complete Response to Baricitinib: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "Primary biliary cholangitis is a progressive disease with complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the treatment goal is to delay its progression. One of the markers for treatment response is alkaline phosphatase levels. Baricitinib has been used in one randomized controlled trial involving two patients to improve outcomes in unresponsive primary biliary cholangitis. We present a case of primary biliary cholangitis who had incomplete response to ursodeoxycholic acid, obeticholic acid, and fenofibrate but showed complete response to baricitinib in terms of sustained normalized alkaline phosphatase levels.",
  "disease": "liver cirrhosis"
