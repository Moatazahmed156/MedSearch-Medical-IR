  "title": "AASLD AST Practice Guideline on adult liver transplantation: Candidate evaluation.",
  "abstract": "Liver transplant is a specialized treatment for a spectrum of indications that use a scarce resource. Transplant is guided by principles of justice, equity and benefit with a constant conflict between competing interests. Organs are a national resource with a goal of equitable distribution across sites. An AASLD guideline for the evaluation and selection of appropriate transplant candidates has been available since 2005. A multidisciplinary writing group of liver transplant experts and a librarian convened over 24 months. The writing group reviewed the literature, generated guideline recommendations and rated the level of evidence for each recommendation based on the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. The group categorized the strength of recommendations based on the level of evidence, risk-benefit ratio, and patient preferences. Liver transplant is a lifesaving procedure that should be offered to selected patients with clear indications and a reasonable prospect of benefit. The evaluation is designed to identify those in need, to outline hurdles to a successful outcome, and to develop an effective transplant plan. The goal of this document is to provide a template for this process.",
