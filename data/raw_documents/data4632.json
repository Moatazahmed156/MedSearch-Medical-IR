    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women and accounts for almost 18.4% of all deaths due to cancer worldwide, with the global incidence increasing by approximately 0.5% per year. Lung cancer is regarded as a devastating type of cancer owing to its high prevalence, reduction in the health-related quality of life, frequently delayed diagnosis, low response rate, high toxicity, and resistance to available therapeutic options. The highly heterogeneous nature of this cancer with a proximal-to-distal distribution throughout the respiratory tract dramatically affects its diagnostic and therapeutic management. The diverse composition and plasticity of lung epithelial cells across the respiratory tract are regarded as significant factors underlying lung cancer heterogeneity. Therefore, definitions of the cells of origin for different types of lung cancer are urgently needed to understand lung cancer biology and to achieve early diagnosis and develop cell-targeted therapies. In the present review, we will discuss the current understanding of the cellular and molecular alterations in distinct lung epithelial cells that result in each type of lung cancer.",
