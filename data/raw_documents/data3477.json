    "abstract": "Transformations of slow-twitch fibers to the fast-twitch type following spinal cord transection are thought to be related to a substantial decrease or virtual absence of neuromuscular activity. In this experiment, spontaneous activity levels in spinalized and normal cats, raised under similar conditions, were assessed by integrated electromyography (I-EMG) recorded for 240 min over 24 h from the slow-contracting soleus (SOL) and the fast-contracting lateral gastrocnemius (LG). In the SOL of the spinalized cats, there was a 75% reduction in total I-EMG and a 66% reduction in the total duration of muscle activity. Conversely, the LG showed no significant change in total I-EMG, but there was a 66% reduction in the total duration of muscle activity. Based on muscle property data published in companion studies, there was no significant correlation between the SOL total I-EMG and the reduction in contraction times or the decrease in the percentage of slow-twitch fibers determined histochemically. We conclude that transformations of slow-twitch fibers following spinal transection may be regulated by several factors, among which is the total level of spontaneous daily activity.",
