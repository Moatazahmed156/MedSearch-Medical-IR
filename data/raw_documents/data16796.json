  "title": "Effect of Valproate on Serum BDNF and MMP-9 in Pediatric Epilepsy.",
  "abstract": "In recent years, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) have garnered interest for their involvement in epilepsy. This study evaluated the serum levels of BDNF and MMP-9 in pediatric patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls and assessed the effect of valproate on serum BDNF and MMP-9. Children aged 1 year to 12 years, diagnosed with epilepsy (n=30), and age-matched healthy controls (n=30) were included. All participants were followed up for 16 weeks and assessed for changes in serum BDNF and MMP-9 levels. Children with epilepsy had significantly lower BDNF and higher MMP-9 levels compared to healthy controls at baseline. Following 16 weeks of treatment with valproate, BDNF levels were increased significantly ( The findings suggest the involvement of BDNF and MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Serum BDNF and MMP-9 levels were increased and decreased, respectively, following valproate treatment in children with epilepsy. Hence, BDNF and MMP-9 could be potential biomarkers in pediatric epilepsy. Large sample sizes and long-term studies are warranted to confirm the findings.",
