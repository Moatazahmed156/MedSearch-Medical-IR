    "abstract": "Chronic pain and especially back pain rank among the most meaningful medical conditions worldwide. This leads to extensive costs in medical care systems. In about 80-85% of cases there is no morphologic evidence for a possible pain etiology, hence such forms are called \"non-specific back pain\". Therapies with a pure focus on symptomatic aspects are not effective to treat non-specific pain. The origin of chronic back pain can be best explained via a multi causal mechanism with a combination of bio-psycho-social, biographical, neurobiological, genetic, and cognitive factors. Since various aspects of the pain genesis have to be considered, multidisciplinary treatment shows much better results.",
