  "abstract": "There are no available data on the impact of hospitalization on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients receiving home oxygen therapy (HOT). Thus, the present study aimed to examine the association between hospitalization and HRQoL in patients receiving HOT based on the results of the Japanese White Paper on Home Respiratory Care 2024. Patients receiving HOT who completed the HRQoL section of the patient survey, assessed using the Short Form-8 (SF-8) questionnaire, were included in the analysis. This survey data were collected from December 2021 to March 2023. The SF-8 questionnaire comprised eight subitems and two summary scores (physical component summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS]). Hospitalization within the past year were evaluated, excluding those due to coronavirus disease 2019. Totally, 288 patients receiving HOT were examined. In the SF-8 questionnaire survey, all items except body pain and the two summary scores did not differ between patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with interstitial lung disease. Patients who had history of hospitalization had lower scores in all eight subitems and in both summary scores than those who did not. Based on a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, PCS (β = -0.14, p = 0.011) and MCS (β = -0.14, p = 0.014) scores were independently and negatively correlated with hospitalization. A history of hospitalization was independently associated with reduced HRQoL in patients receiving HOT. Prospective studies are needed to clarify underlying mechanisms and to evaluate interventions that may minimize HRQoL decline.",
