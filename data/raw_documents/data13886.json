  "title": "Animal models in human surgery and implant innovation: ethical considerations and scientific advancements.",
  "abstract": "The main aim of biological research is to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and clinical applications so that human health can be improved. Animal models are beneficial in replicating disease mechanisms, facilitating diagnosis, and assessing treatment efficacy for any disease. They play a vital role in drug discovery, toxicological assessments, dosage determination, and the evaluation of side effects, all while adhering to the ethical guidelines. These models are effectively used to treat a wide range of human diseases, including autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular conditions, atherosclerosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome/Coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS/COVID-19), and diabetes. In disease modeling, they significantly contribute to drug development, medical device testing, tissue engineering, wound healing, and bone and cartilage regeneration. One cannot deny the fact that there are major significances of small and large animal models in scientific studies, apart from various advantages and challenges. Animal Models play an essential role in pharmaceutical research, biomedical research, genome editing, transgenic studies, and surgical applications. These models enable scientists and researchers to perform experiments that would be ethically or practically impossible in humans. In recent years, various animal species have been widely used to study health problems, including the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, diabetes, and obesity. Mice, pigs, rabbits, rats, murine, primate, porcine, and aquatic models have played a crucial role in understanding the neurological, behavioral, cardiovascular, and oncological disorders while contributing to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for their treatment. The studies in which pain is inflicted on animals must follow strict ethical standards. Whereas research involving painless animal death is often more accepted because of the fact that animals have limited awareness of their future. This review highlights the use of animal models in indispensable contributions to modern medicine and underscores their relevance in disease research, treatment development, and ethical considerations in experimental studies and their scientific advancements.",
