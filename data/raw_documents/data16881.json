  "title": "Neuromodulation in Refractory Bitemporal Lobe Epilepsy in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Objective Bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy represents a subset of patients with medically intractable epilepsy that is particularly difficult to treat. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three neuromodulation techniques-Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)-in refractory BTLE. Methods In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a thorough electronic literature search using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PubMed databases. Data from the selected studies were extracted, analyzed, and a quality assessment was performed. Meta-analysis was performed comparing mean seizure reduction rates in VNS, RNS, and DBS. Results Twenty studies (4 VNS, 7 RNS, 9 DBS) involving 142 BTLE patients were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of 12 studies (2 VNS, 5 RNS, 5 DBS) revealed comparable efficacy between VNS (61.69%), RNS (67.51%), and DBS (66.68%), with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.932) between the modalities. All three techniques demonstrated efficacy in seizure reduction. Additionally, complication rates did not significantly differ between VNS, RNS, and DBS. (p = 0.85). Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive assessment of existing data regarding the use of neuromodulation in refractory BTLE. VNS, RNS, and DBS demonstrated comparable efficacy, supporting their consideration in treatment planning. Clinical decision-making should weigh factors such as surgical candidacy, patient preferences, comorbidities, and side effect profiles. Further research, including standardized reporting and head-to-head trials, is vital for optimizing treatment protocols and expanding our understanding of neuromodulation's impact on seizure reduction, quality of life, and cognitive outcomes in patients with BTLE.",
