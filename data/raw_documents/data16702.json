  "title": "4-Aminopyridine induced hyperpolarizing oscillations in pediatric human epileptic tissue are network-driven potassium currents that are abolished by activation of KCNQ2-5 (Kv7.2-Kv7.5) channels.",
  "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Despite the availability of many anti-seizure medicines (ASMs), about 30 % of patients with epilepsy develop drug-resistant epilepsy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of ictogenesis in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy remain to be elucidated. Here, we used 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to study interictal-like oscillations in human epileptic neocortex. 4-AP is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker commonly used to induce seizure-like activity in ex vivo brain slices. We observed that 4-AP induced neuronal bursting and robust slow, hyperpolarizing oscillations (HypOs) in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs). Using paired recordings, we demonstrate that neuronal bursting and HypOs are synchronized between neighboring L2/3 PNs. We also determined that 4-AP-induced HypOs are potassium currents that were not mediated by GABA",
