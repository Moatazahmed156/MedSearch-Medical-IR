    "abstract": "Holistic care of the baseball athlete is incomplete without attention to mental health. Baseball athletes are exposed to multiple stressors that may impact mental health negatively, but little is known about the prevalence of mental disorders in this population due to a paucity of research. Several barriers interfere with baseball athletes getting help when needed. Primary prevention, early intervention and screening, and timely access to specialized care are critical in keeping the baseball athlete healthy, safe, and in the game. Athletic organizations that make mental health a priority have an opportunity to destigmatize mental health concerns and transform culture.",
