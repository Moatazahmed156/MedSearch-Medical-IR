  "abstract": "Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is a ubiquitous kinase with cytoprotective and immune-specific functions. Parkinson's disease (PD) animal models disclosed interactions between SGK1 and the critical pathogenic pathways of the disease, whereas human-based evidence is lacking. We investigated the SGK1 contribution to the biological dynamics of PD ex vivo, at immune and systemic level. Thirty-two well-phenotyped PD patients and 34 controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were obtained. PBMCs levels of SGK1, α-synuclein total and oligomeric forms (α-syn PD PBMCs exhibited lower SGK1 (p < 0.001) and higher α-syn In PD patients, SGK1 was downregulated in both PBMCs and serum. Given the preliminary nature of these findings and the co-occurrence of α-syn",
