  "abstract": "Noroviruses are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, with a particularly high burden among children under five years of age. We analyzed nationwide surveillance data from EnterNet-Korea collected between 2019 and 2024-covering both the pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods-to assess norovirus detection rates and genotype distribution. Noroviruses were detected by RT-qPCR, and dual genotyping of capsid (G) and polymerase (P) types was performed by sequencing the ORF1-2 junction region. Among the 67,159 specimens tested, 8.4% (",
