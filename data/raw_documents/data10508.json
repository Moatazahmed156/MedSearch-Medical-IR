  "abstract": "Ongoing debates focus on the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II expression in shaping clinical phenotypes of chronic inflammatory airway diseases. This study seeks to clarify the impact of class II HLA on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). The expression levels of HLA-DQ/DR in blood immune cells were analyzed in 116 participants: 41 with COPD, 37 with ACO, 20 with pure asthma, and 18 healthy subjects (HS). In the COPD group, HLA-DR protein expression levels were significantly elevated on blood M2a monocytes (7695 ± 3743 vs. 5391 ± 3153 MFI,  Up-regulation of HLA-DR in COPD and ACO patients may represent a novel biomarker for assessing disease severity and treatment response. Additionally, it could serve as a useful tool to distinguish COPD and ACO from asthma.",
