    "abstract": "The link between inflammation and tumourisation has long been considered as a key event in clinical cancer development. Inflammation and inflammatory diseases can be caused by many factors including infectious agents, altered genetics and various degrees of injuries from simple cuts to traumatic wounds, such as those suffered in battlefield. Improved management of all wound types is critical in protecting affected individuals against the development of tumourisation cues, which may potentially lead to cancer development. There have been numerous studies on the mechanism of inflammation-induced tumourisation. Thus, in this mini review, we summarised evidence demonstrating the potential link between infectious agents and their moonlight proteins, wounding, trauma, overactive repair mechanisms, and carcinogenesis.",
