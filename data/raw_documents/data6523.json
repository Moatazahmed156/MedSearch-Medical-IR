    "abstract": "The quality of discharge teaching is statistically linked to decreased readmission rates. Nursing most often bears the major responsibility of patient and caregiver teaching. Currently, discharge teaching is complicated by problems including time constraints, patient and caregiver overload, and coexisting comorbidities that add complexity to the patient's care needs at home. Not only are readmissions a preventable cost, more importantly, but they also are a negative patient experience signifying to our patients that they are unable to optimally care for themselves or that their disease or healing is not something they can care for alone. The following is a review of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's IDEAL discharge process, common problems in discharge teaching, and nursing's responsibilities with assessing a patient and his or her caregiver for discharge readiness. IDEAL is a structured discharge process with tools to help healthcare organizations improve their discharge process to decrease readmissions rates.",
