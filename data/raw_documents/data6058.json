    "abstract": "Exposure to x-rays of low intensity immediately arouses the sleeping rat. Activation of the central nervous system, indicated by behavioral and heart rate responses, depends upon the rat but not the dose of exposure. The arousal reaction is not dependent upon direct visual stimulation. The nervous system is probably directly sensitive to ionizing radiation.",
