  "title": "Tuberculosis incidence in solid organ transplant recipients in Europe: A multicenter TBnet cohort study.",
  "abstract": "Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients face elevated tuberculosis risk, yet optimal prevention strategies in low- to medium-incidence regions remain unclear. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult SOT recipients transplanted between 2007-2012 at 15 European centers, with follow-up through 2018. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed post-transplant tuberculosis. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 person-years; standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) used World Health Organization country-specific background rates. Cox models assessed risk factors. Among 5,805 patients (median age 51; 62.7% male; 73.9% renal transplants), 33.8% were tested for tuberculosis infection and 10.3% received tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT). Over 33,785 person-years, 23 patients (0.4%) developed tuberculosis (68.0/100,000 person-years). Highest incidence occurred in patients with positive screening but no TPT (233.8/100,000). Incidence was higher in Southern vs. Central Europe (251.9 vs. 28.7/100,000), with pooled SIRs of 12.8 and 3.1, respectively. Tuberculosis risk was elevated among Southern European recipients (HR 22.9) and those with migration history (HR 2.7). Tuberculosis risk is increased in European SOT recipients. Regionally adapted prevention strategies, including targeted screening in low-incidence areas and universal screening in higher-incidence regions, are warranted.",
