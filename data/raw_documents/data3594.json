    "abstract": "Zika virus disease is of growing concern to all clinicians. There is a growing concern with regards to the neurologic sequela of the virus, particularly for infants born to women infected while pregnant. The continued spread of this virus throughout North and South America requires all anesthesiologists to maintain vigilance on this issue. This article addresses some of the key issues that pertain to anesthesiologists with regards to the Zika virus including the risks of perioperative management of patients with Zika virus. A discussion of the risks of transfusion and current blood management practices also is included in this review.",
