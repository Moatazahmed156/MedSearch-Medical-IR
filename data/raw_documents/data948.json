    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in understanding and treating social anxiety in the general population, progress in this area lags behind for individuals with intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and is associated with an elevated prevalence rate of social anxiety. The phenotype of fragile X syndrome encompasses multiple clinically significant characteristics that are posed as risk markers for social anxiety in other populations. Here, evidence is reviewed that points to physiological hyperarousal, sensory sensitivity, emotion dysregulation, cognitive inflexibility, and intolerance of uncertainty as primary candidates for underlying mechanisms of heightened social anxiety in fragile X syndrome. A multilevel model is presented that provides a framework for future research to test associations.",
