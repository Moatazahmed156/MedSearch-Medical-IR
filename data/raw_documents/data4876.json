Endometrial remodelling during embryo implantation is controlled by decidual cells senescence and effectivity of their immunologic destruction. Endometrial receptivity can be assessed by transcriptomic profiling of endometrial biopsy using ERA system or proteomic analysis of either endometrial secretome or cervical mucus by gel electrophoresis (DIGE) or mass spectrometry (MS).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      With respect to recent discoveries in endometrial physiology and molecular biology, clinical application of proteomic approaches in research of potential biomarkers of endometrial receptivity could be of interest.",
