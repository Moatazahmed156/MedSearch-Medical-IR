  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by structural, functional, and metabolic derangements, remains a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with profound global health burdens. The kidney's high oxygen demand for blood filtration renders it exquisitely sensitive to redox imbalance-an aberration common to both CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI) that, when coupled with iron dysregulation, unleashes ferroptosis: a non-apoptotic, iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant defense impairment (e.g., GPX4/SLC7A11 dysfunction), cascades to which the redox-sensitive kidney is uniquely predisposed. While ferroptosis has been linked to AKI, diabetic nephropathy (DN), and renal fibrosis, existing reviews largely suffer from two limitations: they either focus on single kidney disease entities (e.g., only AKI or DN) or reiterate generic ferroptosis mechanisms, lacking a unified pathophysiological framework that bridges acute insults, chronic fibrosis, and even renal carcinogenesis. Addressing this gap, this review offers three integrated contributions: first, it positions ferroptosis as a convergent metabolic executioner across a broader spectrum of kidney diseases-encompassing AKI, DN, renal interstitial fibrosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)-while emphasizing cell type-specific vulnerabilities: tubular epithelial cells (susceptible via mitochondrial dysfunction), podocytes (via iron overload), and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils/macrophages in SLE nephritis) exhibit context-dependent ferroptosis regulation, governed by cell type-specific modulators [e.g., Nrf2 in tubules, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in macrophages, and sirtuins in podocytes]. Second, it reconciles seemingly disparate findings through a redox-metabolic lens-e.g., dual roles of HO-1 (protective via heme degradation ",
