    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chikungunya is emerging and reemerging word-widely in the past decades. It is non-endemic in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. Aedes albopictus, one of major vectors of chikungunya, is widely-distribution in Zhejiang, and autochthonous transmission is possible after introducing chikungunya virus.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Retrospectively collected the epidemiological, clinical and genetic data of chikungunya and conducted the descriptive analysis and gene sequence analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From 2008 to 2022, 29 chikungunya cases, including 26 overseas imported and 3 local cases, were reported and no cases died of chikungunya. More than half of the imported cases (53.85%) were from Southeast Asia. Seasonal peak of the imported cases was noted between August and September, and 42.31% cases onset in those 2 months. Eight prefecture-level cities and 16 counties reported cases during the study period, with Jinghua (27.59%) and Hangzhou (24.14%) reporting the largest number of cases. The 3 local cases were all reported in Qujiang, Quzhou in 2017. For imported cases, the male-female gender ratio was 2.71:1, 20-30 years old cases (46.15%) and commercial service (42.31%) accounted for the highest proportion. Clinically, fever (100%), fatigue (94.44%), arthralgia (79.17%), headache (71.43%) and erythra (65.22%) were the most common reported symptoms. Eight whole-genome sequences were obtained and belonged to East/Central/South African (ECSA) or Asian genotype.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      With the change of immigration policy, the surveillance of chikungunya should be strengthened and the ability of the case discovery and diagnosis should be improved in Zhejiang in the post-COVID-19 era.",
