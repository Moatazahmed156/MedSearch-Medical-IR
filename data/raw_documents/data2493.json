    "abstract": "OUTCOME IN ADULTHOOD. On average, 40% of juvenile idopathic arthritis remain active in adulthood, with differences according to the type (oligoarticular, polyarticular, enthesitis related arthiritis). It is essential to ensure a link between pediatric and adult follow-up so, to maintain the pediatric diagnosis. The aim is to pursue a therapeutic strategy aimed at maintaining an absence of inflammatory progression, a satisfactory quality of life and to have minimal or no sequelae. The cohorts thus constituted will allow the collection of informative data for the long-term future and the risk of occurrence of comorbidities.",
