    "abstract": "Docetaxel, a semisynthetic taxane, is a potent inhibitor of cell replication and, similar to paclitaxel, promotes in vitro assembly of stable microtubules and, therefore, prevents the depolymerisation process. Docetaxel has a higher affinity for the tubulin subunit and is associated with a 100-fold greater phosphorylation of BCL-2 inducing apoptosis. Docetaxel in combination with carboplatin demonstrates similar activity to paclitaxel/carboplatin in the upfront management of advanced ovarian cancer with less neurological, but greater haematological toxicity. This article reviews the rationale and indications for the use of docetaxel in ovarian cancer.",
