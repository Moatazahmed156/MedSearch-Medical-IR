    "abstract": "Severe ulcerative colitis is usually severe and rapidly progressive, with a particularly high risk of life-threatening complications and colectomy. For ulcerative colitis, surgical treatment may be considered when medical treatment fails. A case of severe ulcerative colitis failed to be treated with conventional drugs, resulting in complications such as hypotension shock, which met the indication of surgery. Since the patient was a young unmarried female, there were risks of life quality, sexual dysfunction, and infertility after surgery. Therefore, after analyzing the reasons for the poor curative effect of internal medicine, taking standardized treatment schemes, fully enhancing nutritional support, regulation of intestinal microecology, and other individualized treatments were taken. The patients changed from severe to mild. It is suggested that nutritional support is as important as drug therapy in ulcerative colitis.",
