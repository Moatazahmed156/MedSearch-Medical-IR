    "abstract": "Penile afferents present in the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP) convey sensory information from the penis to the spinal cord and represent the afferent limb of reflexive erections. Immunocytochemical staining of Fos was used to identify spinal neurons that receive excitatory inputs from the DNP in anesthetized rats. Intracavernous pressure (ICP) was recorded as an index of erection. Dissection as well as stimulation of the DNP elicited a comparable increase in Fos staining. Labeling was present in the dorsal horn, the dorsal gray commissure, and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus, supporting the hypothesis of direct or indirect afferent projection from the penis and penile sheath in these areas. No change in ICP was observed in these rats. Stimulation of the DNP elicited both increased Fos labeling and ICP after spinalization, demonstrating the presence of a supraspinal inhibitory control exerted on the polysynaptic intraspinal circuitry responsible for reflexive penile erection.",
