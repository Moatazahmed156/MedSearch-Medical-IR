    "abstract": "The ever continuing search for risk factors in coronary heart disease must not overshadow psychological data despite the difficulties in conducting surveys. An evaluation of bereavement, a universal manifestation in humans, can provide some answers. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that psychic or somatic complications associated with bereavement are not uncommon and occur in approximately 5% of the cases. Moreover, ischemic heart disease is the most common manifestation of somatic complications. The pathogenic mechanics of ischemic heart disease in bereavement involve both organic and psychological, often intermingled in a complex way leading to accelerated disease progression.",
