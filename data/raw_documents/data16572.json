  "abstract": "Severe influenza infections involve an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory response, which is influenced by both viral and host factors. Protectins PD1 and PDX previously demonstrated anti-influenza activity as well as anti-inflammatory properties. We recently reported that the combination of AN-137B, a molecular analogue of PDX, with oseltamivir or baloxavir provided synergism/additive effects against influenza, ",
