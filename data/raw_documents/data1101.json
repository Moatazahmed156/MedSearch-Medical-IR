    "abstract": "Limited options are available for patients with advanced stage head and neck cancer. The p53 gene is known as the \"guardian of the genome.\" Mutations of the p53 gene predispose to carcinogenesis. The p53 mutations are common in head and neck cancer. Replacement of p53 gene function in preclinical models demonstrates cancer regression and improved survival. Clinical data with an adenoviral based p53 gene delivery product (Advexin) supports safety and clinical response after direct intratumoral injection. We summarize p53-related therapeutics in this review.",
