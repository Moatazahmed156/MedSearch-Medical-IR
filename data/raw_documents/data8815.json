    "abstract": "Applying an equity lens to quality improvement (QI) by collecting, reviewing, and using data that measure health disparities helps identify whether QI interventions improve outcomes evenly and equally across the population or have a greater impact in an advantaged or disadvantaged group. Methodological issues inherent in measuring disparities include appropriately selecting data sources; ensuring reliability and validity of equity data; choosing a suitable comparison group; and understanding between-group variation. The integration and utilization of QI techniques to promote equity is dependent on meaningful measurement to develop targeted interventions and provide a means of ongoing real-time assessment.",
