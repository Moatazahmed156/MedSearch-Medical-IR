    "abstract": "Heart failure remains a health challenge in Africa, associated with significant rates of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. The current review aims to summarize the most recent data on the epidemiology, aetiology, risk factors and management of heart failure, comparing countries in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. There is a paucity of data on heart failure epidemiology, aetiology and management, and on the sociodemographic characteristics of African patients with heart failure. Heart failure prevalence has been evaluated among all medical admissions or admissions to cardiac units or emergency departments in a few hospital-based studies conducted in countries in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Common causes of heart failure in Africa include ischaemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease. The aetiology of heart failure differs between countries in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Diagnosing heart failure proves challenging in Africa because of a lack of basic tools and the necessary human resources. The principal drugs used frequently for heart failure therapy are lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. The clinical profile of heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa differs from that in North African countries; this is related to aetiological factors, socioeconomic status and availability of diagnostic tools. There is an evident need to establish a large multicentre registry to evaluate the heart failure burden in almost all African countries, and to highlight the major cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities. The present review highlights the importance of this syndrome in Africa, and calls for improvements in its early diagnosis, treatment and, possibly, prevention.",
