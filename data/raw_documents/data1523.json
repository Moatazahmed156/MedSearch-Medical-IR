    "abstract": "Heart failure is defined by stages that are based on symptoms from at risk individuals to those with refractory symptoms. Along this continuum of care, we initiate optimal treatment that is then based on an individual's ejection fraction. Therapy is designed to reduce the progression of heart failure while reducing heart failure complications, deaths and hospitalizations.",
