  "title": "Prospect in Alzheimer's disease integrative therapy targeting both amyloid-beta and tau.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is well characterized by the buildup of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Recent prosperous Alzheimer's disease therapeutic development targeting amyloid-β validates the amyloid hypothesis. Nonetheless, the limited efficacy of single-target therapies plus as-observed synergy between amyloid-β and tau calls for a thorough understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Thus, this review introduces Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, specifically focusing on the amyloid-β and tau pathologies, highlights their interconnected nature, presents personal perspectives on therapeutic and diagnostic challenges, and underscores the necessity of combined therapeutic approaches to effectively address Alzheimer's disease.",
