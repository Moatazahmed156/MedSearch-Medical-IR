    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Valve thrombosis is a well-documented cause of bioprosthetic valve failure. Case reports have been published of prosthetic valve thrombosis secondary to COVID-19 infection. This is the first case report of COVID-19 associated valve thrombosis in a patient with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).\n    \n\n\n          Case summary:\n        \n      \n      A 90-year-old female with atrial fibrillation on therapeutic apixaban and status-post TAVR presented with COVID-19 infection and was found to have severe bioprosthetic valvular regurgitation with features suggestive of valve thrombosis. She underwent valve-in-valve TAVR with resolution of valvular dysfunction.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This case report contributes to a growing body of evidence describing the occurrence of thrombotic complications in patients with valve replacement and COVID-19 infection. Increased vigilance and continued investigation are warranted to better characterize thrombotic risk and to inform optimal antithrombotic strategies during COVID-19 infection.",
