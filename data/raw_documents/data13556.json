  "title": "Axial Spinal Traction as a Potential Modulator of Cerebrospinal and Glymphatic Circulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Technical Report and Biomechanical Hypothesis.",
  "abstract": "Impairment of glymphatic function contributes to the accumulation of metabolic and proteinaceous waste products implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and certain spinocerebellar ataxias. Pelvis-stabilized axial spinal traction (PSAST) is a biomechanical technique designed to produce brief, controlled cranio-caudal elongation of the vertebral column and spinal dural sac, potentially generating transient pressure gradients capable of influencing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and glymphatic circulation. The technique has been applied in the author's musculoskeletal practice for more than eight years without observed persistent or treatment-related adverse effects, although such practice-based experience does not constitute a formal safety evaluation. Improved sleep quality has been the most consistently reported patient-perceived response to PSAST, a clinically notable observation given the dependence of glymphatic function on consolidated slow-wave sleep. These practice-based observations provide preliminary, hypothesis-generating support for exploring whether controlled axial elongation may modulate cerebrospinal and glymphatic physiology. To the best of the author's knowledge, this report presents the first peer-reviewed technical description of a reproducible, whole-axis axial spinal traction procedure with defined force parameters intended to examine potential modulation of CSF and glymphatic circulation. The report outlines the PSAST protocol and its biomechanical rationale and safety considerations and proposes its potential relevance as a noninvasive, investigational approach for conditions associated with impaired glymphatic function.",
