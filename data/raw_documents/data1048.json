    "abstract": "Treatment of head and neck cancer with curative intent consists of surgery and/or radiotherapy (RT) sometimes combined with adjuvant chemotherapy depending on the tumor site, extent, and histology. Herein, the authors review the role of RT in the management of head and neck mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The authors focus on the outcomes of definitive RT and, depending on the primary site, postoperative RT. Unless otherwise specified, outcomes data cited are from the University of Florida.",
