    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease of women in the world. Breast cancer often metastasizes to axillary lymph nodes. Accurate assessment of the status of axillary lymph nodes is crucial to the staging and treatment of breast cancer. None of the methods used clinically for preoperative noninvasive examination of axillary lymph nodes can accurately identify cancer cells from a molecular level. In recent years, with the in-depth study of lymph node metastases, the mechanisms and molecular imaging of lymph node metastases in breast cancer have been reported. In this review, we highlight the new progress in the study of the main mechanisms of lymph node metastases in breast cancer. In addition, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of traditional preoperative axillary lymph node imaging methods for breast cancer, and list molecular imaging methods that can accurately identify breast cancer cells in lymph nodes.",
