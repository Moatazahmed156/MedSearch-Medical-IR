    "abstract": "Effective quality improvement (QI) depends on rigorous analysis of time-series data through methods such as statistical process control (SPC). As use of SPC has become more prevalent in health care, QI practitioners must also be aware of situations that warrant special attention and potential modifications to common SPC charts, which include skewed continuous data, autocorrelation, small persistent changes in performance, confounders, and workload or productivity measures. This article reviews these situations and provides examples of SPC approaches for each.",
