    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To review current ovarian cancer prevention and detection recommendations using a risk assessment framework, and discuss the genes related to hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Published articles, consensus opinions, and reports.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Women at highest risk are those with a family history and/or genetic predisposition. Management guidelines include pelvic exam, CA125, and transvaginal ultrasound, although their efficacy is limited. Individualized risk assessment can be useful in assisting women who face decisions regarding prevention options.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for nursing practice:\n        \n      \n      Nurses are challenged to identify women at increased risk for ovarian cancer, and to recognize the complex issues faced when these women pursue screening and prevention strategies.",
