  "title": "Correlation of serum adiponectin with thyroid profile among metabolic syndrome patients with and without hypothyroidism.",
  "abstract": "The Metabolic Syndrome is becoming a more significant global public health condition, and look for reliable, sensitive biomarkers that may be used as diagnostic tools to identify metabolic syndrome. Therefore, it is of interest to correlate the serum adiponectin with thyroid profile in metabolic syndrome patients with and without hypothyroidism. This is a cross-sectional study that included total 120 metabolic syndromes with and without hypothyroidism and 30 healthy controls. The analysis of biochemical and experimental parameters was done. The serum adiponectin was significant and drastically decreased levels was observed in metabolic syndrome patients with and without hypothyroidism and healthy controls (P = 0.001**). It was observed that serum adiponectin was negatively correlated with blood sugars, lipid profile, MDA, TSH and positively correlated with FRAP (P = 0.001**). Thus, we show significantly decreased levels of serum adiponectin among metabolic syndrome patients with and without hypothyroidism might be useful for identify complications like type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.",
