    "abstract": "Proteases play crucial roles in ovarian folliculogenesis, regulating several processes from primordial follicle activation to ovulation and corpus luteum formation. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the diverse functions of proteases in ovarian physiology and pathology. We discuss the classification and regulation of proteases, highlighting their importance in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell signaling, and apoptosis during ovarian follicular development. We explore the roles of several proteases including matrix metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, the plasminogen activator system, and cathepsins, and their roles in the critical functions of ovarian biology including follicle dynamics and senescence. Furthermore, we address the involvement of proteases in ovarian pathologies, including cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, and primary ovarian insufficiency. By integrating recent findings from clinical genomics and animal models, this review provides a comprehensive overview of protease functions in the ovary, emphasizing their potential use for therapeutic interventions in reproductive medicine.",
