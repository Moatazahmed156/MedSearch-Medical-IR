  "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) shares amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition as a pathological hallmark with the extracellular plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While both disease processes involve progressive, decades-long deposition of fibrillar Aβ peptide, they differ in isoform composition. We hypothesized that post-translational modifications (PTMs) on Aβ would also differ between CAA and parenchymal plaques. Using Lys-N enzymatic digestion followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, we profiled Aβ isoforms and N-terminus PTMs (aspartic acid isomerization and pyroglutamate formation) across CAA severity and compared them to parenchymal plaque Aβ in AD. Moderate to severe CAA were dominated by intact N-terminus (Aβ",
