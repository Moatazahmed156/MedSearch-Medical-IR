    "abstract": "For more than 15 years, active clinical research and continuing efforts in the field of CT in head and neck cancer have produced a modest but definite progress and achievements in this disease. We are a long way away from producing more definitive and acceptable results and higher cure rates in this disease. The achievements of systemic CT in patients with head and neck cancers are summarized in this review. Continuing efforts and investigation are needed to study the efficacy of systemic CT in patients with resectable head and neck cancer. We are continuing to investigate the best timing and sequence of CT as part of CMT and then the efficacy of such treatment in patients with resectable cancer. Efforts are underway to improve on the results in patients with NPC and patients with unresectable disease with the use of chemotherapy as part of CMT. Efforts are also underway to consolidate and improve on the results obtained with systemic CT to preserve laryngeal function. We strongly believe that with continuation of these serious efforts further achievement and impact can be obtained with systemic CT as part of other modalities in these patients.",
