    "abstract": "It has been suggested that sleep bruxism may interrupt sleep continuity, hence potentially influencing sleep quality. The aim of this study was to systematically review the relationship between possible, probable, and definite sleep bruxism and sleep quality in otherwise healthy individuals. A systematic search on sleep bruxism and sleep quality was performed in seven databases until 19 December 2022. Eligible articles were screened, and quality assessment was performed via the Joanna Briggs Institute Scale. Of 3681 articles screened, 13 were included in this study. Of these, six evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and possible sleep bruxism, three with probable sleep bruxism, and four with definite sleep bruxism. An association between poor sleep quality and sleep bruxism was found among those individuals diagnosed with possible and probable sleep bruxism. However, the studies conducted in individuals with definite sleep bruxism failed to demonstrate any association. With more reliable measures to evaluate sleep bruxism, a relationship between sleep bruxism and sleep quality was not evident.",
