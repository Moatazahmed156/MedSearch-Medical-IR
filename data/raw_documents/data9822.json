  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the diurnal blood pressure (BP) profile, progression of CKD, and hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) in patients with CKD stages 1-3 during a 6-month observation period. Eighty-seven patients with CKD stages 1-3 underwent 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), echocardiography, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessment, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement at baseline and after 6 months. Serum creatinine and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated using the CKD-EPI formula. Based on ABPM, patients were classified as dippers/extreme dippers (D/ED, 35.6%), non-dippers (ND, 47.2%), and reverse dippers (RD, 17.2%). At follow-up, the RD group showed a significant decline in the eGFR and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to D/ED. IMT values were consistently higher in RD than in D/ED at baseline and follow-up. No significant differences in PWV were observed. An abnormal diurnal BP profile is common in patients with CKD stages 1-3. The \"reverse dipper\" profile is associated with faster CKD progression, more advanced vascular remodeling, and reduced left ventricular function. The results of our study support the role of ABPM as a useful tool in assessing risk in the early stages of CKD, providing additional prognostic information beyond office blood pressure measurements. The relatively small sample size, short follow-up period, lack of detailed data on treatment modifications, and absence of orthostatic BP assessment may limit the interpretation and generalizability of the results.",
