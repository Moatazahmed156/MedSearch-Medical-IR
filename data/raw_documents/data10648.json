  "abstract": "Understanding the prevalence and overlap of treatable traits in severe asthma and COPD can guide personalised management. We aimed to determine the prevalence of traits in severe asthma and COPD compared to healthy controls in a tertiary care setting and to compare prevalence by diagnostic label. Participants with severe asthma, COPD and healthy controls were recruited to a cross-sectional study and underwent multidimensional assessment to characterise their treatable traits. We recruited 140 participants with severe asthma, 45 COPD and 67 healthy controls, mean ± SD age, 56.6 ± 16.2 years, and 57.5 % female. Participants with severe asthma and controls, were younger compared to COPD p < 0.001. Of the 23 possible traits, fewer were identified in severe asthma (9.0 ± 2.8) and controls (2.4 ± 1.4) compared to COPD (10.6 ± 2.4; p < 0.001, with a difference between severe asthma and COPD; p < 0.001). Traits that were less prevalent in severe asthma were dyspnoea; p < 0.01, exertional O This study provides further support for the treatable traits approach, revealing both diverse and overlapping traits in severe asthma and COPD. This advances the treatable traits paradigm and supports its implementation to improve personalised care in severe asthma and COPD.",
