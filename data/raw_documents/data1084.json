    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which targets regulatory pathways in T cells to enhance antitumor immune responses, improves the life quality of cancer patients and has joined the ranks of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy to become a major choice for cancer therapy. Over the past few years, multiple exciting results have been obtained on checkpoint inhibitor therapy in advanced head and neck cancer. However, questions such as patient selection and biomarkers for assessing the therapy are largely unsolved. Herein, we briefly review recent findings in checkpoint inhibitor therapy for advanced head and neck cancer. We will also discuss possible mechanism, safety, combination therapy, and side effects for the therapy. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has led to important clinical advances and will provide a new weapon against cancer.",
