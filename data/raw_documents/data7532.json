    "abstract": "There is a general consensus that breast cancer is a rising trend disease in the world. It is one of the most common cancer types and is the leading cause of death among women's cancers. There are several reasons for this high rate of mortality including metastasis which is responsible for about 90 % of cancer-related mortality. Therefore, recognition and understanding of metastatic process is important, and by considering the key role of pathophysiological route in metastasis as a multistep cascade of \"invasion-metastasis,\" it might modify and improve our insight toward this complex phenomenon. Moreover, it can provide novel approaches for designing advanced targeted therapies. The present work aimed to review the published papers regarding molecular basis of metastatic process of breast cancer to brain metastasis, especially related genes and signaling network. Furthermore, the use of molecular aspects of metastatic breast cancer to brain was discussed in horizon of future treatment of breast cancer.",
