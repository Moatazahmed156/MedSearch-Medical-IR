    "abstract": "In juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), imaging is increasingly used in clinical practice. In this paper we discuss imaging of the knee, the clinically most commonly affected joint in JIA. In the last decade, a number of important steps have been made in the development of imaging outcome measures in children with JIA knee involvement. Ultrasound is undergoing a fast validation process, which should be accomplished within the next few years. The validation processes of MRI as an imaging biomarker for clinical trials in the JIA knee are at an advanced stage, with important data available on the feasibility, reliability and validity of the Juvenile Arthritis MRI Scoring system. Moreover, both US and MRI data are emerging on the normal appearance of the growing knee joint.",
