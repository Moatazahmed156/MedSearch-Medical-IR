  "title": "Designing a Novel Multi-Epitope Trivalent Vaccine Against NDV, AIV and FAdV-4 Based on Immunoinformatics Approaches.",
  "abstract": "The diseases caused by genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV), H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), and fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) continue to threaten the global poultry industry. However, no broad-spectrum vaccines provide simultaneous protection against these three pathogens. This study employed bioinformatics and immunoinformatics approaches to design a multi-epitope vaccine, named NFAF, which consists of B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes derived from hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins of genotype VII NDV, hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H9N2, and Fiber2 protein of FAdV-4. The vaccine candidate was predicted to have non-allergenic properties, non-toxicity, high antigenicity, and favorable solubility. Each of its constituent antigenic epitopes has a high degree of conservation. Molecular docking demonstrated stable binding between NFAF and chicken Toll-like receptor (TLRs) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. NFAF was expressed in soluble form in ",
