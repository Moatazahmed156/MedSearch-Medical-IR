  "title": "Screening for Diabetes after Solid Organ Transplantation: A 10-Year Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common and important complication after solid organ transplantation, affecting long-term outcomes. Graft rejection, decreased patient survival, infections and increased cardiovascular risk are associated with PTDM and may arise from both transplant-related and traditional risk factors. Early screening for PTDM is crucial for early detection and management. Despite clinical guidelines recommending regular screening for PTDM, screening rates remain suboptimal. This retrospective study analyzes PTDM screening rates between January 2014-January 2024 among pediatric kidney, liver, heart and lung transplant recipients at a large quaternary academic pediatric transplant center. PTDM screening rates vary by organ type, with kidney transplant patients at 19.4%, liver transplant patients at 14.6%, heart transplant patients at 34.3% and lung transplant patients at 91.7%. These lower-than-expected rates of PTDM screening among high risk pediatric- kidney, liver and heart transplant pediatric population highlight the need for improved screening protocols and provider education post-transplantation.",
