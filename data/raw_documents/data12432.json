  "title": "Clear cell sarcoma like tumor of the rectum: A rare entity.",
  "abstract": "Clear Cell Sarcoma-like tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (CCSGT) are extremely rare entities to be diagnosed and treated. Histopathological diagnosis and treatment of such rare malignancies is a challenge. This case report describes the treatment of a non-metastatic rectal CCSGT. The patient underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) followed by adjuvant radiation to a dose of 60Gy over 30 fractions over 6 weeks. This report represents the first documented case of a localized clear cell sarcoma-like tumor of the rectum successfully treated with adjuvant radiation therapy, highlighting the potential role of radiotherapy in managing this rare malignancy.",
