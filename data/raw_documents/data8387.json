    "abstract": "Drug discovery in universities is usually associated with research on drug targets and mechanisms, but more recently there have been efforts to progress from target studies to proof of concept by applying commercially focussed medicinal chemistry. This creates more opportunities for novel interactions and partnering models between academic groups and pharmaceutical companies. We present a review of coordinated, multi-institutional drug discovery operations within academia that are engaging with industry nationally and internationally and describe how the Drug Discovery Portal at the University of Strathclyde enhances the possibilities for academic drug discovery.",
