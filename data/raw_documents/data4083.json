    "abstract": "Palliative radiotherapy for symptomatic and intact breast tumors must balance convenience, efficacy, and risk of acute toxicity. This case report presents a patient with metastatic breast cancer and an intact fungating primary tumor. She was treated with an ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy, 26 Gy in 5 consecutive daily fractions, with sequential palliative chemotherapy. This resulted in a minimal toxicity profile and significant reduction of tumor burden and symptoms.",
