    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to investigate prevalences of head and neck cancers in patients with and those without Sjögren's syndrome using a population-based dataset.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We retrieved sampled patients from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. This study included 38 930 patients with Sjögren's syndrome and 155 720 propensity-score matched comparison patients without Sjögren's syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Chi-squared tests revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalences of head and neck cancers between patients with Sjögren's syndrome and comparison patients (1.77% vs. 1.22%, p < 0.001). The odds ratio for head and neck cancers for patients with Sjögren's syndrome relative to the comparison group was 1.452 (95% CI = 1.325-1.592).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study demonstrated that patients with Sjögren's syndrome face increased odds of head and neck cancers, encompassing several sites including the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and thyroid.",
