  "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) often overlap and may amplify cardiovascular risk. Whether renal dysfunction should be incorporated into composite cardiovascular endpoints in AF remains uncertain. We aimed to quantify AF-associated risk of MACE and evaluate the incremental prognostic value of kidney measures (eGFR and albuminuria) to inform composite outcomes and clinical management. We performed a retrospective, community-based cohort study of 40,297 adults aged 65-95 years. Individuals with incident AF ( Incident AF was associated with higher risk of MACE (HR 3.52), CKD (HR 1.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.14). CKD was nearly twice more frequent in AF than in non-AF (30.9% vs. 14.5%;  Newly diagnosed AF confers a substantial excess risk of MACE and its components. The consistent eGFR and albuminuria in AF support considering clinically meaningful renal endpoints within composite outcomes and prioritizing integrated cardiorenal management. These findings provide actionable evidence to refine risk stratification and endpoint selection in AF research and care.",
