  "title": "Interconnected Organs: Exploring the Impact of Kidney-Lung Crosstalk in Critically Ill Neonates and Children.",
  "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute lung injury (ALI) are common in critically ill neonates, children, and those with severe cardiac disease. Although kidney and lung dysfunction can occur independently, molecular signaling and organ crosstalk significantly influence the function of each organ. Additionally, there is a link between AKI and fluid balance disorders. A bidirectional and synergistic relationship exists between AKI and fluid imbalance, with fluid management potentially becoming compromised before or after AKI. Fluid accumulation can further worsen ALI by impairing gas exchange. Organ crosstalk involves both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as other modulating factors. Both AKI and ALI have harmful effects in pediatric patients, and AKI can lead to long-term consequences, especially in premature neonates, who are at much higher risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease following AKI. Unfortunately, supportive treatments for ALI, such as positive pressure ventilation, can increase right ventricular afterload and central venous pressure, which may worsen renal perfusion, creating a cycle of ongoing multiple organ dysfunction. Pediatric research has provided insights into potential treatment strategies for preventing ALI, even without AKI. Prophylactic peritoneal dialysis may help remove pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to AKI and ALI in children undergoing cardiac surgery. Future studies are necessary to explore interventions that can prevent or reduce the harmful effects of kidney and lung injuries in critically ill children.",
