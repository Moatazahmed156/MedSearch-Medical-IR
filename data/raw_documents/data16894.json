  "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common comorbidity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Many patients with epilepsy as well as ASD experience disruptions in their sleep-wake cycle and daily fluctuations in symptom severity. Chronic exposure to light at nighttime can disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Contactin associated protein-like 2 knockout ( Male and female  DLaN exposure delayed wake onset and disrupted sleep patterns in a sex-dependent manner, with females being more affected. DLaN significantly increased slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5–4 Hz) in both WT and KO mice, consistent with increased sleep pressure. Notably, DLaN markedly elevated the frequency of abnormal hypersynchronized EEG events in  Chronic DLaN exposure disrupts sleep architecture in a sex-dependent fashion and increases the occurrence of abnormal EEG events in  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13229-025-00689-7.",
