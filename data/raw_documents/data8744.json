    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made during the past decade in corrective gene therapy of the skin. This includes advances in vector technology, targeted gene expression, gene replacement, gene correction, and the availability of appropriate animal models for a variety of candidate diseases. While non-viral integration of large genes such as essential basement membrane proteins has been mastered, new challenges such as the control of immune responses lie ahead of the research community. Among the first skin diseases, patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) will enter clinical trials.",
