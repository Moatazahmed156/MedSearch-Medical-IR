  "title": "The association between internal and external measures of training load in elite rowers during ergometer training.",
  "abstract": "While traditional rowing metrics such as stroke rate and split times offer basic performance feedback, they do not fully reflect individual physiological responses, and the relationship between external and internal training loads remains inadequately characterized in rowing ergometer training. This study systematically investigated the correlations between two key internal load measures-training impulse (TRIMP) and session rating of perceived exertion training load (sRPE",
