    "abstract": "The study of mechanical properties of tissues can be considered as biomarkers for early detection of cancer and help in new treatments. In this study, the Young's modulus of MCF-7 breast cancer tissue was extracted using atomic force microscopy (AFM) by measuring the interaction force of the sample and performing a simulation. The force-indentation depth diagram was plotted by averaging the experimental results. In this paper, the modulus of elasticity of breast cancer tissue has been extracted with complex models such as DMT, MD, BCP, and SUN. By comparing the experimental and theoretical results and by changing the amount of hypothetical Young's modulus in the spherical contact models, the Young's modulus of the cancer tissue is considered to be between 300 and 400 Pa. The geometry of the cell was also assumed to be spherical according to the images obtained by atomic force microscopy.",
