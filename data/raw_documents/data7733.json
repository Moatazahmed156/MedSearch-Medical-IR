    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To summarize the issues pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients face during and after a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and guide appropriate nursing care for patients with ALL in these young age groups.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Peer-reviewed journal articles, published guidelines, patient and family resources, and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Nursing care of children, adolescents, and young adults with ALL requires a comprehensive approach that is appropriate for the developmental needs of patients in this age group.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for nursing practice:\n        \n      \n      Oncology nurses must be aware of the unique developmental challenges that pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients face while dealing with a diagnosis of ALL, and have knowledge of resources available for these patients to effectively guide them through treatment and its side effects, fertility options, psychosocial challenges, and survivorship.",
