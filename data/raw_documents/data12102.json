  "abstract": "The RAS family of oncoproteins (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) drive aggressive cancers like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet targeting mutant RAS has historically been challenging due to its \"undruggable\" structure. Recent advances in mutation-specific inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib for KRAS",
