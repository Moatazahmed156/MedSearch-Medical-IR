  "title": "High Prevalence of Smoking-Related Diseases in High-Grade and Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Opportunities for Lung Cancer Screening.",
  "abstract": "Bladder carcinoma (BC) is strongly associated with tobacco exposure, a major shared risk factor for several smoking-related diseases (SRDs), including pulmonary disorders and coronary atherosclerosis. However, the prevalence of SRDs in patients with high-grade (HGBC) or muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC) has not been systematically investigated. We aimed to evaluate SRD prevalence and to assess the potential role of chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in a population with histologically confirmed HGBC or MIBC. We retrospectively analyzed 166 patients with histologically confirmed HGBC/MIBC who underwent staging HRCT. SRDs-including emphysema, suspicious pulmonary nodules, airway disease, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and coronary artery calcifications (CAC)-were assessed. Associations between smoking status and SRDs were evaluated using binary logistic regression, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Overall, 60.2% of patients had at least one SRD. Smokers showed a significantly higher SRD prevalence than non-smokers ( Patients with HGBC/MIBC demonstrate a high prevalence of SRDs, supporting the integration of chest HRCT into staging protocols. HRCT may enable early detection of clinically relevant comorbidities and help identify candidates for lung cancer screening.",
