  "title": "Tau proteoforms as plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease: mechanisms, measurement, and Medicine.",
  "abstract": "Blood-based tau proteoforms have emerged as specific, scalable biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology, addressing the limitations of symptom-based diagnosis, neuroimaging, and invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. This review synthesizes advances in tau phosphorylation and truncation biology, evaluates translation from CSF to plasma with state-of-the-art proteomics, and outlines the analytical standards and cross-matrix calibration needed for clinical adoption. We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar. We reviewed studies published between January 2005 and September 2025 investigating tau proteoforms in Alzheimer's disease. Blood-based tau proteoforms are poised to move Alzheimer's diagnostics from specialized imaging to accessible frontline testing, with plasma p-tau217 approaching positron emission tomography (PET) and CSF performance and multi-analyte panels with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or neurofilament light (NfL) improving differential diagnosis while reducing invasiveness and cost. Building on the first FDA-cleared plasma assay(Lumipulse G p-tau217/Aβ1-42 Ratio) in May 2025, we anticipate a dual pathway over the next decade in which referral centers use high-plex mass spectrometry(MS) panels for phosphoforms and truncations, while primary care adopts automated high-throughput immunoassays (e.g Chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA)) for triage, supported by harmonized Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), cross-matrix calibration, and robust reference materials.",
