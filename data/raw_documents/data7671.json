    "abstract": "Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of blunt native kidney injuries. Transplanted kidneys are more exposed to such injuries due to the common positioning in the iliac fossa compared with the relatively protected position of the native kidneys. The small number of cases identified in the literature describe grade II and III transplant kidney injuries that were treated surgically. In our case a grade IV injury was managed conservatively giving the necessary time to appropriately plan the future renal replacement therapy options for the patient.",
