Patients usually show erythematous hyperkeratosis with yellowish, adherent scales on the hands and feet or other acral locations such as ears or nose. We herein report a case of Bazex syndrome in a male patient, who was previously diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. Our case report highlights this rare condition as early diagnosis may impact the patient's course of tumor disease and prognosis.",
