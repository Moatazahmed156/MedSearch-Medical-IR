    "abstract": "An incomplete understanding of the pathological processes involved in neurodegeneration and dysfunction of spinal cord injuries and diseases makes these disorders difficult to treat. Repair of damaged or genetically impaired spinal cord also has been limited by the complexity, cellular heterogeneity, and relative inaccessibility of the tissue. Thus, therapeutic options for the treatment of either chronic spinal cord diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or acute spinal cord injuries have been rather limited. Potential new therapeutic targets are being identified as our understanding of the molecular pathology involved in neural injury and regeneration increases. Recent advances in gene transfer techniques have made gene therapy a more realistic and viable strategy for the treatment of a broad range of spinal cord disorders. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the limitations and recent advances in gene therapy and potential application of this technology toward spinal cord injury and disease.",
