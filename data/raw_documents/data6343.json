    "abstract": "The echogenic structures of 1983 transrectal sonographies of the prostate were analysed. In addition, 93 dissected prostates were investigated in waterbath in order to correlate sonographic and morphological structures. Compared to the normal gland, hyperplastic nodules are of the same density or slightly echodenser, rarely also with a poorer echo. In about 60% the inner gland can be delineated. Although 52% of the carcinomas show the same echodensity as diffuse hyperplasia, diagnosis is still possible by further criteria. In only 13% no carcinomas were detectable. 18% of the carcinomas were differentiated by poor echogenicity. The diagnostic value is discussed.",
