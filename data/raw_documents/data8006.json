    "abstract": "Brain tumours are a heterogenic group, a subtype of which is arising from glial cells. Pediatric low-grade gliomas are the most common primary CNS tumour group in childhood, representing 25% to over 30% of pediatric CNS tumours. Pediatric high-grade gliomas are relatively rare and have a poor prognosis. Epidemiological studies have reported various potential risk factors, such as demographics, ionizing and nonionizing radiation, allergic conditions, and infections, immunologic, parental, genetic, and developmental risk factors. These risk factors are relatively unclear and understudied; thus, this narrative review aims to summarize all studies connecting risk factors and pediatric gliomas.",
