    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death and the second most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Surgical intervention is most applicable to early-stage lung cancer diagnoses and considered the best curative option. Multiple surgical techniques are now available, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy. Robotics and video-assistance are commonly used in wedge resection and sometimes used for segmentectomy. Regardless of the technique, focused clinical management of the patient following lung cancer surgery by nurses and nurse practitioners remains a priority. Future innovations affecting the surgical treatment of lung cancer include immunotherapy and oncogenomics.",
