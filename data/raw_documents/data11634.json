We sought to: validate right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV 3DE RV and left ventricular (LV) SV were collected simultaneously with direct Fick measurements at right heart catheterization (RVSV The feasibility of RVSV RVSV measured by 3DE is accurate (minimal bias, acceptable imprecision) when compared to direct Fick RVSV",
