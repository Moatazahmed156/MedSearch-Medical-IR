    "abstract": "Lung resection remains the therapy of choice offering the greatest potential for cure in non spread lung cancer. As these procedures have a significant rate of cardiopulmonary complications, risk assessment and evaluation of functional operability is essential for successful resectional surgery. The most valuable parameters for evaluation of lung function and risk assessment are FEV1, DLCO and VO2max as well as the calculation of predicted postoperative lung function. With preoperative preparatory physical therapy and treatment of comorbidities, also marginal patients may become operable for resectional surgery.",
