    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury remains a devastating neurological condition with limited therapeutic opportunities. Since decompressive surgery and high-dose methylprednisolone have limited utility for most patients, spinal cord injury clearly represents a major medical challenge. Experimental evidence has suggested that secondary cellular injury processes may be a realistic target for therapeutic intervention with the goal of inhibiting the progression of detrimental changes that normally follows traumatic injury to the cord. Preventing or reducing this delayed cellular injury may alone improve neurological recovery or facilitate future regenerative approaches to the injured cord. This review summarises recent advances in the development of pharmacological agents targeting the acute phase of spinal cord injury as well as potential strategies to facilitate regeneration of the spinal cord.",
