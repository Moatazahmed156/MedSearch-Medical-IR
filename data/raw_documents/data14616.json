  "title": "Mulberry-derived carbon dots attenuate kidney fibrosis through direct inhibition of PI3K.",
  "abstract": "Kidney fibrosis is a progressive pathological process underlying chronic kidney disease, yet effective anti-fibrotic therapeutics remain scarce. Here, we developed fluorescent carbon dots derived from mulberry (M-CDs) via a facile hydrothermal method as a novel nanotherapeutic agent against kidney fibrosis. The obtained M-CDs exhibited excellent water dispersibility, high quantum yield, and outstanding fluorescence stability across broad pH and ionic strength conditions. ",
