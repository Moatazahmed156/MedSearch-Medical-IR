    "abstract": "Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (CMZL) is one of the major primary B-cell lymphomas of skin. Two types are recognized: a more common class-chain switched CMZL, and a much less common IgM+ CMZL. The extremely indolent course, together with other features distinct from most other MALT lymphomas, has led some to question whether at least the class-switched cases should be considered an overt lymphoma.",
