    "abstract": "The priming of a T cell results from its physical interaction with a dendritic cell (DC) that presents the cognate antigenic peptide. The success rate of such interactions is extremely low, because the precursor frequency of a naive T cell recognizing a specific antigen is in the range of 1:10(5)-10(6). To make this principle practicable, encounter frequencies between DCs and T cells are maximized within lymph nodes (LNs) that are compact immunological projections of the peripheral tissue they drain. But LNs are more than passive meeting places for DCs that immigrated from the tissue and lymphocytes that recirculated via the blood. The microanatomy of the LN stroma actively organizes the cellular encounters by providing preformed migration tracks that create dynamic but highly ordered movement patterns. LN architecture further acts as a sophisticated filtration system that sieves the incoming interstitial fluid at different levels and guarantees that immunologically relevant antigens are loaded on DCs or B cells while inert substances are channeled back into the blood circulation. This review focuses on the non-hematopoietic infrastructure of the lymph node. We describe the association between fibroblastic reticular cell, conduit, DC, and T cell as the essential functional unit of the T-cell cortex.",
