  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that involves many interlinking pathways and genetic elements that remain to be fully understood and characterised. Non-coding genetic elements have long been overlooked, however recent advancements in the field have highlighted their importance with an area of interest being transposable elements. SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) elements are the youngest and smallest subset of retrotransposons that are only found within hominid species. SVAs have been shown to have strong regulatory impacts within our genome and can affect progression of neurodegenerative disease such as PD. Previous studies identified an SVA, polymorphic for its presence/absence, that was associated with changes in gene expression at the ",
