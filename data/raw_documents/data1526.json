    "abstract": "Pediatric heart failure (PHF) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Whereas ischemic heart disease is the most important cause of heart failure in adults, congenital heart diseases (CHD) and cardiomyopathies are important etiologies of PHF. Management of PHF also differs from that of adults. Here authors have reviewed the literature on PHF with respect to etiology, symptoms, investigations and treatment strategies.",
