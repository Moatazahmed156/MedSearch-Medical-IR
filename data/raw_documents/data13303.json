  "title": "From Awareness to Understanding: A Knowledge-Focused Framework for Parkinson's Disease Communication.",
  "abstract": "The 2024 passage of the National Plan to End Parkinson's Act promises federal coordination and resources, creating a pivotal moment to sharpen public communication. Building on this opportunity means addressing unique challenges associated with Parkinson's disease, including the subtle and complex nature of symptoms, a public image dominated by a \"tremor-only, older white male\" stereotype, and uneven access to specialty care. These factors complicate early detection, stigma reduction, and equitable service use. Drawing on stigma research and communication science, this commentary reviews recent Parkinson's communication initiatives and their evaluation methods, highlighting common strengths and gaps. We synthesize these insights into a concise, practice-oriented checklist for campaign planners, linking actionable facts to clear next steps, balancing information with efficacy cues, and embedding navigation supports. While centered on Parkinson's, the principles outlined here could potentially apply to other chronic and neurodegenerative diseases where stigma and inequities delay diagnosis and treatment.",
