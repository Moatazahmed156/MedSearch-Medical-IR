    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common in the elderly. A primary sleep disorder can result from the physiological decline of aging; however, secondary sleep problems result from various causes involving physical and mental health. Since little is known about the relationships between sleep quality and mental health in aging, the present study aims to understand how different aspects generally associated with sleep (e.g., psychological and physiological factors, and sleep medication) may predict poor sleep quality in different stages of the lifespan. Therefore, we conducted several analyses (ANOVAs, Pearson correlations, and linear regressions) to test the hypotheses of the study. Accordingly, from a pool of 180 participants (elderly, middle-aged, and young adults), 143 individuals with poor sleep quality were selected. Different predictive patterns in the three groups emerged. Specifically, the use of sleep medication associated with worse sleep conditions is predicted by poor sleep quality in the elderly and by depression in young adults. In contrast, worsening sleep quality is predicted by depression in middle-aged adults. Previous studies focused on the transitions from good to poor sleep quality, while this is the first study to have examined the features of poor sleep quality in aging, highlighting different sleep patterns across the lifespan. This evidence should be considered from a preventive perspective.",
