  "title": "Functional Assessment of Genetically Modified Infrapatellar Fat Pad Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs): Potential Implications for Inflammation/Pain Reversal in Osteoarthritis.",
  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating joint disease affecting over 500 million people globally, characterized by cartilage degradation, chronic pain, and failed tissue repair. Neurogenic inflammation, driven by neuropeptides including Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OA. This study explores the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from infrapatellar fat pad mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (IFP-MSCs) transduced with CGRP antagonist CGRP",
