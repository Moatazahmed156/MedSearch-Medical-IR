    "abstract": "Body fluid volume regulation by the kidney relies upon the complex interaction of numerous factors. However, in edematous disorders, extrarenal factors can override the 'innate wisdom' of the kidney. For example, in patients with cardiac failure or liver disease and in pregnant women, the normal kidney continues to retain sodium and water despite expanded blood, plasma and extracellular fluid volumes. Such fluid retention can ultimately lead to pulmonary congestion, ascites or peripheral edema. Understanding the kidney's modulation of total body sodium and water in these patients has been perplexing. Cardiac output cannot provide the sole afferent signal for the kidney to regulate sodium and water balance, as the normal kidney can retain excessive amounts of sodium and water when cardiac output is low (e.g. in low output cardiac failure) or high (e.g. cirrhosis or pregnancy). Therefore the integrity of the arterial circulation, which can be impaired either by a low cardiac output or arterial vasodilation, is an important factor in body fluid composition and volume regulation in health and disease.",
