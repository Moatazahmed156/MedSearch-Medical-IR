  "title": "Qualitative Content Analysis of COVID-19's Role in Suicide Attempts Leading to Hospital Care.",
  "abstract": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide risk has been documented during the acute phase, but less is known about people who attempted suicide during the post-acute period. This study investigates how adults who attempted suicide during the post-acute pandemic period (2021-2023) understood COVID-19's role in their attempt. We analyzed interview data from 329 adults (59% female; 41% male), enrolled following a recent suicide attempt between 2021 and 2023. Participants were asked about the general impact of COVID-19 on their lives and then specifically about whether stress related to COVID-19 was a primary reason for their attempt or contributed to their suicidal thoughts. When asked about their recent attempt, 11% of participants identified stress related to COVID-19 as the primary reason for their attempt, and an additional 23% indicated it contributed to their suicidal thoughts. When describing general impacts, participants reported effects across multiple domains: social isolation, physical health concerns, mental health impacts, and economic effects. The attribution of suicide attempts to COVID-19-related stress during the post-acute period highlights the extended impact of public health crises on vulnerable individuals. These findings emphasize the need for sustained, integrated medical and mental healthcare following such crises.",
