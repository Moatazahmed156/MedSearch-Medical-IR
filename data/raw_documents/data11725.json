  "title": "Clinical-Genomic Risk Discordance in Early HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer: A Real-World Cohort from Japan Demonstrates Treatment Impact of Oncotype DX.",
  "abstract": "The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is widely implemented to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in early hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2- breast cancer. However, discordance between RS and conventional clinicopathological risk assessment (clinical risk, CR) remains a significant clinical challenge, particularly in real-world practice. We retrospectively analyzed 216 consecutive patients with early HR+/HER2- breast cancer who underwent Oncotype DX testing at Osaka Metropolitan University Hospital. CR was defined according to the St. Gallen criteria, and patients were categorized into four groups: RS-low/CR-low, RS-high/CR-high, RS-low/CR-high, and RS-high/CR-low. The concordance/discordance between RS and CR, their associations with clinicopathological features, and the impact on adjuvant chemotherapy decisions were evaluated. Concordance was observed in 122 patients (56.5%), consisting of 93 (43.1%) with RS-low/CR-low and 29 (13.4%) with RS-high/CR-high. Discordance was found in 94 patients (43.5%), including 90 (41.7%) with RS-low/CR-high and 4 (1.8%) with RS-high/CR-low. Compared with RS-low, RS-high patients more often had tumors >2 cm (57.1%  Clinical-genomic discordance was common. RS reflected tumor biology rather than nodal status, and chemotherapy use depended more on genomic-clinical concordance than CR alone. Integration of clinical and genomic risk is essential for optimizing adjuvant strategies in early HR+/HER2- breast cancer.",
