  "title": "Long non-coding RNA THAP7-AS1 interacts with EIF3A and enhances ITPR1 to enhance endoplasmic reticulum stress and endothelial cell pyroptosis in ischemic stroke.",
  "abstract": "THAP7-AS1 is a newly discovered long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) whose biological roles in human physiological and pathological processes remain elusive. This study explores the functional impacts of THAP7-AS1 and its interacting molecular cascades in human umbilical vein endothelial cell damage in the context of ischemic stroke. We observed that THAP7-AS1 interacted with EIF3A in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through a combination of RNA-IP, pull-down assays, and immunofluorescence staining assays. Knockdown of either THAP7-AS1 or EIF3A led to a significant reduction in ITPR1 expression, a key regulator of Ca",
