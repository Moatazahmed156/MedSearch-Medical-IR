    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To explore the similarities and differences in the needs of young adults with T1D during life transitions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data obtained for this paper was based on three qualitative studies carried out in Denmark and Australia. In total, 33 Individual interviews and two focus groups (n = 46) were conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The most pertinent themes related to the importance of support from peers with diabetes and healthcare professionals to help young adults adjust to independent living. The main difference experienced by Australian and Danish young adults related to the willingness and barriers in clinical attendance during this transitional period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical care for young adults with diabetes can be better adapted to support this population as they transition through significant milestones by engagement on the young adults' terms and encouraging young adults to seek out peer support. It is vital that clinical care is tailored to support them in order to ensure the best transition into adulthood with diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Practice implications:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians need to adopt a person-centred approach when engaging with young adults with diabetes. Considerations need to be made around external factors related to life events in young adulthood that may influence diabetes care.",
