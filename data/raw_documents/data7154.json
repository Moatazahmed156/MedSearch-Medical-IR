    "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) has become one of the greatest public health problems. The differentiation between specific and non-specific low back pain is mandatory. In the specific low back pain are classified all diseases whose etiology is well defined, quick and accurate diagnosis is required for specific treatment. Other types of low back pain can be considered non-specific. The management of acute low back pain is mainly based on analgesic treatment and early mobilization. Maintaining activity can prevent chronicity of LBP. Chronicity factors are multiple, mainly psycho-social and professional. The chronic low back pain treatment goals are the reduction of pain and better activity/participation to achieve the prevention of disability and maintaining work ability. Multidisciplinary treatment programs including personalized and guided physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and short-term training programs will help to improve, restore and maintain the function in chronic low back pain.",
