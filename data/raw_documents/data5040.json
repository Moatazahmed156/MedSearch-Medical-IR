    "abstract": "Ruminococcus, as a pivotal member of the gut microbiota, exhibits dual roles in the pathogenesis, progression, and treatment of prostate cancer (particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC) through its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and androgen steroids. This review highlights that Ruminococcus modulates prostate cancer development and therapy by metabolizing androgen precursors, secreting SCFAs, and influencing immune checkpoints. The findings provide reference data on the impact of Ruminococcus on prostate cancer and further propose novel therapeutic strategies, such as dietary interventions and microbiota modulation, to enhance treatment efficacy. Key mechanisms involve Ruminococcus-mediated reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling post-androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), SCFA-induced autophagy and NF-κB/MAPK pathway activation, and strain-specific effects (e.g., R. gnavus associated with poor prognosis versus R. torques linked to improved CAR-T outcomes). These insights underscore the potential of targeting the gut-prostate axis for advancing precision oncology in CRPC management.",
