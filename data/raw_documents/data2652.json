    "abstract": "Urinary tract complications such as urinary tract infection, ureteral reflux, upper tract dilatation and incontinence are common with myelomeningocele. Regular urological evaluations, including measurement of residual urine, uranalysis, urine culture, voiding cystourethrogram, excretory urogram and renal function studies, are essential for the diagnosis and management of such complications. Conservative therapy with Crede bladder expression and urethral catheter drainage has been unsuccessful in managing these complications and preventing upper tract deterioration.",
