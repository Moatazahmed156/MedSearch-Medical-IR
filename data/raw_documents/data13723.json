We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with PG between 2000 and 2024 at Dr. Balmis General University Hospital (Spain). Thirty-two patients were included (24 women, 8 men), with a median age of 41 years (men: 61; women: 41;  Ulcerative PG was the most prevalent form, typically affecting the lower limbs. Inflammatory and autoimmune comorbidities were frequent. Most patients required systemic therapy, and disease control was often prolonged. The mortality was higher, and age was the main predictor.",
