    "abstract": "Based on the measurement of simple physiological parameters urodynamic testing can reproduce clinical symptoms in a quantitative way, associates changes in physiological parameters to pathophysiological conditions and helps to establish a diagnosis in numerous lower urinary tract dysfunctions. Furthermore, urodynamic testing allows lower urinary tract dysfunctions to be classified as storage failure, voiding failure or combined storage and voiding failure. Therapeutic decision-making is based on this classification.",
