    "abstract": "Temporal relation of myocardial infarction with cocaine use was first reported in 1982, coronary spasm being the presumed aetiology since most patients presented with normal coronary arteries. However, severe and diffused coronary atherosclerosis is also common in cocaine users with myocardial infarction. The management of these patients presenting with chest pain includes therapy directed to antagonize sympathetic activation and mechanical reperfusion or thrombolytic therapy if ischaemia continues.",
