  "abstract": "Thrombotic risk stratification in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients is an unmet need. CAD patients show increased platelet activation, but its prognostic relevance remains unexplored. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of platelet-activation markers on mortality in CAD patients.Surface expression of platelet-associated activated GPIIbIIIa, P-selectin, tissue factor (TF), and platelet-leukocyte aggregate was analyzed in 527 CAD patients (acute coronary syndromes [ACS, ",
