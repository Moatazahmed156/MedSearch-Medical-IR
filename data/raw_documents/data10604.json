  "title": "Recent Developments in Monoclonal-Antibody-Based Biologic Therapy for Severe Refractory Eosinophilic Asthma.",
  "abstract": "Asthma exhibits marked heterogeneity both clinically and at the molecular phenotypic level, requiring specifically targeted treatments to block the key pathways of the disease. Monoclonal-antibody-based biologics targeted at critical inflammatory pathways of T2 inflammation such as IL-5, IL-5R, IL-4, and IL-13 are increasingly regarded as effective treatments for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. This review provides an update on the potential of straightforward and reproducible biomarkers to aid in the selection of the biologic-based therapy most likely to be effective in patients with severe or refractory eosinophilic asthma based on English-language original articles in PubMed or MedLine. Monoclonal-antibody-based biologic therapies have revolutionised severe asthma management, enabling reductions in symptoms that include exacerbations, discontinuation of oral corticosteroids, improved lung function, and enhanced quality of life. Significant clinical effects with anti-IL-5 or -IL-4/13 monoclonal antibodies are more likely to be seen when simple predictive biomarkers such as serum periostin, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), or blood eosinophil counts are used to aid in the identification of those patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma who are most likely to benefit from biologic therapies. Biologic-based therapy aimed at T2 inflammation benefits patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, particularly when guided by biomarkers that do not require direct sampling of the airways to target therapy, who are most likely to benefit from these treatments, with good safety profiles for these therapies.",
