    "abstract": "Much interest has been directed towards stem cells, both in basic and translational research, to understand basic stem cell biology and to develop new therapies for many disorders. In general, stem cells can be cultured with relative ease, however, most common culture methods for stem cells employ 2D techniques using plastic. These cultures do not well represent the stem cell niches in the body, which are delicate microenvironments composed of not only stem cells, but also supporting stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and growth factors. Therefore, researchers and clinicians have been seeking optimal stem cell preparations for basic research and clinical applications, and these might be attainable through 3D culture of stem cells. The 3D cultures recapitulate the in vivo cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions more effectively, and the cells in 3D cultures exhibit many unique and desirable characteristics. The culture of stem cells in 3D may employ various matrices or scaffolds, in addition to the cells, to support the complex structures. The goal of this Special Issue is to bring together recent research on 3D cultures of various stem cells to increase the basic understanding of stem cells and culture techniques, and also highlight stem cell preparations for possible novel therapeutic applications.",
