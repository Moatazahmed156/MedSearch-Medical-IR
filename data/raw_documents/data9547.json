  "title": "Comprehensive management of infectious cellulitis: from epidemiology to hospital approach in Spain.",
  "abstract": "Cellulitis is a skin and soft tissue infection caused by the entry of a microorganism into the subcutaneous tissue. Nowadays it represents one of the main causes of hospital admission, mainly due to incorrect diagnosis or the need for intravenous treatment. The aim of this study is to observe the characteristics of cellulitis in patients admitted to our hospital during two years in order to determine whether admissions were really necessary. Retrospective study of admissions for cellulitis between 2022 and 2023 at the Salamanca University Hospital, classified according to the CREST-SEWS criteria. During the study period, 332 patients with cellulitis were admitted to the Salamanca University Hospital. 56% of the patients were classified as grade II (those who do not have severe symptoms, but who are usually admitted due to their comorbidities). 70% of the patients had some comorbidity or risk factor such as skin disorders, type II diabetes mellitus or heart failure. The most common site of infection was the lower extremities. The etiologic agent of the infection could be established in 28% of the patients, and the most frequently isolated microorganism was methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. The most common treatment was β-lactams, specifically amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (39.5%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (23.8%). In order to treat infectious cellulitis, it is essential to carry out a correct etiological diagnosis in order to establish the most appropriate treatment and reduce unnecessary admissions, especially in patients with class II cellulitis.",
