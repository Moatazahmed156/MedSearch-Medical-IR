    "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infections and significantly reducing disease severity and mortality. We report on a novel COVID-19 antibody assay using a unique platform to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with a drop of fingerstick blood in a subject following COVID-19 vaccination. We show early detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post vaccination and persistence of detectable antibodies for at least 6 months. Rapid point of care COVID-19 antibody tests might have a role in assessing the appearance and durability of immune response following COVID-19 vaccination.",
