  "title": "Association between Diet Quality and Knee Osteoarthritis: Insights from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013.",
  "abstract": "The association between diet quality (DQ) and osteoarthritis (OA) among the Asian population is unclear. Even within this population, the associations between DQ and OA may differ by region. We examined the relationship between DQ and radiologic knee OA (RKOA) among Koreans, stratifying participants by residential area. This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2013. A total of 2,222 participants aged 50 years old and older with available data on RKOA and DQ were analyzed. DQ was evaluated using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI). RKOA was diagnosed via radiography and defined as having a Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2 in the knee. Participants were categorized by residential region: metropolitan cities, small to medium-sized cities, or rural areas. The odds ratios for RKOA across the three regions were analyzed using multiple logistic regression, adjusting for confounding factors. High KHEI scores were associated with lower odds of RKOA (P for trend=0.03). This association was primarily observed in residents of metropolitan cities, particularly among men (P for trend=0.02). Better DQ is associated with reduced odds of RKOA in older Korean adults living in metropolitan areas.",
