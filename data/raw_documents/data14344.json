  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common inflammatory degenerative disease that causes joint pain and irreversible bone damage, affecting many middle-aged and elderly people. Currently, there is no effective treatment available. Okara, a byproduct of soybean processing, contains bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties similar to those found in soybeans, making it a promising candidate for reuse as a food supplement to provide health benefits. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of soybean okara extract (SOE) in OA using a rat surgical anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) OA model. Oral administration of SOE significantly alleviated bone pain associated with ACLT, as demonstrated by a weight-bearing behavioral assay. Histopathological analysis revealed that oral SOE ameliorated ACLT-induced bone destruction, improved cartilage and synovium integrity, and reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and the chondrolytic enzyme MMP-3. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the degradation of aggrecan and collagen type II, thereby preserving cartilage. These findings suggest that oral administration of SOE could be a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of OA.",
