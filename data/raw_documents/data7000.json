This development has prompted the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) to issue a revised staging system that can provide prognostic information and guidance on personalized management of ovarian cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We review the epidemiology of ovarian cancer, the new FIGO staging system, and the role of imaging in the assessment, staging, and follow-up of ovarian cancer.",
