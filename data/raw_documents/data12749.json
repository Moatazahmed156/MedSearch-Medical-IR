  "title": "General Principles of Risk Mitigation before Colorectal Surgery.",
  "abstract": "Preoperative risk mitigation is vital for improving surgical outcomes and patient safety, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) surgeries. While traditional approaches have primarily focused on postoperative care, the preoperative period is a unique opportunity for intervention to enhance patients' physiological readiness for surgery and minimize complications. This narrative review examines the general principles of preoperative risk mitigation, identifies common complications in colorectal surgery, and explores the impact of patient comorbidities on surgical outcomes. Additionally, the review discusses the strategic management of modifiable risk factors. The integration and impact of prehabilitation protocols in colorectal surgery are also evaluated. Evidence indicates that addressing modifiable preoperative risk factors can significantly improve surgical outcomes. Obesity management, nutritional optimization, and enhancing functional capacity through prehabilitation have been shown to reduce postoperative complications. Multimodal prehabilitation benefits high-risk and frail patients, improving their postoperative recovery and reducing complication rates. The preoperative period is crucial for implementing risk mitigation strategies to enhance surgical outcomes in CRC patients. Interventions targeting modifiable risk factors and integrating prehabilitation protocols can complement traditional postoperative care, improving recovery and reducing complications. Despite promising findings, further research is necessary to fully understand the long-term benefits and optimize preoperative interventions to mitigate postoperative morbidities effectively.",
