    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Myopericytoma (MPC) is a rare perivascular tumor with myoid differentiation that poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the head and neck.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We present four cases of oral and sinonasal MPC and conducted a literature review to analyze clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and management.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-five published cases were identified, yielding a cohort of 69 patients. The oral cavity was the most common site (44.9%) followed by parotid (15.9%), sinonasal (10.1%), neck (10.1%), and other head regions (18.8%). Complete excision was achieved in 95.7% of cases with a 7.2% recurrence rate. Histopathology confirmed MPC in all cases with characteristic perivascular spindle cell proliferation, 95.6% showing positive smooth muscle actin immunostaining.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      MPC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of vascular head and neck lesions. Complete surgical excision with negative margins remains the treatment of choice, with immunohistochemistry essential for accurate diagnosis.",
