  "abstract": "Enavogliflozin is a recently developed novel sodium‒glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor that is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. During clinical development, a 0.3 mg daily dose regimen was effective at lowering the blood glucose level, whereas a 0.1 mg dose formulation was used in the early clinical phase. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of a low-strength formulation of 0.1 mg of enavogliflozin and two high-strength formulations of 0.3 mg of enavogliflozin. Two clinical trials designed as randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover studies were conducted in healthy Korean subjects. In Study A, the subjects received either three tablets of 0.1 mg enavogliflozin or one tablet of 0.3 mg enavogliflozin according to their assigned sequence. In Study B, the subjects received a single dose of 0.3 mg of enavogliflozin in one of two different formulations. Blood samples were collected for up to 72 h to assess the PK of enavogliflozin. The maximum concentration (C",
