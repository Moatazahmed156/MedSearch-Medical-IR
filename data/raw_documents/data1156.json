    "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to increase in many Asian countries, with possible contributing factors, such as younger-onset disease, diabetes development at lower body mass index, higher visceral fat accumulation and poorer β-cell function, among Asian populations. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been shown to confer favorable effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, such as improved glycemic control, weight and blood pressure reduction, and importantly, cardiorenal benefits. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated, and have a well-defined safety profile based on evidence from numerous clinical trials and post-marketing pharmacovigilance reporting. To our knowledge, this review is the first to provide a comprehensive coverage of the adverse events of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, as well as their management and counseling aspects for Asian type 2 diabetes mellitus populations.",
