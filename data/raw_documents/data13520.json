  "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medicines are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity and reduce rates of cardiovascular disease, including stroke, in people with T2D. Substantial evidence from real-world data and clinical trials highlights the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 medicines for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Similarly, there is growing evidence for the potential utility of using GLP-1 medicines to reduce rates of smoking, or use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or cocaine in individuals with substance use disorders. More limited clinical data suggest utility for GLP-1 medicines in patients with migraine or intracranial hypertension. The available data suggest that the use of GLP-1 medicines exhibits an acceptable safety profile in most individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we review recent clinical evidence and ongoing trials exploring the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 medicines across a broad range of neurological conditions.",
