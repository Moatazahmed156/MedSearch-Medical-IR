    "abstract": "According to the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV guidelines, a full physical examination is recommended in patients with possible late syphilis. The aim of this audit was to review all cases of late syphilis diagnosed at our centre since 1994 to see if a full cardiovascular and neurological examination was documented and also to see what a full examination contributed to the management of asymptomatic patients. Of the 480 medical notes audited, 295 patients were asymptomatic of whom 288 (98%) had normal physical examinations; the rest were either not documented, declined or defaulted follow-up. Seven asymptomatic patients had positive clinical findings but these did not lead to a diagnosis of cardiovascular or neurological syphilis. This audit has shown that performing a physical examination in asymptomatic patients added no benefit in diagnosing complications of late syphilis; it would appear that the physical examination did not alter the management.",
