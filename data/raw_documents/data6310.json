    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Ductal epithelial changes (lympho-epithelial lesions-LEL) in prostatic chronic inflammation (CI) are not well studied so far.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      to investigate LEL immediately adjacent to prostatic CI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied LEL in 144 prostatic surgical and autopsy specimens in various types of prostatic CI: NIH-category IV prostatitis (histologic prostatitis-HP), nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis (NSGP), and the reactive lymphoid infiltrates in the vicinity of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa). CI is scored as low and high grade (LG, HG) according to the severity of inflammation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      LEL was identified in all types of prostatic specimens and in all types of prostatic CI: in 70.9% of patients with HP; in 100% of cases with NSGP; in 68.7% and in 80% adjacent to BPH and PCa respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of the presence of LEL with HG CI (p<0.001). LEL showed strong membranous PD-L1 expression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study presents the first attempt to examine LEL in inflammatory human prostate. PD-L1 positive LEL have no diagnostic organ specificity, although they are a constant histological finding in HG prostatic CI. LEL, inducible after birth by CI, are an integral part of prostate-associated lymphoid tissue (PALT) and of the inflammatory prostatic microenvironment.",
