  "abstract": "Worldwide, 376 million people have chronic fatty liver disease which if not treated, progresses towards fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer, irreversible conditions causing 2 million deaths, 4% of all deaths. Therefore, there is a need for screening and monitoring fatty liver disease at its reversible stages on a community level. However, there is a lack of devices fit for large-scale, high throughput community screening. Here, we demonstrate a system for screening metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) using multi-spectral electrical impedance tomography (EIT) frequency difference reconstructions and anthropometric measures. This is done through the prediction of the Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP). The study also leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models such as Resnet-18 to significantly boost performance of such predictive systems. Overall, our predicted CAP is strongly correlated with clinical standard Vibration-controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) recorded CAP with a coefficient of determination R",
