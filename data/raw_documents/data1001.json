    "abstract": "Vitamin D analogs may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Tan et al. report that paricalcitol has additive effects with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in suppressing extracellular matrix expression, interstitial inflammation, and myofibroblast activation in obstructive nephropathy. Paricalcitol inhibited renin transcription, countering the compensatory ACEI-induced rise in renin, thus achieving a more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Vitamin D analogs may enhance the renoprotective effects of RAS inhibitors.",
