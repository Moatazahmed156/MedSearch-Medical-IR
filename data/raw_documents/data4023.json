    "abstract": "Diabetes insipidus is characterized by polyuria due to an inability to auto-regulate water balance resulting in dangerous metabolic derangements. Intraoperative anesthetics have been increasingly identified as a cause of diabetes insipidus in adult patients; however, it is rare in pediatrics. We present a case of a 16-year-old male undergoing resection of a recurrent left juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma who experienced intraoperative polyuria concerning diabetes insipidus. Urine output drastically decreased following discontinuation of dexmedetomidine with complete resolution within 24 h. We conclude that this case of transient diabetes insipidus was associated with dexmedetomidine administration.",
