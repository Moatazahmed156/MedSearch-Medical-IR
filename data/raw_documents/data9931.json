  "abstract": "The efficacy of nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs) in inhibiting the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is well-known. However, MRB therapy often leads to hyperkalemia and remains a major concern. Recent studies suggest that combining potassium-retaining diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduces the incidence of hyperkalemia. However, how SGLT2i, specifically affecting the proximal tubule (PT), suppresses hyperkalemia is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the interaction between the aldosterone (Ald)/mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling pathway and SGLT2i specifically in the PT, focusing on the synergistic effects on PT sodium (Na We investigated the effects of Ald and SGLT2i on PT Na Ald increased not only the activity of NBCe1 and NHE3 but also the expression of TWIK-1/ The findings indicate that Ald stimulates Na",
