  "abstract": "Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), seen as small hypointense spots on T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI, are primarily small brain hemorrhages. CMBs are common in community-based older adults and are linked to cognitive decline, reduced brain volume, and increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke, and mortality. In this study, CMBs that appear in both in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI were investigated and the association of these findings with clinical evaluations and neuropathologies were assessed. The longitudinal study included 37 community-dwelling older adults who participated in four aging studies (Figure 1). All participants underwent cognitive function testing and brain MRI annually. Whole brain 3D-T1w MPRAGE (1×1×1mm Of the 37 participants, 22 (59%) had at least one CMB in ex-vivo data, 24 (65%) showed exact match between in-vivo and ex-vivo CMBs (Figure 3a, 3b). In all mismatched cases, ex-vivo CMB counts were higher than in-vivo. The ex-vivo CMB counts were higher than in-vivo in participants with higher antemortem intervals, more cognitive impairment and CAA (Figure 3c, 3d). This investigation showed that CMBs observed during life persist in the brain and can be detected on ex-vivo MRI. More CMBs develop over time in individuals with cognitive impairment and CAA.",
