    "abstract": "Nanomaterials have been widely used in many fields, especially in biomedical and stem cell therapy. However, the potential risks associated with nanomaterials applications are also gradually increasing. Therefore, effective and robust toxicology models are critical to evaluate the developmental toxicity of nanomaterials. The development of stem cell research provides a new idea of developmental toxicology. Recently, many researchers actively investigated the effects of nanomaterials with different sizes and surface modifications on various stem cells (such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells, etc.) to study the toxic effects and toxic mechanisms. In this review, we summarized the effects of nanomaterials on the proliferation and differentiation of ESCs, mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells. Moreover, we discussed the advantages of stem cells in nanotoxicology compared with other cell lines. Finally, combined with the latest research methods and new molecular mechanisms, we analyzed the application of stem cells in nanotoxicology.",
