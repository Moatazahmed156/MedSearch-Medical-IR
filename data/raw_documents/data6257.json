    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists with all its virulence despite 650,382,819 doses of COVID vaccine worldwide. The reference test for infection identification is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The usefulness of this test may be diminished by simplifying its result as positive or negative. Determining the number of cycles (Ct) in positive RT-qPCR tests can assist in decision-making when interpreted in the clinical context of patients.",
