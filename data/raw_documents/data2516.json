    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a rare disease with distinct features not seen in other categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In recent years, advances in the understanding of disease immunopathogenesis have led to improved targeted therapies with significant improvement in patient outcomes. Despite these advances, there remain subsets of SJIA with refractory disease and severe disease-associated complications. This review highlights existing options for treatment of refractory SJIA and explores potential future therapeutics for refractory disease.Key Points:Despite targeted Interleukin IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors a subset of SJIA remains refractory to therapy. About 1 in 7 SJIA patients will be refractory to targeted IL-1 or IL-6 therapy.There is no current agreed upon definition for refractory SJIA and we propose in this review that refractory SJIA is presence of active systemic or arthritic features despite treatment with anti-IL-1 or anti-IL-6 therapy or disease requiring glucocorticoids for control beyond 6 months.SJIA disease associated complications include presence of associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), interstitial lung disease (ILD) or amyloidosis and management of each differs.Refractory SJIA treatment options currently include additional conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDS), biologic (bDMARDS), combination biologic therapy, targeted synthetic (tsDMARDS) or other immunomodulatory therapies.",
