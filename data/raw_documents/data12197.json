  "abstract": "Indolent lung cancer is characterized by slow progression, and the patient may die of other causes before it becomes symptomatic. The increasing usage of lung cancer screening technologies has increased the detection of early-stage cancers, improved survival, and reduced mortality, but it also brings overdiagnosis or overtreatment for indolent lung cancer patients. In this study, we performed high-throughput whole-exome sequencing in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with a tumor doubling time of more than 600 days (the indolent group) and another group with a tumor doubling time of less than 30 days (the aggressive group). We identified a novel germline variation in PDZRN4, rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362 G > A) in the indolent group. The rs74955204 variant resulted in upregulated PDZRN4 expression and was positively correlated with the survival of LUAD patients. We confirmed that overexpression of PDZRN4 inhibits the ubiquitylation of HIF-1A mediated by TRIM28, thus activating HIF-1A-IGFBP3 signaling to promote apoptosis, and inducing NDRG1 to inhibit EGFR-AKT signaling, restricting lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. With the EGFR",
