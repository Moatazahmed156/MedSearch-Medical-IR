    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is hypothesized to be associated with the concentration of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to SARS-CoV-2. High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed; nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/Co) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      CCP donor serum collected by three US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. Prediction effectiveness of various CoV2T S/Co criteria was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Seven hundred and fifty-three CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S/Co and NT50 of 71.2 of 527.5. Proportions of donors with NT50 over target nAb titers were 86% ≥1:80, 76% ≥1:160, and 62% ≥1:320. Increasing CoV2T S/Co criterion reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below increased. As target NT50 titers increase, the CoV2T assay becomes less accurate as a predictor with a decline in positive predictive value and rise in negative predictive value.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP. Product release with CoV2T assay S/Co criterion must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives. A two-step testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with S/Cos below criterion.",
