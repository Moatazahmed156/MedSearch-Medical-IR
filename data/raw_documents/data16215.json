  "title": "Bridging Early Adolescents' Online and In-Person Experiences: Qualitative Explorations of Emotional and Relational Well-Being in the Post-COVID-19 Era.",
  "abstract": "Technology plays a dual role in adolescents' lives, offering valuable avenues for social engagement and support while also introducing risks of social comparison, harassment, and loneliness. Qualitative data that centers on adolescent voices and contexts can illuminate the interplay of these protective and risk factors. In this study, we considered both physical and virtual microsystems and examined contextual data on early adolescents' online and in-person experiences as they transitioned back to face-to-face environments after the pandemic. We conducted virtual interviews with adolescents, parents of adolescents, and middle school administrators (N = 24). Thematic analysis was used to evaluate the data from a deductive, experiential approach. The interview questions were guided by the neo-ecological perspective, specifically around interactions in the hybrid proximal contexts during early adolescence. We identified five themes from analysis, including (a) Self-exploration in online spaces, (b) Technology influences on social processes, (c) Magnified aggression and risk in hybrid contexts, (d) Navigating digital boundaries at home, (e) Change over time and difference after COVID-19. Findings indicated that digital media use supported adolescent development by fostering interests and hobbies, helping adolescents navigate developmental changes, and facilitating social connections. At the same time, certain patterns of social media use fueled risks, including in-person aggression, exposure to mature content, safety concerns, and social comparison. These findings underscore the need for preventative interventions that teach adolescents a mindful approach to digital media use and provide support for vulnerable adolescents.",
