    "abstract": "Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) continues to be the most common treatment in the operative management of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Several other modalities have shown equivalence to TURP. However, even after surgical treatment, up to one third of patients have bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This review discusses the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management options for patients with LUTS after TURP.",
