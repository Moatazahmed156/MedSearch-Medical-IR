  "title": "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Breast Cancer in North Africa: A Retrospective Analysis of Feasibility, Safety, and Morbidity Reduction in a Real-World Setting.",
  "abstract": "Conventional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) carries significant morbidity in breast cancer surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) offers a less invasive alternative but lacks validation in resource-constrained environments. To compare postoperative morbidity between SLNB and ALND in breast cancer and assess SLNB feasibility. A retrospective study was conducted at the Mother-Child Department of Bizerte, Tunisia (January 2022-August 2024). Patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing SLNB or ALND were included. Primary outcomes were: lymphedema, lymphocele, pain [visual analog scale (VAS)], hemoglobin drop, and length of hospital stay. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v26.0. The Student's t-test was used for normally distributed quantitative variables, the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables with small sample sizes. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Among the 64 included patients, SLNB ( SLNB significantly reduces postoperative morbidity compared with ALND and is feasible in this resource-limited North African setting. Our findings support its integration into routine breast cancer surgery as a safe and effective alternative to axillary dissection.",
