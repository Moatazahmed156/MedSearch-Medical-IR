  "title": "The Effect of Seizures on Perinatal Outcomes in Pregnant Women with Epilepsy: A Single Center Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of epilepsy on pregnancy and delivery outcomes. It aimed to assess the relationship of seizure type, the presence of seizures during pregnancy, and the timing of the last seizure before conception on perinatal outcomes for pregnant women with epilepsy (WWE). The research included 300 participants, comprising 100 pregnant WWE and a control group of 200 healthy pregnant women. The study analyzed demographic and clinical data for all subjects. Perinatal outcomes were evaluated according to seizure type, seizure status during pregnancy, and the last seizure before pregnancy. The results showed a high rate of cesarean sections in the epilepsy group, at 71%. The number of babies born small for gestational age (SGA) was also significantly higher among WWE (p = 0.001). While there was no significant difference in most maternal and fetal outcomes between women with generalized and non-generalized seizures, the study identified pre-conception presence of seizures as a critical factor. Women who had experienced a seizure within the year before becoming pregnant had babies born at an earlier gestational week (p = 0.021) and with a lower birth weight (p = 0.018) compared to those whose last seizure was more than a year ago. Furthermore, 45% of the WWE had seizures during their pregnancy. The most important predictor of seizures during pregnancy is the presence of seizures before pregnancy. Presence of seizures during gestation is strongly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, whereas the specific type of epilepsy is not.",
