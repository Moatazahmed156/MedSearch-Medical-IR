  "title": "Asthma beyond the clinic: a decade-long narrative review of parental knowledge and practices in Indian children.",
  "abstract": "This narrative review explores parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward childhood asthma in India, covering aspects of disease etiology, stigma, trigger avoidance, and management, and their overall impact on asthma control and outcomes. A total of 17 studies from 2014 to 2024 focusing on parental KAP were analyzed, excluding those centered on healthcare providers or lacking KAP-compliance correlation. This review reveals widespread parental misconceptions, stigma, and poor knowledge about childhood asthma in India, influenced by regional and socioeconomic factors. Fear of inhalers, use of alternative therapies, and cost barriers to treatment are common. Improved, culturally tailored education and policy efforts are needed to enhance asthma care and outcomes. Parental KAP significantly influences asthma control, with gaps caused by misconceptions, cultural beliefs, and poor practices. Regional disparities highlight the need for context-specific strategies. Despite various global and national asthma guidelines, parental knowledge and practices in India remain poor. Culturally tailored education, community engagement, and policy support are essential to improve parental compliance and childhood asthma outcomes, particularly in underserved regions.",
