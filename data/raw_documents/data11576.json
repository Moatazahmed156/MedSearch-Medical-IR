  "title": "Cystathionine γ-lyase is a major regulator of cognitive function through neurotrophin signaling and neurogenesis.",
  "abstract": "Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), the enzyme responsible for neuronal cysteine and hydrogen sulfide production, is dysregulated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, both marked by cognitive decline in addition to motor deficits. To determine whether CSE loss directly causes cognitive decline, we genetically ablated CSE in mice. This loss was sufficient to induce oxidative damage, compromise blood-brain barrier integrity, impair neurogenesis and neurotrophin signaling, and elicit cognitive deficits. Global proteomic analysis further revealed molecular alterations that contribute to impaired neurogenesis. Our findings establish CSE as an essential guardian of homeostatic brain health and identify it as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders.",
