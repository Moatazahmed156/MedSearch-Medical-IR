    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) and atherosclerosis (AS) are the deadliest category of diseases globally. Preliminary clinical and preclinical studies have shown that stem cell therapy can alleviate symptoms; however, it has not yet achieved full functional regeneration of myocardial or vascular tissues. Stem cell therapy has shown the ability to reverse pathological processes through tissue repair, angiogenesis, and immune modulation. The main challenges of clinical translation remain the low survival rate and uncontrolled differentiation after stem cell transplantation. This paper systematically describes the classification, characteristics, and mechanisms of action of stem cells, as well as the pathological features of MI and AS and the limitations of traditional therapy. It discusses the challenges and solutions for the clinical translation of stem cell therapy. Such advances are expected to promote the development of precise, intelligent, and systematic stem cell therapies for MI and AS. This is very useful for creating multidisciplinary innovation systems in the future.",
