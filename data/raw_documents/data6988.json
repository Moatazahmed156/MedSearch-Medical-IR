    "abstract": "Epigenetic dysregulation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of ovarian cancer. Since the first experiment conducted on resistant ovarian cancer cells using demethylating drugs, multiple clinical trials have revealed that epigenetic targeted drugs combined with chemotherapy, molecular-targeted drugs, or even immunotherapy could enhance tumor sensitivity and reverse acquired resistances. Here, we summarized the combination strategies of epigenetic targeted drugs with other treatment strategies of ovarian cancer and discussed the principles of combination therapy. Finally, we enumerated several reasonable clinical trial designs as well as future drug development strategies, which may provide promising ideas for the application of epigenetic drugs to ovarian cancer.",
