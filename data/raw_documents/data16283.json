  "title": "Temporal single-cell analysis reveals age-associated delay in immune resolution after respiratory viral infection.",
  "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following acute respiratory virus infections. To elucidate the immune determinants underlying viral pathogenesis and delayed lung repair in the aged lung, a comprehensive time-course study was conducted. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high-dimensional flow cytometry were utilized to compare lungs from young and aged mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Aged hosts displayed diminished alveolar macrophage (AM) and dendritic cell (DC) but elevated monocyte-derived macrophage (MoM) and interstitial macrophage (IM) presence following infection. Additionally, enhanced accumulation of adaptive immune cells, including CD4 ",
