    "abstract": "Current wound healing treatments such as bandages and gauzes predominantly rely on passively protecting the wound and do not offer properties that increase the rate of wound healing. While these strategies are strong at protecting any infection after application, they are ineffective at treating an already infected wound or assisting in tissue regeneration. Next-generation wound healing treatments are being developed at a rapid pace and have a variety of advantages over traditional treatments. Features such as gas exchange, moisture balance, active suppression of infection, and increased cell proliferation are all central to developing the next successful wound healing dressing. Electrospinning has already been shown to have the qualities required to be a key technique of next generation polymer-based wound healing treatments. Combined with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), electrospun dressings can indeed become a formidable solution for the treatment of both acute and chronic wounds. The literature on combining electrospinning and AMPs is now starting to increase and this review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the current developments that combine electrospinning technology and AMPs in order to make multifunctional fibers effective against infection in wound healing.",
