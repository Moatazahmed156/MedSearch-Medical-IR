    "abstract": "Diabetic wounds are characterized by delayed and incomplete healing. As one of the most common complications of diabetes, diabetic wounds can be fatal in some cases. Programmed cell death (PCD) is an active and ordered cell death mode determined by genes, including apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. It is currently believed that PCD plays a crucial role in diabetic wound healing. Diabetic hyperglycemic environments can lead to abnormal PCD in various cells during healing processes, thereby affecting the activity and function of cells and interfering with diabetic wound healing. Therefore, this review focuses on the new roles and mechanisms of PCD in diabetic wound healing. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives related to PCD in diabetic wound healing are presented, which will bring new insights to improve diabetic wound healing.",
