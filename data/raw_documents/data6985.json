    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Therapy for these cancers is determined not only by stage but also by their heterogeneous pathologic features, genetic mutations, and biology. In this review, we will discuss types of epithelial ovarian cancer, and their associated genetic mutations and the implications for imaging and treatment.",
