  "title": "Anastomotic Leak Following Colorectal Surgery.",
  "abstract": "Anastomotic leak (AL) following colorectal surgery is a devastating complication. It is associated with high mortality rates, increased length of stay, and-in the setting of cancer-higher disease recurrence and worse overall survival. Further, it is associated with significantly increased costs, both for the acute hospital setting and the higher-intensity postdischarge care requirements these patients often experience. Identification of factors that prognosticate AL is important, as it may enable earlier detection and even patient optimization prior to surgery.",
