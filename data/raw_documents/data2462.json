    "abstract": "The diagnosis of synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer or metastatic cancer of the same histological type is difficult. In this study, molecular biology analysis was performed to determine ovarian metastasis from endometrial cancer. A 38-year-old woman had pathological evidence of endometrial cancer (endometrioid carcinoma, grade 1) and ovarian cancer (endometrioid carcinoma, grade 3); a disseminated nodule in the serosa uteri was also diagnosed as endometrioid carcinoma (grade 3). Customized panel sequencing revealed a common mutation pattern in ovarian cancer and disseminated nodules. Furthermore, endometrial cancer showed the same mutation patterns for FGFR3 and PTEN as ovarian cancer and disseminated nodules. All tumors were microsatellite instability high. Clinicopathological and molecular biology analyses suggested that the patient had ovarian metastasis from endometrial cancer. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with no recurrence. Molecular biology techniques may enable appropriate treatment based on clinically accurate diagnosis.",
