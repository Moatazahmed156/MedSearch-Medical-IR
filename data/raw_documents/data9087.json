    "abstract": "A new disease of tobacco with characteristic mild leaf curl and yellowing symptoms was observed in 2007 in commercial plantings in Pusa, Bihar, India. A begomovirus and a betasatellite were found associated with the disease. The associated begomovirus was identified as a strain of Radish leaf curl virus (RaLCV) based on nucleotide sequence of the viral genome (2,761 nucleotides; EU194914). The betasatellite (HQ180397) associated with TbYLCD was identified as a variant of Chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB). Recombination events were detected both in the RaLCV and ChLCB sequences. This is the first report of yellow leaf curl disease of tobacco, and the association of RaLCV with a disease of tobacco.",
