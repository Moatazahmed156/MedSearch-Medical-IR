  "title": "Cardioprotective Effects of the Natural Antioxidant Epigallocatechin Gallate.",
  "abstract": "Cardiovascular health is essential for human survival, yet it remains threatened by injuries associated with metabolic disorders, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion, and even general anesthesia. The development of a safe and effective cardioprotective agent would be of considerable value in diverse clinical settings. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the principal constituent of catechins, has garnered considerable attention owing to its diverse health benefits. As a natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, it has been shown in numerous studies to exert pronounced cardioprotective effects. In preclinical studies, EGCG not only protects the coronary arteries but also attenuates adverse cardiac remodeling, prevents regulated cell death of cardiomyocytes, and enhances cardiac function. In addition, clinical studies have confirmed its beneficial effects on metabolic disorders, endothelial dysfunction, and adverse cardiac remodeling.",
