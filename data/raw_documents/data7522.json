    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer type impacting women globally, both in terms of incidence and mortality rates, making it a major health concern for females. There's an urgent requirement to delve into new cancer treatment methods to improve patient survival rates.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Immunotherapy has gained recognition as a promising area of research in the treatment of breast cancer, with targeted immune checkpoint therapies demonstrating the potential to yield sustained clinical responses and improve overall survival rates. Presently, the predominant immune checkpoints identified on breast cancer cells include CD47, CD24, PD-L1, MHC-I, and STC-1, among others. Nevertheless, the specific roles of these various immune checkpoints in breast carcinogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion have yet to be comprehensively elucidated. We conducted a comprehensive review of the existing literature pertaining to breast cancer and immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing a summary of findings and an outlook on future research directions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      This article reviews the advancements in research concerning each immune checkpoint in breast cancer and their contributions to immune evasion, while also synthesizing immunotherapy strategies informed by these mechanisms. Furthermore, it anticipates future research priorities, thereby providing a theoretical foundation to guide immunotherapy as a potential interventional approach for breast cancer treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Knowledge of immune checkpoints will drive the creation of novel cancer therapies, and future breast cancer research will increasingly emphasize personalized treatments tailored to patients' specific tumor characteristics.",
