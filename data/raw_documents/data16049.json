  "title": "Neonatal multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-N) associated with prenatal maternal SARS-CoV-2: a single-center experience.",
  "abstract": "Neonatal Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-N) is believed to result either from the transplacental transfer of maternal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or from a delayed hyperinflammatory response triggered by the neonate's own immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we aim to explore the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and current approaches to the diagnosis and management of MIS-N in neonates. A total of 15 infants with MIS-N followed in Bursa Uludag University Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between January 2022 and January 2023 were included in this retrospective study. Eight mothers had a history of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. All of neonates had cardiac involvement (supraventricular tachycardia, persistant sinusal bradycardia or AV block) and 10 infants had respiratory failure. All infants had elevated inflammatory biomarkers and received steroids or/and IVIG. Two infants died. The common presentation of MIS-N included cardiac aritmia and respiratory failure. Newborns with MIS-N may be at higher risk for adverse outcomes. Early diagnosis and treatment are important in these patients.",
