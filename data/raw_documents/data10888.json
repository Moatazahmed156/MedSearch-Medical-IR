  "title": "Kaempferol Mitigates CSE-Induced Lung Injury and Epithelial Cell Ferroptosis via Modulating Nrf2/NCOA4/GPx4 Axis.",
  "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated necrosis driven by redox imbalance, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Kaempferol (KF), a bioactive flavonoid from Polygonati Rhizoma, exhibits anti-ferroptotic properties in lipid peroxidation disorders, yet its molecular mechanism against cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) remains to be fully elucidated. Using in vitro models of CSE-induced injury, we observed that KF restored cell viability and attenuated cytotoxicity by restoring redox equilibrium-significantly elevating glutathione (GSH) while reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and labile iron pool (Fe",
