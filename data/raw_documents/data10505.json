  "title": "Small RNA Profiles of Serum-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in the Comorbid Condition of Frailty and Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Observational, Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Frailty is increasingly recognized as a systemic complication in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases (OPDs), yet its molecular basis remains unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which transport small RNAs, may offer mechanistic insight into this comorbidity. This study investigated the association between serum-derived EV small RNAs and frailty in OPD. Sixty-eight patients with OPD were enrolled, and EVs isolated from 29 patients (13 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], four with COPD and asthma, and 12 with asthma; median age 72 years) were analyzed. Based on the Kihon Checklist, patients were classified as frail (",
