  "title": "Association between quality of life and inflammation and fibrosis markers in primary biliary cholangitis over three-year follow-up.",
  "abstract": "Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) consistently report low quality of life (QoL), but determinants of decreased QoL remain unresolved. We aimed to investigate the role of inflammation, fibrosis, and treatment response on QoL in PBC patients. We included 165 patients with 3 years of follow-up ( Median age was 62 years and 94% were female. Median QoL was normal (SF-36 mental and physical component summary scores [MCS and PCS] of 51.8 [IQR 41.1-58.1] and 49.1 [IQR 42.6-55.5], respectively). QoL was decreased in 32% (95%CI: 24-40%) and 33% (95%CI: 25-42%) of patients for MCS and PCS, respectively. Fatigue was the most frequent severe symptom (22%), while 13% reported clinically significant pruritus. Patients with cirrhosis (F4; TE > 16.9 kPa) had lower PCS scores than F0-F1 at baseline ( In Danish PBC patients, one-third had impaired QoL, primarily due to fatigue. QoL was reduced in cirrhosis but preserved in earlier fibrosis stages. Higher sCD163 was independently associated with lower physical QoL, particularly among UDCA non-responders.",
