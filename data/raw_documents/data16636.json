This cross-sectional study assessed the KAP relating to epilepsy among undergraduate university students and traders in Ghana using a structured questionnaire.

Regarding attitudes toward epilepsy, 27.6% were positive, but 84.2% acknowledged societal discrimination against PLWE. A third of the participants exhibited good/appropriate practices toward PLWE. The Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference between males and females on the possession of adequate knowledge about epilepsy (male = 282.75 and female = 251.43, p = 0.018, n = 532) as well as practices toward PLWE (male = 287.34 and female = 247.17, p = 0.002, n = 532).
