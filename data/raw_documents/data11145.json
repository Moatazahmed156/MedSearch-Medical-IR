  "abstract": "High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is widely used in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) treatment, but the optimal initial flow settings remain unclear. Research question Which initial HFNC flow rate provides the most effective and safe clinical outcomes for patients with AECOPD? Study design. We searched 7 databases for studies published before January 2025. Network meta-analysis was conducted using R software (version 4.2.3) within a Bayesian framework. The primary outcome was intubation rate, and secondary outcomes included short-term mortality, PaCO₂, pH, PaO₂/FiO₂, and length of hospital stay. The analysis included 40 RCTs with 3597 patients. HFNC showed no significant difference from NIV in intubation rates. HFNC_Low (20 to 30 L/min) significantly reduced PaCO₂, improved pH, and lowered incidence of nasal and facial injuries. HFNC_Mod (30 to 50 L/min) significantly shortened hospital stay. SUCRA rankings indicated HFNC_Low as most effective for PaCO₂, pH, and injury prevention, while HFNC_Mod ranked highest for reducing hospital stay. HFNC_Low demonstrates superior efficacy in lowering PaCO₂ levels, the incidence of nasal and facial injuries, and improving pH. Although HFNC_Mod may reduce hospital stay, low-flow settings are recommended as the preferred initial strategy for AECOPD.",
