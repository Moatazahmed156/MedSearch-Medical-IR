  "abstract": "A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 6 (ADAMTS6) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protease that promotes the invasion of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. Herein, we investigate its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that drives metastasis and drug resistance in LUAD. Re-analysis of microarray and RNA sequencing data from LUAD cells revealed that during EMT, TGF-β1 increased ",
