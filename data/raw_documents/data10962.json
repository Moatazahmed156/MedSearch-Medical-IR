  "title": "The clinical significance of gut microbiota of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with functional abdominal bloating and distension.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality. Functional abdominal bloating/distension (FABD), a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent sensations of abdominal fullness and/or visible abdominal distension without identifiable organic causes. FABD mainly impairs gastrointestinal functions-particularly intestinal transit and gas handling-rather than pulmonary function. This study characterized fecal microbiota in COPD patients with FABD to identify precision medicine biomarkers. Fecal samples from 20 COPD & FABD, 20 COPD, and 10 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed  COPD/COPD & FABD patients showed significantly higher fecal microbiota α-diversity (COPD  Gut microbiota signatures, particularly ",
