    "abstract": "Based on the perspective of ecology and innovation management, this paper selects seven elements from two aspects, innovation subject and innovation environment, to construct the evaluation index system for the health of pharmaceutical innovation ecological rainforest in Zhejiang from 2011 to 2019, together with the entropy weighted TOPSIS method and the obstacle factor diagnosis model. We find that the health of the pharmaceutical industry in Zhejiang can be measured as three stages: stagnation period, recovery period and development period. There is a relative balance between the development of innovation subject and innovation environment. The resilience of innovation subjects, followed by economic and cultural environment, is the key factor hindering the innovation of pharmaceutical industry in Zhejiang. Finally, we propose four countermeasures, including \"deploying high-level service chains, broadening investment and financing channels for enterprises, building a reservoir of global talents, and creating an inclusive and open soft environment\".",
