    "abstract": "Associated with the development of methods to quantify gastric emptying, there has been an increased understanding of the physiology of gastric emptying in normal subjects and the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of gastric emptying disorders. The measurement of gastric emptying, using radionuclide-labeled food markers and a scintillation camera, has widespread clinical and research applications.",
