  "abstract": "(Abstracted from N Engl J Med 2025;392:1801-1812) Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems improve outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), but their role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains uncertain due to limited, small, or uncontrolled studies. Many patients achieve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7% with glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, but those who do not may benefit from AID.",
