  "title": "B-Raf kinase blockade protects airway epithelial cells against respiratory syncytial virus infection and modulates interferon responses.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of hospitalisation due to acute bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants and young children. Recently, a maternal RSV vaccine (Pfizer's Abrysvo) has been approved to protect infants from birth up to 6 months of age. However, there is currently no vaccine or antiviral therapy against RSV for children aged >6 months. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel antiviral therapies against RSV infection for young children. We hypothesised that blocking a host protein called B-Raf kinase would inhibit RSV replication and protect airway epithelial cells against infection. We investigated the  Dabrafenib impaired RSV infection and replication (p=0.0003), while protecting cells against RSV-induced lytic cell death (p<0.0001). Proteomics and PCR analyses revealed that dabrafenib decreased the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes  Collectively, our data indicate that B-Raf kinase is involved in RSV replication, interferon-stimulated gene induction, and type I and III interferon release in airway epithelial cells following infection. We propose that repurposing dabrafenib as a host-directed antiviral against RSV may be valuable in reducing disease pathogenesis associated with RSV infection.",
