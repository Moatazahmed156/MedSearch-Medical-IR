  "title": "Age-related distribution of Influenza B and vaccine match in the 2024-2025 season: A multi-season comparative analysis.",
  "abstract": "The 2024-2025 season had the highest intensity of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in thirteen seasons, and severe influenza B disease was reported by hospital physicians among children. These, and the absence of influenza B/Yamagata after the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted the evaluation of the 2024-2025 influenza cases by age-group and influenza type, compared with previous seasons. Influenza-positive hospital and community cases for the 2024-2025 season and four previous seasons with influenza B circulation were retrieved from several data sources. Raw numbers and relative percentages of cases, including intensive or enhanced care unit (ICU or ECU), and 30-day mortality were evaluated by age-group and influenza type. Molecular characterization of influenza viruses of the 2024-2025 season was compared with other seasons. The 2024-2025 B/Victoria demonstrated molecular resemblance to the 2024-2025 vaccine. During the 2024-2025 season and other seasons with circulating and vaccine influenza B/lineage match, influenza B predominantly affected younger age-groups. During seasons with circulating and vaccine influenza B/lineage mismatch, the percentage of influenza B cases among older age-groups, was not substantially different that the younger age-groups. Influenza vaccination rates among children have been low throughout the evaluation period. Increasing influenza vaccination among young age-groups is paramount for reducing influenza morbidity.",
