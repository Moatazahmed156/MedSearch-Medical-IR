    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Accumulating evidence indicates the beneficial effects of sirtuins (SIRTs), including SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, in age-related diseases such as diabetes, neuron disease, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      SIRT1 deacetylates many targets, such as transcriptional factors and proteins, and exhibits renoprotection through reduction of fibrosis, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects and induction of autophagy in renal cells. SIRT1 may also participate in the regulation of blood pressure by sodium handling and by decreasing the responsiveness for angiotensin II. However, SIRT1 may be involved in the progression of cyst formation of renal epithelial cells in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). SIRT3 protects renal tubular cells against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      The activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for kidney diseases, but not for ADPKD.",
