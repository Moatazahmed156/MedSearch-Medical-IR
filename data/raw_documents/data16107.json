  "title": "STING agonist diABZI confers protection against swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus in neonatal mice by activating antiviral immunity.",
  "abstract": "The recently identified alphacoronavirus swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) has a high fatality rate in neonatal piglets. Currently, no vaccines or treatment strategies for SADS-CoV infection are available. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway plays a critical role in initiating innate immune responses against RNA viral infections; however, its role in host defense against SADS-CoV infection remains unexplored. We assessed the pathogenicity of SADS-CoV in 3-day-old, 7-day-old, and 3-week-old mice, revealing striking age-dependent susceptibility-a pattern mirroring clinical observations in piglets. Additionally, SADS-CoV infection activated the STING-dependent pathway, which resulted in significant interferon responses in infected mice. ",
