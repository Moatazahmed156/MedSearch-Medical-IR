  "abstract": "BackgroundAdverse childhood experiences have a lasting negative effect on both mental and physical health and likely increase the risk of dementia.ObjectiveOur study aims to investigate the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and dementia in Chinese older adults, and to explore whether sociodemographic variables and health status influence this association.MethodsThis study utilized data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and included 5092 participants. Logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the association between ACEs and dementia. Stratified and interaction analyses were conducted to examine the influence of demographic and lifestyle characteristics on this association. Two sensitivity analyses were further performed.ResultsCompared to individuals without ACE exposure, those who experienced three (OR: 1.292, 95% CI: 1.025-1.627) or four or more ACEs (OR: 1.363, 95% CI: 1.070-1.737) had a significantly higher risk of dementia, demonstrating a clear dose-response relationship. Subgroup analyses revealed that ACEs were significantly associated with dementia among adults aged 60-79 years, females, rural residents, highly educated, married, and reported lifetime history of drinking, no lifetime history of smoking, or short sleep duration. No significant interaction was observed between subgroup variables and ACEs in the interaction analysis.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated that Chinese older adults experiencing ACEs were at higher risk of developing dementia compared to those without. Preventing and mitigating ACEs will enhance neurocognitive health and promote successful aging.",
