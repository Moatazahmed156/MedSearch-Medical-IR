    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      This study was performed to explore the total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) concentration, free PSA (fPSA) concentration, free-to-total PSA ratio (% fPSA), tPSA density (tPSAD), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood in patients with concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and histologic prostatitis, and to provide new ideas for the diagnosis of prostatitis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients who underwent transurethral bipolar plasmakinetic prostatectomy from June 2017 to June 2018 were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the degree of pathological inflammation of the resected prostate tissue: group A (BPH with histologic acute and chronic inflammation), group B (BPH with histologic chronic inflammation). The preoperative PSA-related indexes and NLR in blood were respectively compared between two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Groups A and B comprised 59 and 41 cases, respectively. The values of tPSA, tPSAD, and NLR were all significantly higher in group A than B, and the value of % fPSA was significantly lower in group A than B (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference for the value of fPSA between the two groups (p > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Histologic acute prostatitis can cause changes of PSA-related indexes and NLR in blood, which has important clinical significance in diagnosis of prostatitis.",
