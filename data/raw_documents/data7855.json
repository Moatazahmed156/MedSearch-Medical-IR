    "abstract": "Amyloidosis is a complex group of rare disorders characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins in the extracellular space of various tissues and organs, leading to progressive organ dysfunction. The kidneys constitute a very common site affected, most notably by immunoglobulin-mediated (light chain, heavy chain, and light and heavy chain amyloidosis), but other types that include serum amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis and leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 amyloidosis, along with mutant proteins in several hereditary forms of amyloidosis such as transthyretin, fibrinogen α-chain, gelsolin, lysozyme, and apolipoproteins AI/AII/AIV/CII/CIII amyloidosis have been incriminated as well. The clinical presentation is variable and can range from minimal proteinuria for leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 amyloidosis to a full-blown nephrotic syndrome for AA amyloidosis. Clinical correlation, genetic analysis, and adequate tissue typing through a kidney biopsy are essential to make the correct diagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent. Except for AA and transthyretin amyloidosis, the treatment is usually purely supportive. Kidney transplantation is an acceptable form of treatment for end-stage kidney disease in all types of non-Ig-mediated renal amyloidosis.",
