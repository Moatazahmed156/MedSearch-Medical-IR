  "title": "Short-term neuropsychiatric outcomes following deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.",
  "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) is effective for Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms; however, effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms remain uncertain. Baseline and post-operative neuropsychiatric outcomes were retrospectively reviewed among a cohort of patients with PD undergoing bilateral STN- or GPi-DBS, using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). Absolute changes in psychiatric scores, rate of clinical meaningful score reduction (≥½ standard deviation below baseline scores), and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. Fifty-nine PD patients received either STN-DBS (n = 40) or GPi-DBS (n = 19). Clinically significant baseline anxiety (BAI ≥16) was present in 35.6 % of patients (STN-DBS = 13.50 ± 7.18; GPi-DBS = 17.47 ± 13.78). STN-DBS patients demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in anxiety (d = -4.75, P = 0.002) at 10.0 ± 7.4 months follow-up. Clinically meaningful anxiety improvement was observed in 52.5 % of STN-DBS patients (NNT = 1.9) compared to 26.3 % of GPi-DBS patients (NNT = 3.8). Longitudinal depression and apathy scores were stable for both groups. STN-DBS was associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in anxiety, while GPi-DBS did not reach statistical significance but still yielded clinically meaningful improvement in one-quarter of patients. These findings highlight the potential anxiolytic benefits of STN-DBS and suggest that GPi-DBS may also offer benefit for some individuals, warranting further investigation.",
