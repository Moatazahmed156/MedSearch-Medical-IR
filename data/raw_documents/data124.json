    "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated sleep quality changes in persons with advanced heart failure (HF) who were admitted to the intensive care unit. Sleep quality was assessed at admission, during hospitalization, and post-discharge. Statistical tests compared within subject mean sleep quality over time (n = 22). Poor quality sleep was reported by 96% of participants at admission, 96% during hospitalization, and 86% post-discharge. Significant differences were found between timepoints in global sleep quality, subject sleep quality, sleep duration, and habitual sleep efficiency. A greater proportion of these participants had poor global sleep quality during hospitalization than previously reported. Participants reported better sleep post-discharge than admission and during hospitalization. Interventions enhancing hospital sleep, along with home sleep self-management education, would improve HF outcomes. Implementation science methods are warranted to integrate efficacious interventions in this population.",
