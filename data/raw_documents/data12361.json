  "abstract": "Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a rare and life-threatening condition in which tumor cells cause pulmonary microvascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension. Clinical diagnosis before death is exceptionally uncommon. We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma who developed acute respiratory symptoms in the setting of metastatic disease. A combination of imaging findings, laboratory tests, and echocardiography raised clinical suspicion for PTTM and led to the initiation of targeted treatment before pathological confirmation. We discuss the clinical implications as well as diagnostic and therapeutic options for this rare condition.",
