    "abstract": "Study design:\n        \n      \n      Review of current approaches to gene therapy as a potential treatment modality for regeneration of the degenerating intervertebral disc.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Describe recent advances in the field of gene therapy pertaining to treatment of the degenerating intervertebral disc.\n    \n\n\n          Summary of background data:\n        \n      \n      The potential application of gene therapy to the treatment of degenerative disc disease has been an area of exciting and active research. Several in vitro studies have documented the capacity of gene therapy to favorably modify the biologic functions of the intervertebral disc cells with the delivery of the cDNA for various growth factors, whereas in vivo studies have reinforced this potential in animal models. Currently, investigators are exploring the therapeutic potential of gene delivery of the cDNA for several promising factors.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Literature review.\n    \n\n\n          Results/conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The application of gene therapy to the treatment of the degenerating intervertebral disc holds much clinical promise and continues to expand as an area of active research. The therapeutic potential of multiple agents, as well as possible vectors, are currently being investigated with encouraging results.",
