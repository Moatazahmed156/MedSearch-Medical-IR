  "title": "Respiratory-swallow coordination training using bimodal signal biofeedback for patients with post-stroke dysphagia: a randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "The purpose was to investigate the effects of respiratory-swallow coordination training with bimodal signal biofeedback on swallowing function in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. Post-stroke dysphagia Patients were randomly assigned to either the control group or the experimental group. The control group received conventional rehabilitation, while the experimental group underwent additional respiratory-swallow coordination training based on biofeedback. The training protocol consisted of three phases, conducted at an intensity of 30 min/day, 6 days/week, for two consecutive weeks. Outcome measures included the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) score, the Rosenbek Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) score, respiratory-swallow coordination, and videofluoroscopic swallowing study temporal and kinematic parameter. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and at a one-month follow-up. Thirty patients were enrolled. Both groups showed significant improvement in FOIS scores from baseline to both two-week post-treatment and one-month follow-up ( Bimodal signal biofeedback-based respiratory-swallow coordination training can effectively improve respiratory-swallow coordination and swallowing function in patients with post-stroke dysphagia.",
