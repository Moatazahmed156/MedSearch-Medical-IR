  "title": "From Metabolic to Epigenetic Memory: The Impact of Hyperglycemia-Induced Epigenetic Signature on Kidney Disease Progression and Complications.",
  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is a significant global health burden and a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diabetes mellitus is the primary cause of kidney disease, driving the progression of both micro- and macrovascular complications. Sustained hyperglycemia initiates a cascade of deleterious molecular and cellular events, including mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated apoptosis and autophagy, which collectively contribute to the progression of renal injury. Beyond these well-established mechanisms, a compelling body of evidence highlights the pivotal role of epigenetic alterations (such as DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNAs) in mediated long-term kidney damage. The interplay between transcriptional and epigenetic regulation underlies the phenomenon of the \"metabolic memory\", wherein cellular dysfunction persists even after glycemic control is achieved. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on mechanisms sustaining metabolic and epigenetic memory, with a particular focus on the epigenetic machinery that establishes and maintains these signals, a concept increasingly termed \"epigenetic memory.\" Given their reversible nature, epigenetic determinants are emerging as promising biomarkers and a compelling therapeutic avenue. Targeting these \"epifactors\" offers a novel strategy to halt progression to end-stage renal disease, thereby paving the way for precision medicine approaches in diabetes-related renal disease.",
