    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) symptoms are common after COVID-19 infections and despite recent efforts to study and treat, limited progress has been made. The most common of the symptoms, fatigue, can be debilitating and lack effective treatment options, and as a result, the need for potential management options is paramount.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We present a case report of a patient with refractory PCS fatigue. Following intravenous ketamine infusion, the patient noted significant improvement in his energy and fatigue symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We report the successful use of ketamine infusion for PCS fatigue symptoms.",
