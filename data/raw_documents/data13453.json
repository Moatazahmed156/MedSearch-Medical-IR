  "title": "Vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 expression emerges in substantia nigra dopamine neurons in mouse models of parkinsonism in the absence of neurodegeneration.",
  "abstract": "Subsets of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 and can release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. VGLUT2 We employed pharmacological models of reversible parkinsonism to determine whether acute DA depletion or DA receptor antagonism would increase VGLUT2 We found that acute depletion of DA or antagonism of D Our work provides evidence that VGLUT2 expression is induced in DA neurons under conditions of hypodopaminergia or D",
