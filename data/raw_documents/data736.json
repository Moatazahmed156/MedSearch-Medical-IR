    "abstract": "Disasters, wars and health emergencies profoundly affect mental health, with nearly 1/3 of affected populations developing conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression or anxiety, particularly among vulnerable groups like children, the elderly and the chronically ill. Access to mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) is often limited by conflict-related disruptions, stigma or resource shortages, while healthcare workers themselves face immense psychological strain and inadequate protection. Long-term strategies integrating disaster preparedness, mental health services and professional support are essential to safeguard both affected populations and frontline workers during emergencies.",
