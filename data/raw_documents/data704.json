    "abstract": "The attitudes of mental health workers toward individuals with mental health conditions can impact the quality of care they provide. Negative attitudes among mental health workers seem particularly common in response to people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The current review aimed to identify and review the literature regarding mental health workers' attitudes toward individuals diagnosed with BPD, specifically focusing on studies comparing workers' attitudes toward BPD with attitudes toward other mental health diagnoses. The findings suggest that mental health workers have more negative attitudes toward individuals labeled as having BPD than toward individuals with other diagnoses, such as depression. This is likely due to factors associated with the label itself, in addition to workers' perceptions of BPD symptoms and previous experiences of delivering treatment. The implications of these findings are considered, with a particular focus on how mental health services can effectively address negative attitudes toward BPD.",
