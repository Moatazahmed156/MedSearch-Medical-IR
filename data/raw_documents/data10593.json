  "title": "Sacred attention in the clinical gaze: Tagore, Shankaracharya and the spiritual dimensions of empathy.",
  "abstract": "In an era of technological acceleration, clinical evaluation is increasingly governed by digital diagnostics, algorithmic protocols and standardised efficiency. While these advances improve precision, they risk reducing the clinical encounter to an impersonal transaction-undermining the clinician's role as an ethical witness to suffering. This review essay proposes the concept of sacred attention as a necessary complement to the biomedical gaze: a cultivated, ethically attuned mode of presence that reclaims the human depth of clinical care.Drawing on the Indian literary and philosophical traditions of Rabindranath Tagore and Adi Shankaracharya, we reframe clinical empathy not as an affective impulse but as a contemplative practice. Tagore's vision of ananda dhara (the eternal stream of bliss) evokes a poetic theology of dignity, inviting clinicians to perceive the sacred within the mundane. Shankaracharya's affirmation chidananda rupah shivoham ('I am of the nature of blissful consciousness') offers a non-dualist ontology that critiques hierarchical detachment and affirms relational reciprocity in care.This framework has specific clinical and pedagogical relevance. We explore how sacred attention can recontextualise the physical examination as an embodied ritual, transforming it from procedural touch to ethical presence. We also examine how medical education can integrate literary-philosophical traditions to cultivate inner stillness, reflective awareness and relational depth in future physicians.By positioning sacred attention as a pedagogy of perception, this essay contributes to the medical humanities discourse on empathy, presence and rehumanised care. Healing, we argue, requires not only technical knowledge-but the moral clarity to truly see.",
