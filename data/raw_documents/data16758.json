  "title": "The biochemical dynamics of the glycogen phosphatase laforin directly impact brain metabolism.",
  "abstract": "Laforin is the only known glycogen phosphatase. Mutations in the laforin gene lead to the fatal childhood dementia and progressive myoclonic epilepsy known as Lafora disease (LD). A hallmark of LD is aberrant, cytoplasmic, glycogen-like aggregates known as Lafora bodies (LBs). Surprisingly, recent reports indicate that overexpression of a phosphatase-deficient laforin mutant, with the catalytic cysteine mutated to serine (LCS) rescued the formation of LBs in a laforin knockout mouse model. This finding led to questions regarding the biological relevance of laforin phosphatase activity and its role in LD etiology. In this study, we defined the in vitro and in vivo effects of the LCS mutation. LCS protein lacks catalytic activity but exhibits significantly higher binding to phosphate and long glucan chains compared to wild-type (WT) laforin. Additionally, LCS exhibits altered dynamics via hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and interacts more robustly with its binding partners malin and Protein Targeting to Glycogen (PTG). We demonstrate that these altered dynamics result in aberrant retention of the LCS protein in the brain of LCS knock-in mouse model, compared to laforin levels in wild-type (WT) mice. To examine the metabolic consequences of these biophysical changes, we compared the brain metabolomic phenotypes of LCS mice to WT and laforin knockout (LKO) mice. Furthermore, LCS mice display a distinct and significant global perturbation in metabolism. These results indicate a key signaling role for glycogen phosphorylation in glycogen metabolism, revealing an important biological role for laforin catalytic phosphatase activity.",
