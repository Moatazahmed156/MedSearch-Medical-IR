    "abstract": "Gene therapy in simple terms is the introduction of a gene into a cell, in vivo, in order to ameliorate a disease process. Human clinical trials have focused on the correction of monogenic deficiency diseases, cancer and AIDS. This paper summarises the technology of gene therapy, gives a brief synopsis of the current applications of gene therapy to veterinary medicine and discusses some of the problems which need to be overcome so that gene therapy can become accepted clinical practice.",
