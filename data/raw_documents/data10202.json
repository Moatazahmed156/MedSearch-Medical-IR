  "title": "Sex differences in long-term outcomes by platelet reactivity in patients with chronic kidney disease.",
  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased platelet reactivity following stent implantation. However, the effect of sex on platelet reactivity remains unclear and requires further investigation. We evaluated the impact of high platelet reactivity (HPR) and sex on 5-year outcomes in patients with CKD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using drug-eluting stents (DES). From the Platelet Function and Genotype-Related Long-Term Prognosis in Drug-Eluting Stent-Treated Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Consortium, 2126 patients with CKD were included. Patients were categorized into HPR (n = 939) and non-HPR (n = 1187) groups based on P2Y",
