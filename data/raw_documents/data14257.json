  "abstract": "Oxidative stress, the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant function, is a key contributor to the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). ROS-scavenging nanomaterials, which overcome stability and bioavailability limitations of conventional antioxidants, are an emerging class of potential therapies for osteoarthritis. Previously, we reported on engineering manganese dioxide nanoparticles (MnO",
