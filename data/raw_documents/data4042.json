    "abstract": "Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) is mainly associated with structural pathologies of the hypothalamic-pituitary area. Etiologies underlying CDI are identified in most patients, however idiopathic CDI is reported in 13-17% of cases after excluding other etiologies. The Hypopituitarism ENEA Rare Observational Study (HEROS study) retrospectively collected data of patients with idiopathic CDI from 14 pituitary centers in 9 countries. The cohort included 92 patients (59 females 64%), mean age at diagnosis was 35.4 ± 20.7 years, and a mean follow up of 19.1 ± 13.5 years following CDI diagnosis. In 6 women, diagnosis was related to pregnancy. Of 83 patients with available data on pituitary imaging, 40(48%) had normal sellar imaging, and 43(52%) had pathology of the posterior pituitary or the stalk, including loss of the bright spot, posterior pituitary atrophy or stalk enlargement. Anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies at presentation included hypogonadism in 6 (6.5%) patients (5 females), and hypocortisolism in one; during follow-up new anterior pituitary deficiencies developed in 6 patients. Replacement treatment with desmopressin was given to all patients except one, usually with an oral preparation. During follow up, no underlying disease causing CDI was identified in any patient. Patients with idiopathic CDI following investigation at baseline are stable with no specific etiology depicted during long-term follow-up.",
