  "title": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 and Osteoprotegerin in Vascular Calcification among Patients without Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease.",
  "abstract": "Objective Vascular calcification is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. However, the significance of calcification-related biomarkers in patients without advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear. Methods We prospectively enrolled 68 patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography followed by coronary angiography. This study assessed serum FGF-23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and fetuin-A levels along with the calcification of the coronary arteries, aortic valve, aortic arch, and abdominal aorta. Patients on maintenance dialysis were excluded, and the renal function was predominantly preserved (median eGFR 67.9 mL/min/1.73 m",
