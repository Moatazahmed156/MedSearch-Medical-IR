  "title": "Clinical Prognostic Value of C-Reactive Protein-Albumin-Lymphocyte Index (CALLY) in Patients with Stage III Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index (CALLY) and clinicopathological characteristics, as well as its prognostic value in stage III breast cancer patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinicopathological data of 187 stage III breast cancer patients who were treated in our hospital from 2010 to 2015. The optimal cut-off value for CALLY index was determined by ROC curve. Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for intergroup analysis. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons between groups were made using Log Rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the COX regression model. A nomogram prediction model was constructed based on the results of multivariate analysis and validated using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). According to ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value for CALLY was determined to be 0.10, dividing the patients into a low CALLY group (54 patients) and a high CALLY group (133 patients). CALLY was identified as a potential independent prognostic factor for stage III breast cancer patients. Patients with high CALLY values had longer survival time than those with low CALLY values (DFS:  CALLY index is a potential independent prognostic factor for stage III breast cancer patients. It provides new insights and methods for clinical diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.",
