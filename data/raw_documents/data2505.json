    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an umbrella term covering several distinct categories that share common features. The European League Against Rheumatism and the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society have published a consensus article with recommendations to guide radiologists and clinicians in choosing the best imaging technique for each particular clinical setting. A reproducible, accurate, validated, and long-established scoring system to use in everyday practice for monitoring and predicting long-term response to therapy is still to be developed on MR imaging for each joint.",
