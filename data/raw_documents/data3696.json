    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is etiologically classified into type 1, type 2 and other types of diabetes. Despite distinct etiologies and pathogenesis of these subtypes, many studies have suggested the presence of shared susceptibilities and underlying mechanisms in β-cell failure among different types of diabetes. Understanding these susceptibilities and mechanisms can help in the development of therapeutic strategies regardless of the diabetes subtype. In this review, we discuss recent evidence indicating the shared genetic susceptibilities and common molecular mechanisms between type 1, type 2 and other types of diabetes, and highlight the future prospects as well.",
