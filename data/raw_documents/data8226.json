    "abstract": "The unique personality of horses, combined with their environmental surroundings and the way they are used, makes them prone to a variety of injuries. As such, large animal practitioners are frequently called to examine and treat wounds on horses. Effective and proper treatment is predicated upon a reasonable knowledge of wound healing and how wound healing can be manipulated in a favorable fashion. The optimal end result includes return of full function, cosmetic healing, a short recovery period, and minimal cost to the owner. Not all of these goals are achievable in every case, but they should be kept in mind when treating all cases.",
