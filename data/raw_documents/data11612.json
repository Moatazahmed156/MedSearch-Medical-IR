  "title": "Anticoagulation Timing After Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation: Evidence from a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BackgroundThe optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulation (OAC) after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a critical clinical dilemma. Early anticoagulation may lower recurrent ischemic stroke risk but could raise hemorrhagic transformation risk, and current guidelines are conflicting. This meta-analysis examined the impact of early versus late initiation of anticoagulation on clinical outcomes-recurrent stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, Bleeding, mortality, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and thrombosis-in AF-related ischemic stroke.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and experimental studies that compared early and late anticoagulation; seventeen studies met inclusion criteria.ResultsEarly anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.55-0.96], ",
