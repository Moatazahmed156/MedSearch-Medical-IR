  "title": "Reduced EEG complexity in stable coronary artery disease: an evidence of covert brain dysfunction.",
  "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that coronary heart disease (CHD) is frequently accompanied by cerebral injury. Non-linear electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is an effective method for capturing abnormal EEG signal dynamics. This study characterized the complexity of EEG in CHD patients based on non-linear indices. Twenty-seven patients with CHD were enrolled, as well as an equal number of non-coronary controls. Five-minute, resting-state EEG recordings were obtained under standardized conditions. Non-linear dynamics were quantified using Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PE). Between-group differences were assessed by independent-samples t-tests. Within the CHD cohort, Pearson correlations were calculated between each non-linear index and clinical variables-age, disease duration, left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF %), and number of affected coronary arteries. Compared with controls, the CHD cohort exhibited significantly reduced LZC CHD patients demonstrated significantly lower total spectrum EEG complexity compared to non-CHD controls, offering novel electrophysiological evidence of central nervous system impairment in cardiovascular disease and suggesting potential functional brain alterations.",
