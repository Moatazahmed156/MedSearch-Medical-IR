  "title": "Pioneering Insights into the Complexities of Salt-Sensitive Hypertension: Central Nervous System Mechanisms and Dietary Bioactive Compound Interventions.",
  "abstract": "Salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) is an important and common subtype of hypertension, whose pathogenesis involves multi-level regulation, including the central nervous system (CNS), metabolic stress, and epigenetics. Dietary bioactive compounds have emerged as a research hotspot for SSH intervention due to their safety and multi-target effects. Although existing studies have focused on the CNS regulation of SSH or the role of individual dietary components, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis integrating multiple mechanisms, systematically summarizing multiple compounds, and incorporating a clinical translation perspective. This review first outlines the mechanisms of CNS pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications in SSH. Then, it systematically reviews the mechanisms of action and preclinical and clinical research progress of bioactive compounds, including capsaicin, taurine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, tea, and anthocyanins in SSH. In summary, this review systematically clarifies the complex regulatory network of SSH and the intervention potential of dietary bioactive compounds from an integrated perspective, innovatively proposes a precise dietary intervention framework, and fills the research gaps in the integration of multiple mechanisms and systematic evaluation of compounds in existing studies. This framework not only provides a new integrated perspective for the basic research of SSH but also offers key references for clinical dietary guidance, functional food development, and the formulation of targeted intervention strategies.",
