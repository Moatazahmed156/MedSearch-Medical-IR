    "abstract": "At present, current stimulation, ultra-sound, and light therapy have become effective methods to promote wound healing. Among them, infrared light is the most widely used method and is one of the important methods to promote wound healing. The therapeutic effect of infrared light on wounds is related to the effect of photobiomodulation on cells and molecules on the skin surface, but the mechanism by which photobiomodulation of infrared light promotes wound healing has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is necessary to study the action characteristics and the mechanism of photo-biomodulation of infrared light in promoting wound healing. This article reviews the effect of different types of infrared light on wound healing and the mechanism of infrared light in promoting wound healing.",
