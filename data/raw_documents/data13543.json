  "title": "Enteric glia, neuropeptides, and Parkinson's: impacts of calcitonin gene related peptide on gut alpha synuclein.",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous systems, influencing symptomology at both sites. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, a neuropeptide produced in the brain and intestine, has been linked with altered α-synuclein aggregation. This study examines the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide in modulating enteric α-synuclein accumulation and enteric glial cell reactivity using an ex vivo slice culture model from A53T",
