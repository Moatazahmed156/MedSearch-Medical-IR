    "abstract": "The most common presentation of the most common gynaecological malignancy (Endometrial Cancer) is abnormal PV bleeding. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is the first line investigation to assess the endometrial nature. Four to five (4-5) millimetre endometrial thicknesses is considered as the normal cut off in post menopausal women. But endometrial cancer can be present while endometrial thickness is less than 4mm. The author describes three cases of isolated endometrial cancer in Glangwili General Hospital in Wales, UK that was diagnosed despite endometrial thickness being less than 4mm and a brief review of the literature on its prevalence, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis and therapeutic approach.",
