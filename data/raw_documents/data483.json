    "abstract": "Most persons with diabetes mellitus are over the age of 60 years. Males develop diabetes more commonly than females. Older diabetics tend to have both impaired insulin release as well as insulin resistance. In older persons diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased functional status and cognitive dysfunction. In general, older persons with diabetes are inclined to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Managing diabetes in older persons requires special considerations because of their differences in pathophysiology of diabetes and strong association with functional, cognitive impairments and comorbidities. The use of strict therapeutic diets is not recommended in older persons. Treatment of hypertension and hyperglycemia can improve outcomes in older persons. The interdisciplinary team approach is important for care of older diabetic persons.",
