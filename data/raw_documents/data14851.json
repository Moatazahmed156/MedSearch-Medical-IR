  "title": "Immune-related adverse events in hepatocellular carcinoma: organ-specific patterns and management approaches.",
  "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The recent introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has transformed the therapeutic landscape of advanced HCC. Combination regimens such as atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab have demonstrated significant survival improvements over conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and have become the new standard of care. However, ICIs can trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs) through immune system overactivation, affecting multiple organs including the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, endocrine system, lungs, and heart. Patients with HCC frequently have underlying liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, placing them at higher risk of hepatic irAEs compared with other cancer types, which can markedly influence prognosis. The pathophysiology of irAEs is driven by a series of interconnected immune mechanisms, including excessive T-cell activation, disruption of immune tolerance, cytokine dysregulation, complement-mediated injury, and innate immune activation. Clinical decisions regarding the continuation, interruption, or discontinuation of ICIs, as well as the administration of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, should be guided by the severity of toxicity. Organ-specific management strategies and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential, particularly in severe presentations. This review summarizes the incidence, mechanisms, and management strategies of ICI-related irAEs in advanced HCC, providing practical insights for clinical decision-making.",
