    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to clarify the concept of exercise using Walker and Avant concept analysis method. The author offers a definition of exercise, including its distinction from physical activity and how the two terms are not the same and should not be used interchangeably. In the traditional concept analysis format will be used. Exercise is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposefully focused on improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness. Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure. Sample cases are provided. A clear definition of exercise allows health care providers to speak to patients about improving their physical activity, particularly given that physical inactivity is a leading but very modifiable risk factor for a wide range of diseases. One of the urgent goals of nursing should be getting people to become more active. This means communicating in clear terms with patients. Sometimes that will mean exercise, and sometimes that will mean simply moving more daily. Researchers of behavior change need to be precise in their definitions and the methods need to be provided in detail to be useful and reproducible.",
