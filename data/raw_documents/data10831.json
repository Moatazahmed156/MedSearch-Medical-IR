  "title": "SIRT3-SUMO regulated Treg cell differentiation and asthma development by mediating N-glycosylation through the FAO pathway.",
  "abstract": "Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease, has a high disability rate, which greatly increases the disease burden. T cells are pivotal in the pathogenesis of asthma, and Treg cells, due to their role in maintaining immune system balance, represent a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Initial weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis of asthma-related datasets indicates that N-glycosylation plays a critical role in asthma development. The establishment of an OVA-sensitized asthma model, along with the isolation of naive CD4",
