  "abstract": "Remote patient monitoring (RPM) involves the digital transmission and follow-up of health data. While its implementation has impacted healthcare professionals (HCPs), real-word evidence remains limited. We provide insights on the experiences, barriers and challenges faced by HCPs using RPM for chronic heart failure (CHF) management in a multisite hospital setting. A descriptive pilot study was conducted from October 31, 2022 to April 11, 2023 in three hospitals in Nouvelle Aquitaine, France. Patients with CHF were manually enrolled in a web-based RPM platform (Satelia A total of 379 patients were enrolled to use RPM, most were male (61.5%) with a mean age of 75.2 years. Three HCPs (one cardiologist and two ambulatory care nurses) were interviewed. Key challenges identified were limited human resources, difficulty managing alerts due to scheduling constraints and the transition from traditional care models. The need to recruit and train dedicated RPM-specialised nurses was emphasized to support the growing volume of patients, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial resistance encountered from hospital administration was reported, largely due to concerns about changing established care practices. Our findings offer practical first insights into the implementation of RPM for CHF. RPM was generally well accepted by HCPs in a multisite hospital setting. Addressing staffing needs and investing in training could be essential for scaling up RPM as reimbursement becomes integrated into the French healthcare system.",
