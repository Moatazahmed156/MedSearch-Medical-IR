    "abstract": "The initial observation of functional recovery in dysfunctional myocardium following revascularization led to the introduction of the concept of hibernating myocardium. Since then, the pathophysiologic basis of hibernating myocardium has been well described. Multiple imaging modalities have been utilized to prospectively detect viable myocardium and thus predict its functional recovery following revascularization. It has been hypothesized that viability imaging will be instrumental in the selection of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy likely to benefit from revascularization. Multiple observational studies built a large body of evidence supporting this concept. However, data from prospective studies failed to substantiate utility of viability testing. This review aims to summarize the current literature and describe the role of viability imaging in current clinical practice as well as future directions.",
