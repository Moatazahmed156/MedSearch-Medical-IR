  "abstract": "Serum samples were collected from  Distinct exosomal protein expression patterns were observed between AZM-sensitive and resistant patients. The HIF-1 and IL-17 signaling pathways were found to be associated with AZM resistance. Four proteins (KCTD12, LTF, TF, and MPO) were identified as potential biomarkers for distinguishing responders from non-responders. These biomarkers demonstrated over 80% sensitivity and 73.33% specificity in differentiating between the two groups. The study successfully identified four potential biomarkers (KCTD12, LTF, TF, and MPO) for AZM resistance in ",
