    "abstract": "The fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation known. Its phenotype includes large or prominent ears, macroorchidism, and characteristic behavioral problems. It has attracted the interest of cytogeneticists and molecular biologists because of its characteristic fragile site on the X chromosome. It has puzzled geneticists because of its unusual inheritance pattern involving nonpenetrant males. This syndrome has also spearheaded an appreciation of cytogenetic abnormalities in the etiology of all degrees of developmental delay.",
