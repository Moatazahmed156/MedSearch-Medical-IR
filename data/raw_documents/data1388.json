    "abstract": "Innovation and development in medical devices are of great significance for overcoming the problems such as the increasing costs of healthcare and the widening societal inequity in medical technologies. This paper presents the design and outcomes of a general education course in medical devices innovation offered for an eight-week quarter each year since Spring 2018 at Zhejiang University. The course consists of two modules, lectures and team project, both of which are well designed based on the entire innovation process spanning needs finding, concept generation, prototyping, and strategy development. A professional teaching team with eight experts from various disciplines and institutes has been established as well. Since its inception, 296 students from 34 majors have participated and 71 original projects have been proposed. The results of self-assessment questionnaires showed that the course had equipped students with broader fundamentals and specialized knowledge, and stronger skills in innovation and teamwork, which provide a solid foundation for students' future innovation practice.",
