  "title": "Associations between virus single or coinfections and respiratory symptoms in young children; a community-based cohort study.",
  "abstract": "Virus coinfections are common in young children. We quantified single and coinfections and their association with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in a prospective community-based cohort. Healthy children (<4 years) were randomly invited for participation. Between October-May of 2021-2024, weekly nasal samples and daily symptom diaries were collected over 16-weeks, regardless of symptoms. Samples were PCR-tested for 17 respiratory viruses. Associations between ARI and infection status (coinfection, single virus, none) were analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression. 228 children (median age:19.9 months) contributed 24,432 diaries and 3,332 nasal samples. Of 1,241 virus infection episodes, 247 (19.9%) were coinfections, 613 (49.4%) were associated with ARI. Single virus versus no infection increased the odds of ARI (OR:2.15; 95% CI:1.69-2.73). Three virulence categories emerged: Mild (not associated with ARI; enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus); Moderate (ORs:1.36-1.81; rhinovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2) and Severe (ORs:3.44-5.01; influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, RSV). Coinfection further increased the odds of ARI by 1.87 (95% CI:1.22-2.89), even when accounting for virulence category. About half of respiratory viral infections in young children are associated with ARI. This likelihood varies by virus, reflecting virulence differences. Coinfection increases the odds of ARI beyond individual virus effects, suggesting virus interactions mediate severity.",
