  "title": "Cardiac Tissue Damage in a Female Animal Post-COVID Model: Relevance of Chemokine-Mediated Inflammation.",
  "abstract": "Post-COVID cardiac complications have emerged as a significant and persistent clinical concern, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Animal models can act as proxies to investigate the pathophysiology of the human, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in cardiac tissue 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a female hACE2 mouse model, with a focus on chemokine-mediated immune activation. Twelve female C57BL/6 hACE2 mice were infected with the Omicron variant (BA.1.17 lineage) of SARS-CoV-2, and eleven non-infected mice served as controls. Cardiac tissue was analyzed via Western blot for markers of innate immune activation (TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α, CD11d). Cardiac tissue injury markers (iNOS, PAI-1 and Connexin43) were also analyzed. Compared to non-infected mice, cardiac tissue from infected mice showed significantly higher expression of IL-6 (",
