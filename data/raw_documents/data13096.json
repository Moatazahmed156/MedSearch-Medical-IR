  "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most commonly seen neurodegenerative disorders, where early detection of its biomarkers is crucial for effective management. Conventional diagnostic methods are often expensive, time-consuming, and highly complex, which highlights an urgent need for point-of-care biosensing technology. In this work, we developed assays on three-dimensional (3D) graphene foam electrodes by functionalising them with a 1-Pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pyr-NHS) to enable effective antibody immobilisation for the detection of amyloid beta peptides (Aβ42 and Aβ40), key biomarkers for AD. Pyr-NHS linkers were used for stable functionalisation, followed by binding with Aβ42 and Aβ40 antibodies, and then bovine serum albumin (BSA) was employed as a blocking agent to minimise non-specific bindings on the electrode surface. Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) measurements showed satisfactory stability over 12 days (RDS upper limit was <10%) and highly sensitive and specific detection of Aβ42 and Aβ40, with insignificant interference of tau217 protein. The biosensor exhibited a low limit of detection (LOD) with 252 aM for Aβ42 and 395 aM for Aβ40, covering 0.125 fM-1 nM and 0.125 fM-100 pM linear ranges, respectively. Further validation was conducted on spiked-diluted human plasma. This excellent analytical performance was attributed to the stable Pyr-NHS functionalisation, the 3D graphene foam enabling superior conductivity and a larger surface area on the working electrode, and the optimisation of antibody concentration for immobilisation. These promising results suggest that 3D graphene foam-based biosensors have considerable potential for early detection of AD biomarkers and developing cost-effective, portable, and reliable point-of-care devices.",
