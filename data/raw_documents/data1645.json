    "abstract": "The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is widespread. In Zhejiang province, China, CHIKV infection is often associated with travelers from tropical and subtropical countries. In the present study, three CHIKV isolates from serum samples of travelers in Zhejiang province in 2019 were sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed to study their molecular characteristics. Sequence analysis showed that the non-structural protein and the structural protein had 37 and 28 amino acid mutations, respectively; no mutation site was found at the E1-A226 residue, which could increase the adaptability of CHIKV to Aedes albopictus. All three samples carried two mutations, namely, E1-K211E and E2-V264A, which were introduced to Bangladesh around late 2015 and Thailand in early 2017. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these three CHIKVs were Indian Ocean lineage of the East Africa/Central/South Africa genotype (ECSA) and that the MF773566 strain from Bangladesh (Australia/Bangladesh 2017) had the closest evolutionary relationship. The three CHICKs imported into Zhejiang province in 2019 belonged to the ECSA genotype and had multiple amino acid variation sites. The variation in the three samples provides a certain reference for the subsequent research on CHIKV evolution.",
