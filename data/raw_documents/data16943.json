  "title": "Brivaracetam Combined With Topiramate at Low Doses Alleviates Neurobehavioral Deficits and Oxidative Stress in a Chemoconvulsant Kindled Seizure Model.",
  "abstract": "Epilepsy is a long-lasting neurological condition often associated with cognitive and behavioral comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, and memory deficits. This study examined the therapeutic effect of topiramate (TPM) and brivaracetam (BRV), both separately and combined, using pentylenetetrazole-kindled mice. Seizure severity was visually observed during the kindling process. After that, mice underwent a series of behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety, depression, and memory performance. Subsequently, neurochemical analyses were performed to assess cholinergic activity and oxidative stress markers. The TPM + BRV group showed significantly attenuated seizure progression during all PTZ doses (",
