    "abstract": "The prostate was examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 33 subjects, including five normal volunteers, 18 with prostatic carcinomas, seven with benign nodular hyperplasias, two cases of acute prostatitis, and one case of chronic prostatitis. Of 18 prostatic carcinomas, 16 produced an inhomogeneous signal intensity, with areas of diminished signal on T1-weighted scans and usually increased signal on T2-weighted images relative to the rest of the prostate. However, a similar appearance was also seen in five cases of benign nodular hyperplasia. It is doubtful at present whether MRI is able to reliably differentiate benign from malignant prostatic disease. Extraprostatic tumor extension and pelvic adenopathy was well shown, and MRI is very promising as a method for the preoperative staging of known prostatic carcinomas.",
