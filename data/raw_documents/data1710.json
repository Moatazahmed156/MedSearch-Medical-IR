    "abstract": "2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempo), previously reported by us to augment oxidation of glutathione induced by peroxynitrite (Glebska J, Skolimowski J, Kudzin Z, Gwozdzinski K, Grzelak A, Bartosz G. Pro-oxidative activity of nitroxides in their reactions with glutathione. Free Radic Biol Med 2003; 35: 310-316) was found to increase oxidation of glutathione induced by various oxidants, including persulfate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Tempo augmented also the inactivation and thiol loss of alcohol dehydrogenase induced by 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) (AAPH) and oxidative degradation of deoxyribose induced by ammonium persulfate and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. These results point to a pro-oxidative effect of nitroxides on a range of biomolecules subjected to the action of various oxidants.",
