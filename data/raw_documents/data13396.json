  "abstract": "Clear sex differences exist in AD and PD. Several studies examined genetic regulations for AD phenotypes and gene expression data in a sex-specific manner, identifying some differences between males and females. In contrasts, although proteins are final effectors of most physiological pathways and important drug targets, sex-specific regulations for proteins remain vastly understudied. This study therefore aims to investigate sex-specific genetic regulation of proteomics in neurologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We recently identified 3,373 pQTL for 1,886 proteins, many of which were unique to CSF, demonstrating genetic regulation specific to the CSF proteome (Western et al. 2024). Here, we performed a sex-stratified pQTL (in 1,640 males and 1,713 females, separately) with over 6000 proteins (SomaScan7K) on about 13 million TOPMED imputed autosomal variants. pQTL considered significant at p <5×10 We identified 1,684 significant pQTLs (1,047 cis and 637 trans) in either sex within 811 genetic loci for 1,488 proteins. There were 384 pQTLs (22.8%) identified only in one sex (215 in males; 169 in females). The male-specific pQTLs included locus for SNRPD2 on chromosome 19 (β =-0.76, p = 4.63×10 By performing sex-stratified pQTL, we uncovered distinctive sex-specific genetic regulation of CSF proteome. Our findings complement sex-aware eQTL from GTEx and provide insights on dissecting the underlying biological causes and mechanisms contributing to sex differences in neurodegeneration.",
