    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum and profoundly affect patients, caregivers, and health-care systems. This review synthesizes key research presented in the 2022 and 2023 Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Syndromes-Professional Interest Area (NPS-PIA) Year-In-Reviews, emphasizing six critical areas: (1) diversity and disparities, (2) diagnostic frameworks, (3) neurobiology of NPS, (4) NPS as a disease marker, (5) the impact of COVID-19, and (6) interventions. NPS accelerates AD progression, increases functional decline, diminishes quality of life, and heightens caregiver burden and institutionalization rates. Current treatments primarily rely on psychotropics, which offer limited efficacy and raise safety concerns. This review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about recent NPS advancements while identifying gaps for future studies to improve outcomes for individuals with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Research in Alzheimer's disease-related neuropsychiatric symptoms has rapidly increased, indicating heightened interest. Key areas include: diversity, diagnostics, markers, COVID-19 impact, and treatments. A road map for future studies, based on the key areas of research, is provided. This road map includes considerations to improve study applicability and validity.",
