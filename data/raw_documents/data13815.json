  "abstract": "To systematically investigate the rheumatic disease spectrum associated with anti-PM/Scl antibodies and to clarify their clinical significance in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). Patients who were tested positive for anti-PM/Scl antibodies by immunoblotting at Peking University People' s Hospital from January 2016 to December 2024 were enrolled. Clinical and immunolo gical data were systematically collected and compared across the subgroups defined by anti-PM/Scl75, anti-PM/Scl100, or dual antibody positivity. A total of 422 anti-PM/Scl-positive patients were enrolled. Among them, 83.2% (351/422) were diagnosed with connective tissue disease (CTD), 7.8% (33/422) were not diagnosed with CTD, and 9.0% (38/422) had an undetermined clinical diagnosis. Among 422 patients, most commonly represented by IIM (19.7%), systemic sclerosis (SSc, 14.2%), overlap syndrome (11.8%), undifferentiated CTD (UCTD, 10.4%), rheumatoid arthritis (6.9%), Sjögren syndrome (6.4%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (6.2%), the remaining diseases accounting for 24.4%. Within the IIM subgroup, dermatomyositis predominated (74.7%), followed next by anti-synthetase syndrome (21.7%) and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (3.6%). Anti-PM/Scl75 antibodies were detected in 52.1% (220/422) of the total patients, anti-PM/Scl100 in 43.6% (184/422), and both in 4.3% (18/422). In the subsequent detailed analysis of the anti-PM/ Scl-positive subgroup, double-positive patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of SSc (38.9%  Anti-PM/Scl antibodies define a broad disease spectrum encompassing IIM, SSc, overlap syndromes, and UCTD. Dual positivity for anti-PM/Scl75 and anti-PM/Scl100 identifies patients prone to systemic sclerosis and pulmonary involvement, suggesting additive pathogenic effects of the two antibody specificities. 探究抗PM/Scl抗体的风湿性疾病谱特征及其在特发性炎性肌病(idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, IIM) 中的意义。 回顾性纳入经免疫印迹法检测血清抗PM/Scl抗体阳性的患者，收集并分析患者的临床特征及免疫学指标，比较不同抗PM/Scl抗体亚型(抗PM/Scl75、抗PM/Scl100及双阳性) 患者的临床与免疫学差异。 在纳入的422例抗PM/Scl抗体阳性患者中，结缔组织病(connective tissue disease, CTD) 占83.2% (351/422)，未诊断为CTD者占7.8% (33/422)，未明确临床诊断者占9.0% (38/422)。在422例患者中，IIM占19.7%(83/422)，其次为系统性硬化症(14.2%，60/422)、重叠综合征(11.8%，50/422)、未分化结缔组织病(10.4%，44/422)、类风湿关节炎(6.9%，29/422)、干燥综合征(6.4%，27/422)、系统性红斑狼疮(6.2%，26/422)，其余占24.4%(103/422)。在抗PM/Scl抗体阳性IIM患者中，皮肌炎占比最高(74.7%，62/83)，其次为抗合成酶综合征(21.7%，18/83)和免疫介导坏死性肌病(3.6%，3/83)。在抗PM/Scl抗体阳性患者中，单一抗PM/Scl75抗体阳性患者占52.1% (220/422)，单一抗PM/Scl100抗体阳性占43.6% (184/422)，抗PM/Scl75/100抗体双阳性患者占4.3% (18/422)。在亚组分析中，抗PM/Scl抗体双阳性患者相比于单一抗PM/Scl75阳性或抗PM/Scl100阳性者更易出现系统性硬化症(38.9%  抗PM/Scl抗体阳性患者疾病谱广，以IIM、系统性硬化症、重叠综合征和未分化结缔组织病为主；抗PM/Scl75/100双阳性多见于系统性硬化症及肺部损害者。",
