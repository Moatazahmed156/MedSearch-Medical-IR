  "abstract": "Melioidosis, an often-fatal infection caused by  A 65-year-old male with a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with prolonged fever, respiratory symptoms, and altered mental status. Neurological examination revealed increased limb tone and extensor plantar responses. Imaging revealed subcortical white matter hypodensity and multiple centrilobular nodules. Initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was suggestive of tubercular meningitis; however, subsequent blood and CSF cultures confirmed  Neuromelioidosis remains a diagnostic challenge due to its ability to mimic other CNS infections, particularly tuberculosis. This case underscores the critical role of microbiological confirmation in guiding treatment. While the standard treatment protocol includes an intensive phase with meropenem followed by maintenance with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, delays in diagnosis significantly worsen outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for neuromelioidosis in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms, even in non-endemic, arid regions like Rajasthan. Timely diagnosis and targeted therapy are key to improving prognosis. This case highlights the need for greater awareness and diagnostic vigilance in atypical geographic settings.",
