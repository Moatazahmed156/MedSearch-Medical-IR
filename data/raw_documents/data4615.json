    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      There are a number of neurogenetic syndromes with well described behavioural phenotypes including fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Williams syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric conditions are often associated with the syndromes.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Parents (n = 381) of school-aged children with one of the four syndromes in the UK and Ireland were asked whether their child had been professionally diagnosed with ASD, ADHD or a mental health condition. Parents were also asked whether their child had been prescribed medication for behavioural or psychiatric reasons.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The highest level of reported diagnoses of ASD and ADHD was in fragile X syndrome. In all syndrome groups, lower rates of diagnosis were reported in comparison to previously published research. Prescribing of medication for behavioural/psychiatric reasons was highest in fragile X syndrome although the highest usage of melatonin was in Williams syndrome.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Reasons for a lower recognition of ASD, ADHD and mental health conditions in clinical practice compared with research studies may include 'diagnostic overshadowing' due to presence of intellectual disability and a genetic syndrome. However, there may also be a lack of belief in the utility of such diagnoses in neurogenetic syndromes among relevant professionals and/or lack of access to professionals with sufficient expertise in the recognition of such diagnoses in those with neurogenetic syndromes. The low rates of prescribing of medication for behavioural/psychiatric reasons may reflect the low level of clinical diagnoses or lack of belief in the utility of psychopharmacology in this population.",
