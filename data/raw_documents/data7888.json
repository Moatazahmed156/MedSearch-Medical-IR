    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with the early onset of glomerulomegaly, hemodynamic changes of a hyperfiltering kidney, and increased albuminuria, which are potentially reversible with weight loss. However, pathologic lesions of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis develop in experimental models of sustained obesity, and are observed in morbidly obese humans presenting with massive proteinuria. In addition, several observational, cross sectional and longitudinal studies document that obesity is as an independent risk factor for the onset, aggravated course, and poor outcomes of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for confounding co-morbidities including metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension, the major causes of chronic kidney disease. Early dietary intervention to reduce weight, and where necessary bariatric surgery, should be considered in the management of overweight and obese chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.",
