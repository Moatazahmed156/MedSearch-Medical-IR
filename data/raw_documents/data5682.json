    "abstract": "Major depression is impacted by the disruption of gut microbiota. Defects in gut microbiota can lead to microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction and increased vulnerability to major depression. While traditional chemotherapeutic approaches, such as antidepressant use, produce an overall partial therapeutic effect on depression, the gut microbiome has emerged as an effective target for better therapeutic outcomes. Recent representative studies on the microbiota hypothesis to explore the association between gut pathophysiology and major depression have indicated that restoring gut microbiota and microbiota-gut-brain axis could alleviate depression. We reviewed studies that supported the gut microbiota hypothesis to better understand the pathophysiology of depression; we also explored reports suggesting that gut microbiota restoration is an effective approach for improving depression. These findings indicate that gut microbiota and microbiota-gut-brain axis are appropriate new therapeutic targets for major depression.",
