    "abstract": "Heparanase is upregulated in various tumors, and its expression is closely associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, which accomplishes this mainly through degrading heparan sulfate and releasing heparin-binding growth factors thereby influencing multiple signaling pathways. In addition to its enzymatic degrading activity, heparanase can act via its non-enzymatic mechanisms that directly regulate various signaling. This review mainly focuses on the expression levels and role of heparanase in gastric cancer, and multiple genes and mechanisms regulating heparanase expression in gastric cancer. Furthermore, the development of heparanase-targeted immunotherapy and its potential application for treating gastric cancer are discussed.",
