  "title": "Bayesian Analysis of Frailty Risk Factors in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey.",
  "abstract": "Frailty in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Understanding the contributing factors to frailty in this population is crucial for developing targeted interventions and improving patient care. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify potential risk factors associated with frailty in chronic kidney disease patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) cohorts of 2011 and 2015. A Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model was utilized to analyze the relationship between selected features and frailty in chronic kidney disease. Of 1,924 participants, about one-third ( This study identified several potential contributing factors to frailty in CKD patients, with depression emerging as the strongest predictor. The counterintuitive relationship between creatinine levels and frailty underscores the complex interplay between muscle mass/quality and kidney function in frailty development, warranting further investigation.",
