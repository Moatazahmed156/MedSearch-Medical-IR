    "abstract": "Pericardial agenesis is a rarely seen congenital defect characterised by the partial or, more rarely complete, absence of the pericardium. Most often asymptomatic, it is usually incidentally discovered following the demonstration of heart's laevorotation on imaging, in the operating room or at autopsy. In this article, we report the case of an 80-year-old patient with asymptomatic complete pericardial agenesis fortuitous discovered. Pericardial agenesis observations are extremely uncommon reported in the literature, which substantiate its original epidemiological character. In addition, this observation brings some clinical, electrical as well as iconographic elements to better understand the pathology and raises clinical suspicions. Finally, this case report confirms the exceptionally symptomatic nature of the pathology, illustrating the irrelevance of treatment or specific follow-up.",
