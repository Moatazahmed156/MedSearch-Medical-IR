    "abstract": "The intestinal barrier is an essential component of innate host defense. The single layer of epithelial cells that line the intestine must balance barrier function with both active, transcellular and diffusive, paracellular transport. Tight junctions, which link adjacent cells, form a selectively permeable seal that defines both paracellular transport and barrier properties. Molecules can cross tight junctions by either of two distinct routes, termed pore and the leak pathways, that differ in capacity, charge-selectivity, size-selectivity, and responses to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. A third intestinal permeability route, the unrestricted pathway, reflects loss of the epithelial barrier, as occurs with mucosal damage, is independent of paracellular and transcellular pathways, and is neither charge- nor size-selective.The most commonly used approach for measuring intestinal permeability in vivo involves gavage of FITC-4 kDa dextran and analysis of the quantity recovered in serum. Unfortunately, this method cannot distinguish between leak and unrestricted pathways, as 4 kDa dextran can cross both. Moreover, 4 kDa dextran is too large to cross the pore pathway and, therefore, provides no information regarding this paracellular flux route. Here we describe a multiplex method that allows simultaneous, independent analysis of each pathway.",
