  "title": "Pro-Inflammatory Macrophage Phenotype Skewing Induced by Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields).",
  "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and often adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype that promotes tumor growth. Reprogramming TAMs toward an M1-like pro-inflammatory state is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), an FDA-approved, electric-field-based therapy, has recently been suggested to modulate immune responses in addition to its established anti-mitotic activity. Here, we investigated the direct effects of TTFields on macrophage activation and function. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were polarized toward a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype or an anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype and exposed to TTFields. TTFields rapidly activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1), and downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1, via c-Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK]) signaling. Functionally, TTFields reprogrammed M2-like macrophages by increasing major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80); reducing arginase-1 (Arg1); and elevating secretion of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and IL-12 subunit p70 (IL-12p70). In interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-primed macrophages, TTFields provided a secondary signal, driving myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In vivo, TTFields reduced tumor burden in an orthotopic murine lung cancer model and increased iNOS expression in both M1-like and a subset of M2-like TAMs. These findings demonstrate that TTFields directly reprogram macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, suggesting a novel immunomodulatory mechanism that may enhance anti-tumor immunity in the TME.",
