  "abstract": "The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ICD was determined. Phenotypic changes were assessed through assays measuring cell wall/membrane integrity, ion leakage, extracellular pH, total lipid content, and electron microscopy. The global response of  ICD exhibited potent antibacterial activity with a MIC of 400 μg/mL. It disrupted the cell wall and membrane, leading to ion leakage, pH alteration, reduced lipids, and severe ultrastructural damage. Transcriptomics revealed 66 differentially expressed genes, with significant upregulation of efflux pumps and TetR family regulators. Metabolomics identified 1,158 differential metabolites, indicating a profound metabolic rewiring characterized by depleted central carbon metabolites and accumulated fatty acids. Our results demonstrate that ICD exerts its antibacterial effect primarily by targeting the cell envelope, causing membrane disruption and energetic stress. ",
