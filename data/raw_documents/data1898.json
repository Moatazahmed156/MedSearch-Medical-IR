    "abstract": "Surgical literature has been criticized for the lack of high-quality research. The present review examines methodological quality of literature published in head and neck surgical oncology. We focus on landmark studies published on topics of best practice controversy, namely (1) the role of chemotherapy and organ-preservation protocols in the management of head and neck mucosal malignancies; (2) the role of selective neck dissection versus radical neck dissection; and (3) the role of laser microsurgery in the management of larynx cancer. Similar flaws were evident in selected landmark studies with the major issue being multiplicity in the form of multiple outcome analysis, comparison of multiple treatment groups, repeated measures over time, planned interim analyses, and subgroup analyses. The open nonrandomized controlled trial may be a feasible option in head and neck surgical research allowing for standardization, uniformity, consistency, and blinded outcome assessment.",
