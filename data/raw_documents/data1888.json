    "abstract": "Vascular anomalies are among the most common congenital and neonatal dysmorphogenesis, which are separated into hemangiomas and vascular malformations. They can occur in various areas throughout the body, with 60% being located in the head and neck. The true mechanism of pathogenesis of vascular anomalies is still unclear. Various treatment methods have been reported, and there are still controversies over the selection of different treatment modalities. Based on the clinical and basic research and current literature, the Chinese Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Vascular Anomalies formulated a treatment guideline for hemangiomas and vascular malformations of the head and neck, which will be modified and updated periodically based on new medical evidence and research.",
