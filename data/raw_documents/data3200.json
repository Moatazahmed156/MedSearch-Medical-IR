    "abstract": "Patients with leprosy rarely present ulcerated lesions that can appear during reactional states like Lucio's phenomenon (LP), as in our case. LP is a rare complication of multibacillary leprosy due to massive bacilli invasion of endothelial cells causing a thrombotic syndrome. The initial macular lesion is purpuric followed by multiple infiltrated papules and nodules, some of them ulcerated, associated to loss of sensation on lower limbs. The importance of recognizing ulcers as a specific cutaneous manifestation of leprosy allows early diagnosis and treatment, and therefore avoiding the development of disabilities and persistence of illness. Infection by Mycobacterium lepromatosis is associated with LP and it should be especially sought in patients from endemic areas.",
