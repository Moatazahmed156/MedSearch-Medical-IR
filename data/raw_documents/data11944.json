  "title": "From Mobility to Management: A Scoping Review on Exercise in Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a prevalent complication that adversely affects survivors' physical function and quality of life. Exercise is increasingly used in BCRL management, yet the diversity in exercise types and lack of standardization present challenges for clinical implementation. This scoping review aimed to systematically map and synthesize the available literature on exercise interventions for BCRL, focusing on the types of exercises used, their frequency and duration, and their effects on clinical and functional outcomes. Studies were included if they were randomized or non-randomized controlled trials involving adult women with BCRL, evaluated at least one lymphedema-related outcome, and were published in English within the last 10 years. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, and CINAHL databases using MeSH terms. Data were extracted on study design, sample size, exercise type, frequency and duration, and outcome measures. Out of 974 records, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. Exercises examined included resistance, aerobic, aquatic, Pilates, and scapulothoracic stabilization. Most interventions were 6 to 12 weeks in duration and applied 2 to 5 times per week. Exercise was found to be effective in reducing edema volume and severity, improving range of motion, pain, function, and quality of life, both independently and alongside CDT. Exercise is a safe and effective intervention for BCRL management. However, variability in exercise protocols highlights the need for standardized recommendations. Future studies should aim to determine optimal parameters to guide clinical decision-making.",
