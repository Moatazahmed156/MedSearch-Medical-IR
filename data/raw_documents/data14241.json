  "title": "Metformin and incident osteoarthritis: Causal insights from a co-twin control study.",
  "abstract": "In a co-twin control design, we aimed to examine whether individuals who initiate metformin treatment have an altered risk of incident diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), for up to 11 years after starting the treatment, compared with their non-treated co-twin. In all twin pairs different for metformin treatment (N=1 261 pairs) and all eligible twins/singletons (N=52 341) aged 35-75 years living in Sweden on December 31 Among treated twins, 68 (5.4%) developed OA over the 11-year follow-up, compared to 79 (6.3%) among the non-treated twins (crude HR [95% confidence interval -CI] = 0.86 [0.62-1.19]). Treated twins had higher BMI. Adjusted HR comparing treated with non-treated was 0.60 (95% CI =0.44-0.82). After 10 years, 6.7% (95% CI=4.8-8.6) of treated twins, compared to 9.7% (95% CI=9.3-10.1) of non-treated twins had incident OA, with difference of -3.1% (95% CI=-5.1- (-1.1)). Starting metformin treatment may be associated with a decreased risk of incident diagnosis of OA in specialist care over an 11-year follow-up period. The 10-year cumulative incidence was ~3 percentage points lower among metformin initiators than non-initiators.",
