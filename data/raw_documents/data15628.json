  "title": "Endobronchial Ultrasonography Features in Tuberculous Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy.",
  "abstract": "Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a sign for intrathoracic pathological process. Tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy (TML) could be an early sign for tuberculosis infection, especially in developing countries. Its incidence remains unclear due to underdiagnosis and limited access to diagnostic tools. Prompt diagnosis is crucial, as delayed treatment may lead to fatal complications. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a reliable procedure for getting samples and establish the diagnosis, although its use is limited by various factors. This study aims to elaborate the role of EBUS features to assess TML. This is a cross-sectional study that recruited 18 years old patients with suspected TML who underwent EBUS-TBNA. Mediastinal lymph nodes were evaluated through systematic approach by EBUS, focusing on the largest lymph nodes for further characteristics analysis. By TBNA needle, the retracted sample was evaluated for pathology, acid fast bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture and Xpert Ultra examinations. One hundred patients were recruited. Fifty-three patients received a final diagnosis of TML. There were significant association between TML and short axis size (p value <0.001), oval shape lymph node (p value 0.034), indistinct margin (p value <0.001), presentation of central hilar (p value <0.001), internal echo (p<0.049), thin layer echogenicity (p value 0.033) and nodal matting (p value <0.001). Xpert Ultra were showed the highest sensitivity in TML (71.7%) among diagnostic modalities. Endobronchial ultrasonographic features of small size, round shape, indistinct margin, central hilar, internal echo, thin layer and nodal matting were suggestive to lead for TML.",
