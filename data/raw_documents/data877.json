    "abstract": "The tight junction forms a barrier that limits paracellular movement of water, ions, and macromolecules. The permeability properties of this barrier are regulated in response to both physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, and this regulation has been modeled by pharmacological agents. Although it is now known that vesicular traffic plays important roles in tight junction assembly, the molecular mechanisms by which vesicular traffic contributes to tight junction regulation remain to be defined. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding mechanisms and pathways of tight junction protein internalization and the relevance of these to tight junction regulation.",
