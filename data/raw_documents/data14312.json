  "abstract": "Complications of thumb basal joint arthritis surgery include surgical wound pain and  In this descriptive study of 20 cryopreserved cadaver specimens, the anatomical distribution of the RNSB and its relationship with 1CMCJ anterolateral and dorsal approaches were determined by macro-dissection, and histomorphological analysis and digital imaging were used to measure cutaneous nerve ending density at the 1CMCJ and incision sites. In comparison to dorsal approach, the minimum distance from the RNSB was significantly shorter (1.30 ± 1.94 mm vs 3.70 ± 2.71 mm), and the total number (16.60 ± 8.50 vs 9.97 ± 7.51) and density (2.00 ± 0.83 vs 1.29 ± 0.77 mm The incision is closer to the RNSB pathway with Wagner's anterolateral approach than with Gervis' dorsal approach, crossing with nerve branches in 50% of cases. The density of nerves is higher in the skin overlying the anterolateral ",
