    "abstract": "Here we present the first described case of MALT lymphoma involving the foreskin. The patient presented with a lump proximal to the glans penis. It was treated with radical excision and histology revealed positive margins. No further therapy was given as this may have resulted in significant morbidity. The patient remains relapse free more than 2 years later. MALT lymphomas are the third most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for 8% of cases. They have been described at almost all extranodal sites but this case is the first involving the foreskin.",
