    "abstract": "Patients with JIA, specifically the polyarticular subtype, may present with temporomandibular joint arthritis. Given the pain typically present in the joint, limitations in opening may be noted. As such, oral health and hygiene practices may be compromised in this patient population. Dental management considerations during treatment include shorter visits, safe measures to maintain mouth opening, frequent breaks during procedures, and counselling on condition management to reduce risks in the future. In dental extractions, bite blocks or props may be used to complete the procedure safely and reduce pain.",
