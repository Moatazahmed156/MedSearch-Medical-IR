  "title": "Evaluation of sapogenin isolated from the defatted seeds of Camellia oleifera and its derivative as anti-breast cancer agents.",
  "abstract": "The defatted seeds of Camellia oleifera are an underutilized resource that leads to poor economy. Saponins extracted from these seeds exhibit anti-breast cancer effects. To augment their anticancer efficacy, the saponins were structurally modified by the incorporation of a thiosemicarbazone moiety to yield the Camellia sapogenin thiosemicarbazone (CST). CST was subsequently complexed with zinc to form Zn-CST. This zinc complex demonstrated markedly enhanced antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity in ER+ / PR+ MCF-7 cells (IC₅₀ = 3.21 ± 0.44 μM) and HER2- T47D cells (IC₅₀ = 9.80 ± 1.31 μM), demonstrating greater potency than erlotinib. In MCF-7 cells, Zn-CST induced cell cycle arrest at the G₀ / G₁ phase and resulted in a 27-fold increase in apoptosis. Additionally, Zn-CST exhibited more potent inhibitory activity against EGFR kinase, with an IC₅₀ value of 0.25 ± 0.02 μM, compared to erlotinib. Molecular docking analysis confirmed Zn-CST's superior binding affinity for EGFR with a binding energy of -102.7 kcal/mol, predominantly due to a strong electrostatic interaction with Asp831. Collectively, these findings suggest that Zn-CST could be developed as anti ER+ / PR+ breast cancer candidate.",
