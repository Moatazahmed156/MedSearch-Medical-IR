  "title": "A retrospective observational study to evaluate the association between self-reported binge alcohol drinkers and asthma.",
  "abstract": "To assess the association between binge drinking and asthma risk across demographic and socioeconomic groups. A retrospective analysis using the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) database. Binge drinking status was the exposure variable, and asthma diagnosis was the outcome. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were included as covariates. Cross-tabulations, chi-squared tests, and Fisher's exact tests were conducted, results reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Binge drinkers had a 5.2 % lower asthma risk (OR: 0.948, 95 % CI: 0.9245-0.9722). The greatest risk reduction was in ages 45-64 (26.8 %), while ages 18-24 had a 14.3 % increased risk (OR: 1.143). Men had 4.4 % higher asthma risk, while women had 1.1 % lower risk. Black and Hispanic binge drinkers had 8.1 and 2.3 % higher risk, while white binge drinkers had 8.4 % lower risk. Higher-income and education were linked to lower asthma risk. Binge drinking is associated with lower asthma risk in older adults and women but higher risk in young adults and men. Further research is needed to explore mechanisms.",
