  "title": "Determinants of Female Cancer Screening Awareness in Alabama's Black Belt Region.",
  "abstract": "Breast and cervical cancers represent significant health challenges in Alabama's Black Belt region, where they are leading causes of mortality among women. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing awareness levels of three critical female cancer screening methods: mammograms, clinical breast exams, and Pap tests. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 257 participants in Alabama's Black Belt region, utilizing self-administered questionnaires to gather data on awareness of female cancer screening methods. To identify significant predictors of awareness for each screening method, logistic regression analysis was employed. The study revealed high levels of awareness regarding mammograms, clinical breast exams, and Pap tests among participants. Women demonstrated significantly greater awareness of mammograms and Pap tests compared to men. Employment status and family history of cancer were identified as key predictors of awareness. Specifically, participants with a family history of cancer and those who were employed were more likely to be aware about mammograms, clinical breast exams, and Pap tests. Furthermore, self-reported health status was positively associated with awareness of clinical breast exams and Pap tests. Notably, the perception of racial impact on healthcare quality significantly influenced awareness of mammograms. Although this study highlights relatively high levels of female cancer screening awareness among women in Alabama's Black Belt region, there is a pressing need for concerted efforts to further enhance this awareness. Implementing comprehensive educational initiatives and improving healthcare resource provision are critical steps toward augmenting knowledge and achieving optimal cancer screening rates in this underserved community. Such measures are essential to mitigate cancer risks and improve health outcomes for women in this region.",
