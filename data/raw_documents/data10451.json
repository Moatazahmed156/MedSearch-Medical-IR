  "title": "Association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and coronary plaque progression in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease: a retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of coronary plaque progression in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, particularly focusing on the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and plaque progression across different stages of CKD. Two hundred ninety-two patients with CKD who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention during their initial coronary angiography and received follow-up angiography within 2 years were enrolled. These patients were classified into plaque progression and non-progression groups using quantitative coronary angiography analysis. Our findings demonstrate that patients with coronary plaque progression exhibited higher LDL-C levels and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Smooth curve and logistic regression analysis revealed a gradual increase in the probability of plaque progression with elevated LDL-C levels, each 1 mmol/L increase in LDL-C was associated with a 2.63-fold higher risk of plaque progression in patients with eGFR of 45-60 mL/min/1.73 m",
