    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Health inequities in head and neck cancer (HNC) disproportionately affect marginalized populations, including racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities, and those with low socioeconomic status. These disparities are driven by social determinants of health (SDOH), cultural beliefs, and systemic barriers, resulting in advanced-stage diagnoses and worse outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This review synthesizes evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical research, and public health data to explore disparities in HNC prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and clinical trial participation. It examines SDOH and cultural factors while identifying evidence-based interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Disparities stem from structural barriers, mistrust, and healthcare access gaps. Promising strategies, including telehealth, mobile clinics, and culturally tailored interventions, show potential for reducing inequities. Survivorship challenges emphasize the need for patient-centered, multidisciplinary care.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Addressing HNC disparities requires culturally sensitive interventions, equitable resource allocation, and policy reform. Future efforts should focus on implementing strategies to improve outcomes for vulnerable populations.",
