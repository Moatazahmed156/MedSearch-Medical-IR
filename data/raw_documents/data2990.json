    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To identify cases of diabetes insipidus (DI) related to sedation in the ICU to determine which medications pose the greatest risk and understand patterns of presentation.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Search terms included \"polyuria,\" \"diabetes insipidus,\" \"hypnotics and sedatives,\" \"sedation,\" as well as individual medications. Case reports or series involving DI or polyuria related to sedation in the ICU were identified.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We identified 21 cases of diabetes insipidus or polyuria in the ICU attributed to a sedative. Dexmedetomidine was implicated in 42.9% of cases, followed by sevoflurane (33.3%) and ketamine (23.8%). Sevoflurane was implicated in all 7 cases in which it was used (100%; 95% CI 59.0%, 100.0%), dexmedetomidine in 9 of 11 cases (81.8%; 95% CI 48.2, 97.7), and ketamine in 5 of 9 cases (55.6%; 95% CI 21.2%, 86.3%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Awareness of the potential for sedatives to cause DI may lead to greater identification with swifter medication discontinuation and subsequent resolution of DI.",
