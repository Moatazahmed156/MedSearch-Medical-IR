    "abstract": "Preliminary research in humans and rodents demonstrates that various probiotic formulations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have a clinical and neurochemical anxiolytic effect on the central nervous system (CNS). Further research is warranted to more extensively examine the theorized connection between the gastrointestinal tract and the CNS; however, initial evidence suggests probiotics affect various mechanisms of the gut-brain connection that modulate anxiety-like behaviors. This article describes the wider-reaching effects of probiotics, specifically related to behavior and brain function.",
