    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia seen in clinical practice. Although it occurs in any age patients, its frequency increases with age and is very common in the elderly. Atrial fibrillation causes substantial symptoms and morbidity and is an important cause of thromboembolism and stroke. The two approaches for therapy in those patients with intermittent or persistent atrial fibrillation are (1) maintenance of sinus rhythm with an antiarrhythmic drug or nonpharmacologic therapy, and (2) maintenance of atrial fibrillation with rate control. At the present time there are no data about the best approach and therapy must therefore be individualized.",
