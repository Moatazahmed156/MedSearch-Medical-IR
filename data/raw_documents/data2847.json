    "abstract": "We document a recurring seasonal aggregation of juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini along the beaches of the Gold Coast, Australia, with notable occurrences at Burleigh Heads and Kirra Reef. The aggregation consists of individuals of varying sizes, which likely suggests the presence of different cohorts, though it remains uncertain whether this area meets the criteria for a nursery habitat. Given the global population declines of S. lewini, its classification as Critically Endangered by the IUCN and its Conservation Dependent status under Australian legislation, we recommend standardised surveys and tracking studies to assess habitat use, seasonality and the potential role of Gold Coast waters as a critical habitat for juvenile S. lewini.",
