    "abstract": "Oxidation reactions have been extensively studied in the context of the transformations of biomass-derived furans. However, in contrast to the vast literature on utilizing the stoichiometric oxidants, such as m-CPBA and NBS, catalytic methods for the oxidative furan-recyclizations remain scarcely investigated. Given this, we report a means of manganese-catalyzed oxidations of furan with low loading, achieving the Achmatowicz rearrangement in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an environmentally benign oxidant under mild conditions with wide functional group compatibility.",
