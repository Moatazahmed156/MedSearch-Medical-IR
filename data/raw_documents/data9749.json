  "abstract": "Dapagliflozin (DAPA) has shown major nephroprotective effects, improving kidney metabolism and oxigenation. Lipidomics and metabolomics are powerful tools for understanding such effects, providing a comprehensive look at how SGLT2 inhibitors might change the metabolic landscape beyond their primary glucose-lowering action. We investigated changes in plasma metabolomic/lipidomic profile and urinary excretion of metabolites that could occur independent of increased diuresis. A two-armed, parallel-design, randomized clinical trial was conducted in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who received treatment with DAPA 10 mg/day or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/day for four weeks. Lipidomics and metabolomics were performed by high resolution mass spectrometry in fasting plasma and 24-hour urine samples collected before and after treatment. Compared to hydrochlorothiazide, DAPA significantly increased plasma isoleucine, methionine, citrate, β-hydroxybutyrate and decreased lactate. DAPA induced plasma lipid remodeling towards a significant raise in free fatty acids (FFAs) and some sphingomyelins and lysophosphatidylcholines containing these fatty acids. A significant change was observed in plasma medium- and short-chain acylcarnitines, positively correlated with changes in plasma FFAs and β-hydroxybutyrate. In addition, DAPA, but not hydrochlorothiazide, significantly increased 24-h urinary excretion of several amino-acids, lactate, TCA cycle metabolites, β-hydroxybutyrate and electrolytes, except for a decrease in malate excretion. DAPA treatment has major effects on the plasma lipidomic and the urine metabolomic profiles, with significant increased renal excretion of several metabolites, especially amino-acids, independently of increased diuresis. These data offer insights into the complex metabolic pathways leading to kidney protection by SGLT2 inhibitors. European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials No. 2015-004164-11.",
