  "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes.  This study aimed to isolate bioactive compounds from  Four cyanoglycosides and one cyanoaglycone were isolated from  Two previously undescribed cyanoglycosides were isolated alongside three known compounds. All five compounds demonstrated significant renoprotective effects in the high-glucose-induced HBZY-1 cell model. Mechanistically, these effects were achieved by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation, protecting mitochondrial function, modulating the expression of the glycolysis-related protein PFKFB3, and inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, collectively contributing to beneficial metabolic reprogramming. This study isolated two novel cyanoglycosides from ",
