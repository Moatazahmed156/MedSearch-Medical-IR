  "abstract": "Septic shock with acute kidney injury (AKI) carries high mortality in resource-limited settings. The oXiris We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort of adults with septic shock and KDIGO stage 2-3 AKI treated with CRRT using oXiris Fifty patients were analyzed (median age 56.5 [IQR 46.0-66.0] years; 32% male); 21 (42%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Norepinephrine requirements fell from 0.303 to 0.000 µg/kg/min over 72 hours (p<0.001), and vasopressin use declined to zero (p<0.001), while mean arterial pressure increased from 74.5 to 83.0 mmHg. In-hospital mortality was 62% (31/50) and was higher in patients with greater baseline severity (APACHE II 21.5 vs 14.5 in survivors; p=0.023). ICU length of stay was 14.0 days [5.0-22.5] and was longer in survivors than non-survivors (21.0 vs 8.0 days; p<0.001). Among survivors, 63% (12/19) were dialysis-independent at discharge. COVID-19 septic shock was associated with higher crude mortality (76% vs 52%) and lower renal recovery among survivors (9.5% vs 34%) compared with non-COVID sepsis.
