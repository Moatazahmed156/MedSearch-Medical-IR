  "title": "Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins as biomarkers for assessing the diagnosis and severity of coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction.",
  "abstract": "Biomarker discovery remains pivotal for improving coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infraction (AMI) diagnosis. While interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1/2/3) are established in viral defense and cancer progression, their roles in cardiovascular pathologies are undefined. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including a discovery cohort (129 CAD patients and 20 controls), a validation cohort (40 CAD patients and 16 controls) and a third cohort of 52 patients with acute myocardial infraction (AMI). Serum IFITM1/2/3 levels were specifically quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Coronary stenosis severity was assessed using the Gensini score. The evaluation of diagnostic performance utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, whereas Spearman's rank test facilitated the analysis of correlations. Compared with controls, CAD patients exhibited significantly elevated serum IFITM1/2/3 levels ( IFITM1/2/3 may serve as novel serum biomarkers for diagnosing CAD and AMI, as well as stratifying coronary stenosis severity, with high discriminatory capacity. Our findings position IFITMs as promising tools for precision cardiovascular risk assessment and therapeutic targeting.",
