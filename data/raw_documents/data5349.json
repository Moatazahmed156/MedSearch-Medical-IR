    "abstract": "Ovarian fibrosis, characterized by the excessive proliferation of ovarian fibroblasts and the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), serves as one of the primary causes of ovarian dysfunction. Despite the critical role of ovarian fibrosis in maintaining the normal physiological function of the mammalian ovaries, research on this condition has been greatly underestimated, which leads to a lack of clinical treatment options for ovarian dysfunction caused by fibrosis. This review synthesizes recent research on the molecular mechanisms of ovarian fibrosis, encompassing TGF-β, extracellular matrix, inflammation, and other profibrotic factors contributing to abnormal ovarian fibrosis. Additionally, we summarize current treatment approaches for ovarian dysfunction targeting ovarian fibrosis, including antifibrotic drugs, stem cell transplantation, and exosomal therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the research progress on ovarian fibrosis and to propose potential therapeutic strategies targeting ovarian fibrosis for the treatment of ovarian dysfunction.",
