    "abstract": "A multifaceted biological process of ageing culminates in the gradual decline of tissue and organ functions, escalating vulnerability to age-related diseases. Stem cell therapies, standing at the frontier of regenerative medicine, hold the potential to mitigate the challenges induced by ageing. By harnessing the unique regenerative capabilities of stem cells, these therapies aim to renew and heal ageing or damaged cells and tissues, thereby bolstering their function. In this chapter, we explore the potential of stem cell-based interventions against age-related degeneration, emphasising their underlying mechanisms, challenges, and future possibilities. As elucidated by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, ageing is characterised by an accrual of macromolecular damage, genomic instability, and loss of heterochromatin (Campisi et al. Nature 571:183-192, 2019). These aspects culminate in stem cell fatigue and a dwindling tissue regenerative capacity. However, with the advent of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine, we now hold the tools to reverse these age-induced changes by rejuvenating stem cells, the keystones of tissue regeneration, and fostering their proliferation and differentiation.",
