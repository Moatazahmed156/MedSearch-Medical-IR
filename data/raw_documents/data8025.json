    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Despite growing evidence, there is still uncertainty about potentially modifiable risk factors for neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS). This study aimed to identify potential clinical risk factors for EOS based on a literature review and expert opinions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A literature search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane, Embase, and Scopus databases. Articles in English, published up to May 2021, on clinical risk factors for neonatal EOS were included. Initially, a questionnaire on risk factors for EOS was developed and validated. The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to formulate the final version of the questionnaire. The validity of the risk factors was assessed using the Chi square test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the review phase, 30 risk factors were approved by two neonatologists and included in the FDM phase. In total, 25 risk factors met the consensus criteria and entered the validation phase. During the observational study, 114 neonates (31 with and 83 without EOS) were evaluated for two months. The results of the Chi square test showed that cesarean section was not a significant risk factor for EOS (P=0.862). The need for mechanical ventilation and feed intolerance was observed in about 70% of neonates with EOS, and therefore considered significant risk factors for EOS (P<0.001). Finally, 26 potential clinical risk factors were determined.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Neonatal-related risk factors for EOS were birth weight, one-min Apgar score, and prematurity. Maternal-related risk factors were gestational age and urinary tract infection. Delivery-related risk factors were premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and intrapartum fever.",
