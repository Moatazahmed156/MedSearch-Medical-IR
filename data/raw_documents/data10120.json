  "abstract": "Spending a single night at moderate altitude before ascending to high altitude may enhance ventilatory acclimatization but also exacerbate sympathetic activation, a response that should be carefully pondered in persons with coronary artery disease (CAD). Ten males with CAD participated in this randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial in a hypobaric chamber where they slept either at simulated 1900 m (intervention) or in control conditions (250 m, placebo) before being decompressed to 3000 m the following morning. Respiratory polygraphy was performed each night. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO",
