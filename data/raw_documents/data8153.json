    "abstract": "This article discusses the peculiarities of microglia behaviour and their interaction with other cells of the central nervous system (CNS) during neural tissue injury with a focus on spinal cord injury (SCI). Taking into account the plasticity of microglia, the influence of the microenvironment should be taken into account to establish the mechanisms determining the polarization pathways of these cells. Determination of the system of microglia interactions with other CNS cells during injury will reveal the patterns of post-traumatic microglia responses, in particular, determining both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. This review compiles information on changes in microglia activation, migration and phagocytosis, as well as their reciprocal effects on other CNS cells, such as neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in the background of SCI. The information contained in this article may be of interest not only to scientists studying traumatic injuries of the central nervous system, but also to specialists in the field of studying and treating neurodegenerative diseases, since the mechanisms occurring in the injured spinal cord may also be characteristic of pathological events in degenerative processes.",
