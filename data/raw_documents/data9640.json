  "title": "Effects of millet consumption on metabolic homeostasis (glycemic control and lipid profiles) in adults: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature to analyze the effect of millet consumption on metabolic homeostasis in adults. We conducted a systematic review of literature to evaluate effect of millet-consumption on metabolic homeostasis. Science Direct and PubMed databases were used to search articles till January 14th, 2025. Quality of randomized-controlled and crossover-studies were reported using the Cochrane-Risk-of-Bias-Assessment-scale, while that of non-randomized studies were reported using the Risk-of-Bias-in-Non-Randomized-Studies-of-Interventions-scale. One randomized-controlled study, three randomized-crossover studies, and two non-randomized studies were included. In participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), multigrain rotis prepared from finger millet, foxtail millet, sorghum, jowar, oats and maize reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, foxtail millet dosas reduced postprandial blood glucose levels and food prepared from heat-treated barnyard grains reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and LDL-c levels. Food prepared from powdered finger millet and little millet reduced FBG levels in prediabetics. Consumption of millet-based foods could improve glycemic response and LDL-c levels in individuals with T2DM. Both millet type and preparation methods influenced glycemic response. Future well-controlled trials on subjects from multiple ethnicities are needed for generating robust and actionable evidence of the role of millet consumption on metabolic health.
