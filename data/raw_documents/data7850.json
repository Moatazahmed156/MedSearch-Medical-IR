    "abstract": "The cardiovascular and renal systems share an intimate physiological relationship, wherein a perturbance in one system may have an adverse effect on the other. Since the burden of renal disease increases with age, there is a considerable interest in the pathophysiology of kidney disease in the geriatric patient population. This review will explore the physiological dynamics behind the increased susceptibility to kidney disease in this population. A better understanding of these pathophysiological changes may lead to improved prevention and management strategies.",
