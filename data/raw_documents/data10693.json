  "title": "Factors affecting medication and refill adherence among patients with asthma in Saudi Arabia: a stratified random cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation, leading to varying degrees of respiratory difficulties. Effective disease management depends on consistent medication adherence, which remains a significant challenge in Saudi Arabia. This study aims to assess the level of adherence to asthma medications among patients in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, and identify factors contributing to non-adherence. A cross-sectional study was conducted between may and July 2024, targeting asthma patients aged 18 years and older in Al-Ahsa. Participants were selected using a stratified random sampling technique from various geographic stria. Data were collected through structured phone interviews utilizing a validated questionnaire designed to assess adherence to medication refills. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with medication non-adherence. Only 39.3% of participants were adherent to their prescribed asthma medications, while 60.7% were non-adherent. Common reasons for non-adherence included stopping medications when feeling better (36.9%) and stopping medication due to side effects (20.4%). Female gender (p = 0.021), higher income (p = 0.034), being married (p = 0.049), urban residence (p = 0.001), and receiving medication support (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher adherence. Multivariable regression showed that younger age (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), male gender (OR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.16-2.69), lower income (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.97), and lack of medication support (OR = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.04-0.10) were independently associated with non-adherence. Medication non-adherence is prevalent among asthma patients in Al-Ahsa and is influenced by demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare-related factors. Interventions targeting support systems, education, and access may enhance adherence and improve asthma outcomes in this population.",
