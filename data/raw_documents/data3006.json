    "abstract": "Besides its efficiency, lithium has a narrow therapeutic index and can result in considerable toxicity. Among the potential side effects, two types of renal toxicity are observed: a decreased renal concentrating ability and a chronic renal failure. Lithium-induced polyuria is frequent, estimated to affect up to 40% of patients, and develops usually early. It may be irreversible, especially if the treatment has been prescribed for more than 15 years. A chronic renal failure is observed in patients treated for more than 10 to 20 years. Its prevalence is estimated at 12% after 19 years of treatment. Some patients (0.5%) may reach end stage renal disease. The major risk factor is the duration of exposure to lithium. Discussion about stopping or not lithium in case of renal failure needs multidisciplinary expertise and depends on psychiatric status and renal function.",
