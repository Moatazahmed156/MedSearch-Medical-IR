    "abstract": "Over 25% of all emergencies are classified as wounds, making them the most common health conditions treated by veterinarians. While equine wounds may heal with minimal intervention, many complications associated with wound management can occur, thereby delaying wound healing and leading to chronic non-healing wounds. Wounds should be closed primarily when possible; however, numerous factors influence the risk of complications. Infection and biofilm production are common causes of delayed wound healing. Other causes of non-healing wounds include the presence of foreign material, sequestrum formation, the development of exuberant granulation tissue, neoplastic transition, and habronemiasis.",
