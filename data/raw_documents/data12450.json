  "title": "Deciphering the Post-Operative Dynamics of Opportunistic Gut Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Patients.",
  "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that opportunistic gut bacteria contribute to the recurrence and chemoresistance in colorectal cancer (CRC); however, their fate after surgical resection remains poorly understood. This study investigated the longitudinal changes in these bacteria and assessed their potential persistence following CRC surgery. Forty fecal samples were collected from ten CRC patients at four timepoints: (1) pre-surgery (S); (2) one week (S1); (3) one month (S2); and (4) three months (S3) post-surgery. Fifteen other fecal samples were collected from healthy individuals as our study controls. Microbial profiling was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and quantitative PCR was applied to assess the changes in three opportunistic bacteria associated with CRC-associated. Our study revealed that ",
