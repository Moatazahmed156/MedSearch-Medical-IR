    "abstract": "Heart failure is a progressive disease that is associated with repeated exacerbations and hospitalizations. The rapid increase in the number of heart failure patients is a global health problem known as the 'heart failure pandemic'. To control the pandemic, multifaceted approaches are essential, ranging from prevention of onset to long-term disease management. Especially in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (stages C and D), surgical and catheter-based interventions are prerequisites for saving lives, preserving cardiac function, improving quality of life (QOL), and prognosis. In addition, various new medical technologies for these interventions have been clinically applied and have been shown to be effective against symptoms and improve the QOL and prognosis of patients with heart failure. Furthermore, the concept of interventional heart failure (IHF) therapy, which considers heart recovery and prevention of worsening of heart failure via multidisciplinary treatment using surgical, catheter interventions, and mechanical circulatory support devices, has been proposed worldwide. This review discusses the importance of IHF therapy in heart failure management, recent changes in interventional technologies and strategies for patients with heart failure, and worldwide education attempts for IHF specialists.",
