    "abstract": "Depression is a kind of worldwide mental illness with the highest morbidity and disability rate, which is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Experiments have demonstrated that the disorder of the intestinal microbial system structure plays a crucial role in depression. The gut-brain axis manifests a potential linkage between the digestion system and the central nervous system (CNS). Nowadays, it has become an emerging trend to treat diseases by targeting intestinal microorganisms (e.g., probiotics) and combining the gut-brain axis mechanism. Combined with the research, we found that the incidence of depression is closely linked to the gut microbiota. Moreover, the transformation of the gut microbiota system structure is considered to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on the development of depression. This article reviewed the mechanism of bidirectional interaction in the gut-brain axis and existing symptom-relieving measures and antidepression treatments related to the gut microbiome.",
