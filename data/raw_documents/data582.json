    "abstract": "Low back pain is a common problem with substantial social and economic issues. Physicians continue to have difficulty managing this condition despite an increased awareness of its magnitude. In addition, there is a misperception about the outcome of patients affected with low back pain; most continue to suffer from pain. We present a nonoperative approach and review various diagnostic and treatment strategies with respect to both scientific and clinical merit. Although many treatment strategies have not been well proved in the scientific literature, thoughtful review of the available information provides a basis for the use of these treatment methods in the patient with refractory pain. This approach can be used in conjunction with existing information to assist clinicians in the management of patients with acute low back pain.",
