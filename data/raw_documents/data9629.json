  "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complication, diabetic macular edema (DME), are major causes of visual impairment and even blindness. The occurrence of DR and DME is pathologically interconnected, and their clinical diagnoses are closely related. Joint learning can help improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This paper proposed a novel adaptive lesion-aware fusion network (ALFNet) to facilitate the joint grading of DR and DME. ALFNet employed DenseNet-121 as the backbone and incorporated an adaptive lesion attention module (ALAM) to capture the distinct lesion characteristics of DR and DME. A deep feature fusion module (DFFM) with a shared-parameter local attention mechanism was designed to learn the correlation between the two diseases. Furthermore, a four-branch composite loss function was introduced to enhance the network's multi-task learning capability. Experimental results demonstrated that ALFNet achieved superior joint grading performance on the Messidor dataset, with joint accuracy rates of 0.868 (DR 2 & DME 3), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach in the joint grading of DR and DME, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical decision-making. 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）及其并发症糖尿病性黄斑水肿（DME）是导致视力障碍甚至失明的主要原因。DR和DME的发生存在明显的病理关联性，临床诊断密切相关，联合学习有助于提高诊断的准确性。为实现DR和DME的联合分级，本文构建了一种新的自适应病变感知融合网络（ALFNet）。ALFNet以DenseNet-121为主干网络，设计了自适应病变注意力模块（ALAM）以捕捉DR和DME的独特病变特征，并通过共享参数局部注意力机制的深度特征融合模块（DFFM）学习二者间的相关性。此外，为了进一步优化网络处理多任务学习的能力，设计了四分支复合损失函数。实验结果表明，ALFNet在Messidor数据集上实现了最佳的联合分级性能，联合准确率分别为0.868（DR 2 & DME 3），优于现有方法。研究显示ALFNet在DR和DME联合分级中具有显著的优势，可提升疾病诊断效率与准确性。.",
