    "abstract": "Stem cells are the specialized cell population with unique self-renewal ability and act as the precursor of all the body cells. Broadly, stem cells are of two types one is embryonic stem cells while the other is adult or somatic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are the cells of zygote of the blastocyst which give rise to all kind of body cells including embryonic cells, and it can reconstruct a complete organism. While the adult stem cells have limited differentiation ability in comparison with embryonic stem cells and it proliferates into some specific kind of cells. This unique ability of the stem cell makes it a compelling biomedical and therapeutic tool. Stem cells primarily serve as regenerative medicine for particular tissue regeneration or the whole organ regeneration in any physical injury or disease condition (like diabetes, cancer, periodontal disorder, etc.), tissue grafting and plastic surgery, etc. Along with this, it is also used in various preclinical and clinical investigations, biomedical engineering and as a potential diagnostic tool (such as the development of biomarkers) for non-invasive diagnosis of severe disorders. In this review article, we have summarized the application of stem cell as regenerative medicine and in the treatment of various chronic diseases.",
