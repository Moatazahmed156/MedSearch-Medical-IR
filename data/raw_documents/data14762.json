  "title": "A Retrospective Study of Invasive Candidiasis in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital.",
  "abstract": "Introduction Invasive candidiasis is a leading cause of fungal infections in hospitalized and critically ill patients, with high morbidity and mortality. There are numerous factors which may predispose to its development. In recent years, there has been a change in the etiological spectrum, and emerging resistance to antifungal drugs seen in some patients, further complicating management. Aims and objectives The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological and microbiological profile of invasive candidiasis in a tertiary teaching hospital, with a focus on species distribution, antifungal resistance patterns, clinical risk factors, and patient outcomes. Materials and methods This retrospective study included all consecutive adult inpatients with invasive candidiasis admitted to Bharati Hospital & Research Centre, Pune, India, from April 2019 to March 2022. This cohort represents all eligible cases (n=86) identified during the study period, and therefore, the sample size was determined by case availability rather than a prior statistical calculation. Data were collected to evaluate species distribution and evolving epidemiology, identify associated risk factors, analyse antifungal susceptibility patterns, and determine mortality outcomes.
