  "title": "Gut Guardianship: Recommendations for Rational Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors in Chronic Kidney Disease.",
  "abstract": "The widespread use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has raised safety concerns, especially among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where long-term use has been linked with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), hypomagnesaemia, and potential progression to endstage kidney disease (ESKD). Recent observational studies and meta-analyses have yielded mixed evidence, calling for a nuanced and individualized approach to acid suppression in CKD. The concept of gut guardianship emphasizes cautious, indication-based prescribing, dose minimization, and structured deprescribing to preserve gut-renal health. This article reviews the current evidence and proposes a clinical toolkit for rational PPI use in CKD, based on risk stratification, guideline-based indications, and ongoing monitoring.",
