  "abstract": "White matter inflammation significantly contributes to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in the translocator protein (TSPO), an in-vivo marker of brain inflammation, have been observed in white matter (WM) through in-vitro binding assays, immunostaining, and TSPO PET-based quantification. Our objective was to assess the effects of glial inflammation in WM via TSPO-PET on AD biomarkers and cognitive decline, beyond grey matter (GM) inflammation, across the AD spectrum. Eighty-eight elderly participants from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia cohort (44% Aβ-positive, 38% cognitively impaired) underwent diffusion-weighted MRI, TSPO-PET ( We observed a significant three-way interaction between amyloid, GM TSPO, and WM TSPO on Tau (Braak-3 tau: p = 0.013, Braak-4: p = 0.029, Braak-5: p = 0.018, Braak-6: p = 0.005). Decomposing this interaction, individuals with greater amyloid in the presence of greater occipital WM TSPO displayed greater Tau (Figure 1A, left: Braak-3 tau, right: Braak-6 tau). No such effect was found with GM TSPO in the occipital lobe (Figure 1B) but there was a significant effect with GM TSPO in the cingulate cortex (Braak-45 tau: p = 0.001-0.004). Further, TSPO signal in the occipital WM was associated with greater concentrations of plasma GFAP (p = 0.039) and with lower fiber integrity (p = 0.029), but there was no association with plasma Aβ4240, ptau231, ptau181, or NfL. Last, TSPO signal in the occipital WM modulated the effect of amyloid-related tau increases on several cognitive domains (including executive function and language; Figure 2). Inflammation in the posterior WM, as quantified through TSPO-PET, modulated the relationship between amyloid and tau and between amyloid-related tau effects on cognitive dysfunction. These effects were beyond GM TSPO. Our findings highlight the importance of WM inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD.",
