Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, acid-fast bacillus staining, and  In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who exhibit persistent fever or suboptimal response despite appropriate therapy-and after excluding drug resistance-scrub typhus should be included in the differential diagnosis, even in non-endemic settings without a typical exposure history. Longitudinal imaging in this case also shows that irreversible structural remodeling may occur despite microbiologic control, underscoring the need to pair prompt pathogen-directed therapy with ongoing monitoring and early strategies to preserve lung function.",
