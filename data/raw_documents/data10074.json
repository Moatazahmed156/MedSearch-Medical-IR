  "title": "Nonhematopoietic MicroRNA-26b",
  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, and microRNA-26b (miR-26b) has emerged as a significant regulator in its development. This study investigates the role of nonhematopoietic miR-26b in atherosclerosis. To study the specific role of nonhematopoietic cell miR-26b in atherosclerosis development, we used a reverse bone marrow transplantation model combined with 12-week Western-type diet feeding. Nonhematopoietic-specific miR-26b deficiency exacerbated atherosclerosis, characterized by larger plaques with increased collagen and necrotic core content. Enhanced VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) expression correlated with elevated leukocyte adhesion in ex vivo perfusion studies. Restoration of miR-26b levels in human coronary artery endothelial cells reduced inflammatory responses and leukocyte adhesion. Our findings highlight that nonhematopoietic miR-26b plays a protective role in atherosclerosis by modulating endothelial cell function, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for miR-26b mimics in cardiovascular disease management.",
