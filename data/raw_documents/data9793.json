  "title": "Obesity and Dural Venous Sinus Thrombosis: An Unusual Presentation of an Uncommon Stroke.",
  "abstract": "Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) is a subset of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and is a rare diagnosis, typically observed in women or people with identifiable hypercoagulable risk factors. DVST can present similarly to other medical conditions, requiring neuroimaging for accurate identification and prompt treatment. Obesity, a rapidly growing global health problem with numerous health implications, is not well defined as being associated with DVST in the available medical literature. In this case report, we describe a male patient presenting with headache and vision changes, initially suspicious for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, ultimately diagnosed with DVST whose sole identifiable risk factor was obesity, representing a potential expansion of the current understanding of CVST risk stratification.",
