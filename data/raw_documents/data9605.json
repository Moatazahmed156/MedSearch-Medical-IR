  "title": "Effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in preventing T2DM in high-risk patients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "There are conflicting results and limited data regarding the individual effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and their combined action in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in high-risk adults. An updated investigation is warranted. We aimed to explore their effectiveness in preventing T2DM in high-risk patients and assess changes in body weight/body mass index (BMI), glycemic parameters, and safety. PubMed, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) were conducted. GRADE assessment was conducted for rating the overall certainty of evidence. All 24,157 participants in 10 GLP-1 RA RCTs were overweight/obese. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 RAs reduced T2DM incidence (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.28, 0.94;  GLP-1 RAs may prevent diabetes in high-risk adults and ameliorate body and glycemic factors. Their effectiveness should be considered carefully due to the low quality of evidence. No safety issues were identified. Future investigation is necessary to provide consistency of estimations.
