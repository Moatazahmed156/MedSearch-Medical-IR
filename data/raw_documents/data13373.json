  "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily idiopathic, genetic mutations-accounting for approximately 5%-15% of cases with regional variability-have prompted the development of gene expression modulators, such as oligonucleotides, to target and reduce alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation. However, challenges in delivering these agents to the brain have limited their therapeutic potential. This study systematically reviews the use of exosomes as delivery systems for oligonucleotides aimed at reducing α-syn aggregation in PD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Scopus, Embase, OVID, and ISI Web of Science databases up to January 2022, targeting ",
