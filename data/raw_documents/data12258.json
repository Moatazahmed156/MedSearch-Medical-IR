  "title": "Design an open-access dynamic spot-scanning proton arc system controller for quantitative and comprehensive investigation of delivery efficiency.",
  "abstract": "Proton arc therapy enables continuous treatment delivery while rotating the gantry. One of the key components in the proton arc system is the controller's design, which determines the irradiation sequence and gantry mechanical rotation. This study aims to develop a novel and open-access proton arc system controller (controller The controller The result indicates that the significant impact of dynamic treatment delivery time comes from the buffer window setting relative to the tolerance window, in which a large buffer leads to a slower delivery process. On the other hand, the maximum acceleration and deceleration speed plays an important role in the treatment delivery efficiency if the buffer window occupies large portion of each tolerance window. Additionally, the buffer window setting also impacts the total momentum changes during the dynamic treatment delivery. The study introduced the first open-access controller",
