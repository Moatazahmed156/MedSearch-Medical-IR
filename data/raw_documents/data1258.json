    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the young is unique, with a distinct set of pathophysiologic factors that influence disease onset, response to treatment, and prognosis. AF in the young remains relatively uncommon, and a detailed clinical assessment is crucial to ensuring optimal outcomes. Where relevant, genetic assessment is an important element of management. Catheter ablation remains effective for AF in the young, particularly when nonpulmonary vein triggers are present. Improved understanding of AF in the young is important to ensuring good long-term outcomes.",
