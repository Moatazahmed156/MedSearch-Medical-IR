    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Xanthogranulomatous prostatitis is a rare, noncancerous inflammatory condition of the prostate that clinically resembles prostatic carcinoma, necessitating a pathological examination for accurate diagnosis.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      A 75-year-old Egyptian male presented with urinary symptoms and an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen. Initial clinical and imaging findings suggested a locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate. However, histopathological examination after transurethral resection of the prostate revealed severe xanthogranulomatous prostatitis on a background of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Xanthogranulomatous prostatitis can present with symptoms and radiological findings and biochemical markers similar to those of prostatic carcinoma. Accurate diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis requires a high level of suspicion and close collaboration with a pathologist.",
