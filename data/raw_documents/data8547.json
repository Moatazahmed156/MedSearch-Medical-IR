    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Determining whether systemic corticosteroids impair wound healing is a clinically relevant topic that has important management implications.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We reviewed literature on the effects of corticosteroids on wound healing from animal and human studies searching MEDLINE from 1949 to 2011.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Some animal studies show a 30% reduction in wound tensile strength with perioperative corticosteroids at 15 to 40 mg/kg/day. The preponderance of human literature found that high-dose corticosteroid administration for <10 days has no clinically important effect on wound healing. In patients taking chronic corticosteroids for at least 30 days before surgery, their rates of wound complications may be increased 2 to 5 times compared with those not taking corticosteroids. Complication rates may vary depending on dose and duration of steroid use, comorbidities, and types of surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Acute, high-dose systemic corticosteroid use likely has no clinically significant effect on wound healing, whereas chronic systemic steroids may impair wound healing in susceptible individuals.",
