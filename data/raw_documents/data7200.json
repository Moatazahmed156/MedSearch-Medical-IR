    "abstract": "The current progress in sequencing of genomes and characterization of new species provides an increasing list of yeasts that show interesting physiological properties; however, the lack of expression tools for these new hosts is prohibiting their broader use in research or industry. Recently, we developed a universal expression system (SES) functional in broad spectrum of fungal species, which represent a solution for feasible gene expression control and genetic manipulation in these novel hosts. Here, we describe three example approaches for DNA transformation and high-level heterologous gene expression, using the SES system, in three yeast species, where minimal knowledge or prior experience in genetic modifications is available.",
