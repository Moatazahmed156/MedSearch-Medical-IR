    "abstract": "Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease can lead to many clinical syndromes. One syndrome simulates rheumatoid arthritis and is thus called \"pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis.\" Since some patients have true rheumatoid arthritis with CPPD crystal deposition disease, the clinician may have difficulty differentiating those patients from others who have the pseudo-rheumatoid syndrome. Such a diagnostic problem can be solved radiographically. Eleven patients with CPPD crystal deposition disease were studied; five had true rheumatoid arthritis and six had pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis. Because osseous erosions were not apparent in the arthropathy of uncomplicated CPPD crystal deposition disease, the detection of skeletal erosive changes indicated a true rheumatoid arthritis process.",
