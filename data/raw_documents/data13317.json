  "title": "Neuroprotective Effects of PEP-1-PGAM5 via the Attenuation of Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in Parkinson's Disease.",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is driven by mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress-induced dopaminergic cell death. Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) augmented accelerating mitophagy and attenuating neuronal apoptosis. Here, we present a novel cell-penetrating PEP-1-PGAM5 fusion protein designed to suppress oxidative damage and apoptosis. We assessed its transduction efficiency and neuroprotective efficacy in vitro and in vivo. PEP-1-PGAM5 was efficiently transduced into SH-SY5Y cells without cytotoxicity. In MPP",
