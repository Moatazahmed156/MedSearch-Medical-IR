    "abstract": "Around 1 in 5 people with coronary artery disease has major depression and the prognosis in heart disease is worse in those who are also depressed.

Here, we consider whether any of the commonly used antidepressants are more or less likely to exacerbate heart disease and whether treatment for depression affects cardiac outcomes.",
