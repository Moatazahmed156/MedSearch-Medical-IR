There are no many published literature available documenting the effectiveness of Ayurveda intervention on diabetes mellitus.

The patient had classical symptoms of diabetes mellitus viz. excessive thirst, fatigue and frequent urination. His fasting blood glucose level was 346 mg/dl and post prandial glucose level of 511 mg/dl. Further more his HbA1C was as high as 14.87%, thus diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Based on his specific clinical symptoms the patient was diagnosed with kaphaja prameha. Treatment was given according to classical Ayurveda intervention for kaphaja prameha. The patient responded well to the treatment. His HbA1C reduced to 6.05% in a span of eight months. The case report shows the effectiveness of Ayurvedic intervention in diabetes mellitus.
