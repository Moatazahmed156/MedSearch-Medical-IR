    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Hearing loss is a growing public health issue that significantly impacts both health-related quality of life and working life. This study investigates how hearing rehabilitation with bone conduction hearing implants impacts health-related quality of life and working life in adults of working age with hearing impairment.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      This longitudinal study used data from Cochlear's Implant Recipient Observational Study to assess hearing disabilities and job satisfaction in 18-65-year-old recipients of bone conduction hearing implants. Baseline data were collected pre-implantation and patients were followed-up at 12-months post-implantation.\n    \n\n\n          Study sample:\n        \n      \n      Patient demographics, Health Utilities Index Mark 3, the Speech Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale, and self-reported employment data are presented for a sample ranging from 30 to 43 patients, pre-implantation and at 12-months follow-up following implantation with a bone conduction hearing implant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Significant improvements in hearing and speech attribute, and overall health-related quality of life were observed between pre-and post-implantation. Overall hearing disability decreased post-implantation and job satisfaction improved.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Hearing rehabilitation using bone conduction hearing implants are shown to improve health-related quality of life, reduce hearing disability, and improve work performance and satisfaction. Results are representative of healthy and actively working users of bone conduction hearing implants.",
