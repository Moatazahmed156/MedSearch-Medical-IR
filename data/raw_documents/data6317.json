    "abstract": "The present review addresses strategies to preserve prostate health, tackling the three most common prostatic problems with which men present to physicians, namely, prostate hypertrophy, prostatitis and prostate cancer. Unfortunately since a clear etiology does not exist for each of these problems, we have to rely on experimental research, epidemiologic and clinical data to design prevention strategies. A number of modifiable targets have been identified and some are cross-shared between these three very prevalent entities. However, since the pathogenesis of each condition seems multifactorial, and the interconnections between them inadequately understood, chemopreventive strategies are still in their infancy even after very large clinical trials -which produced often more questions than they delivered answers- have already been performed.",
