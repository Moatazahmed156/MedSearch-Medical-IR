  "title": "Professionals' perspectives on factors influencing adherence to inhaler medication in patients with COPD and Asthma: A qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "This qualitative study aimed to explore the factors that influence inhaler adherence in patients with COPD and asthma from perspectives of respiratory healthcare professionals. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with respiratory healthcare professionals in three tertiary hospitals in Southwest China. The transcribed text data were analyzed using Nvivo11 software and summarized using the three levels of coding of Grounded Theory to derive qualitative findings. The findings were further analyzed and categorized according to the Andersen model. The influencing factors on patients' adherence to inhaler medication can be categorized into three dimensions: contextual characteristics (accessibility of inhalers; support and supervision; disease and medication-related education), individual characteristics (patients' understanding of their diseases and inhalers; patients' comprehension of inhaler usage; affordability of inhalers; type of disease; duration of inhaler usage), and outcomes (effectiveness of inhalers; symptoms of discomfort while using inhalers). Adherence to inhaler medication in patients with asthma and COPD can be influenced by contextual characteristics, individual characteristics and medication outcomes. Effective management necessitates a collaborative approach involving the entire healthcare community. Robust recommendations for adherence interventions include government subsidies for inhalers, ensuring inhaler availability, active collaboration, personalized treatment plans, and effective patient self-management.",
