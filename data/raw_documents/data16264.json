  "title": "The role of virus in nasal inflammation.",
  "abstract": "Viral infection is an important pathogenic factor contributing to chronic inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus are among the most common viral pathogens associated with nasal diseases. These viruses enter host epithelial cells through distinct receptors. In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis, disruption of the physiological balance of the nasal and sinus epithelium increases susceptibility to viral infection. Meanwhile, viral infection can enhance type 2 inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyper-responsiveness, tissue remodeling, and ultimately contribute to the persistence of chronic inflammation. In addition, viruses can induce nasal epithelial cells, innate immune cells, and tissue-resident memory T cells to develop local immune memory, amplifying secondary inflammatory responses. Viral infection may also predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections, further exacerbating inflammation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of respiratory viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, in the pathogenesis of nasal inflammation and to provide new insights into its etiology and potential therapeutic targets.",
