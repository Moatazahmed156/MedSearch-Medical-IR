  "title": "Ultra-processed foods and CKD: a review of evidence, limitations, and future directions.",
  "abstract": "To critically examine the emerging evidence linking ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption to chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a particular focus on prevention strategies, biological mechanisms, and implications for dietary guidelines and public health policy. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently report a positive association between high UPF consumption and CKD risk. Mechanistic insights suggest roles for food additives, altered nutrient bioavailability, and inflammatory pathways, while omics-based studies offer preliminary biomarker candidates. The KDIGO 2024 guidelines now emphasize dietary interventions, including reduced UPF consumption, as a core component of CKD management. The findings support limiting UPF consumption as part of CKD prevention strategies. Nonetheless, the evidence base is largely derived from overlapping observational studies, with limited original research published in the considered timeframe. Moreover, the scarcity of recent original studies, methodological inconsistencies in UPF classification and CKD outcome definitions, highlight the urgent need for further research and standardization of approaches. Integrating precision nutrition and validated biomarkers into nephrology could enhance individualized dietary recommendations and public health interventions.",
