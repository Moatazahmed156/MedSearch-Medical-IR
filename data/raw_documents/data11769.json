  "title": "Gut Microbiota in the Regulation of Intestinal Drug Transporters: Molecular Mechanisms and Pharmacokinetic Implications.",
  "abstract": "Gut microbiota, through both its species composition and its metabolites, impacts expression and activity of intestinal drug transporters. This phenomenon directly affects absorption process of orally administered drugs and contributes to the observed inter-individual variability in pharmacotherapeutic responses. This review summarizes mechanistic evidence from in vitro and animal studies and integrates clinical observations in which alterations in gut microbiota are associated with changes in oral drug exposure, consistent with potential regulation of key intestinal drug transporters-such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP, ABCG2), MRP2/3 proteins (ABCC2/3), and selected Organic Anion-Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs, e.g., SLCO1A2, SLCO2B1)-by major bacterial metabolites including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), secondary bile acids, and tryptophan-derived indoles. The molecular mechanisms involved include activation of nuclear and membrane receptors (PXR, FXR, AhR, TGR5), modulation of transcriptional and stress-response pathways (Nrf2, AP-1) with simultaneous suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways (NF-κB), and post-translational modifications (e.g., direct inhibition of P-gp ATPase activity by ",
