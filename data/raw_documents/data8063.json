    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Plantar fasciopathy is the most common cause of acquired sub-calcaneal heel pain in adults. To-date, research of this condition has mainly focused on management rather than causal mechanisms. The aetiology of plantar fasciopathy is likely to be multifactorial, as both intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors have been reported. The purpose of this review is to critically reevaluate risk factors for plantar fasciopathy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A detailed literature review was undertaken using English language medical databases.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No clear consensus exists as to the relative strength of the risk factors reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      To-date numerous studies have examined various intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors implicated in the aetiology of plantar fasciopathy. How these factors interact may provide useful data to establish an individuals' risk profile for plantar fasciopathy and their potential for response to treatment. Further research is indicated to rank the relative significance of these risk factors.",
