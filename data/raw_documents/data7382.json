    "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells have increasingly important roles in many different fields of research and medicine. Major areas of impact include improved in vitro disease models, drug screening, and the development of cell-based clinical therapies. Here, we review the generation and uses of embryonic stem cells compared to induced pluripotent stem cells and discuss their advantages and limitations. We also evaluate the feasibility of clinical therapies and the future prospects for induced pluripotent cell-based treatments.",
