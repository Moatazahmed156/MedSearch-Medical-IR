  "title": "Prescription Patterns and Associated Factors of SGLT2 Inhibitors Use Among Patients Worldwide: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Real-World Studies.",
  "abstract": "The prescribing patterns of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in real-world clinical practice remain inadequately characterized. To address this gap, this meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence on the prescription trends and clinical factors associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease. Studies that were conducted to assess SGLT2 inhibitor use among patients were screened. From its inception until November 4, 2024, searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4 and Stata 18.0. The study examined data from 102 studies, revealing a compelling global prevalence of SGLT2 inhibitors of 12% (95% CI, 11%-13%). The pooled prevalence of SGLT2 inhibitor use was 13% (95% CI, 11%-14%) in patients with cardiovascular disease, followed by type 2 diabetes at 12% (95% CI, 11%-13%) and chronic kidney disease at 11% (95% CI, 9%-13%). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors was significantly higher in patients who were enrolled after December 2020 compared with those enrolled before that date (20% vs 9%). The prescribing of SGLT2 inhibitors is significantly related to age, sex, body mass index, Medicare, and endocrinology visits. The meta-analysis indicates that the real-world use of SGLT2 inhibitors increased gradually up to 2020. The synthesized evidence revealed variations in usage across different patient subgroups, which require addressing the identified barriers in the future to ensure optimal prescribing.",
