    "abstract": "Complex analysis of changes in clinical, laboratory and ultrasound manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis revealed relationships between the pathologic process activity, the disease duration, its X-ray stage and ultrasound signs. Manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by predominant proliferation and exudation in soft tissues inside joints, tendopathies, chondral plate alterations as hyaline destruction. Articular cartilage erosions can be seen even in 2.8 months after destructive arthritis manifestation. Diagnostic criteria of early rheumatoid arthritis are: articular disorders location, articular syndrome variant (mono-, oligo- and polyarthritic; seropositiveness on rheumatoid factor andACCP), chondral plate state according to ultrasound examination.",
