  "title": "Sphingolipids as indicators of exposure to long-term air pollution: a targeted metabolomics approach.",
  "abstract": "Metabolomic changes related to air pollution have been previously reported, including sphingolipid metabolism; however, evidence from long-term exposures assessed with long-term exposure using targeted metabolomics remains limited. We profiled plasma sphingolipids and amino acids in 188 individuals from the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Dusty Areas cohort. Annual average concentrations of particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM",
