    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Stem-cell research is being investigated for the treatment of retina diseases. Cell replacement strategies have the potential to improve vision in patients who were previously considered to be untreatable. This review summarizes progress within the field and obstacles which must be overcome to make stem-cell therapy a viable treatment for select retinal disease.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Researchers have demonstrated that stem-cell transplants can survive, migrate, differentiate, and integrate within the retina. Stem cells from various developmental stages have been used in these experiments, including embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, retinal stem cells, and adult stem cells from the ciliary margin. Not only can these transplants adopt retina-like morphologies and phenotypes, but they have also shown evidence of synaptic reconnection and visual recovery in both animal and human studies. Still, work must be done to achieve higher yields of functioning retinal neurons and to promote better integration within the host retina.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Although many obstacles remain, stem-cell-based therapy is a promising treatment to restore vision in patients with retina disease.",
