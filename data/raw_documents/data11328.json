  "title": "Metallomic Aspects of Stroke and Recovery: ICP-MS Study with Chemometric Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet the contribution of elemental imbalance to its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Experimental evidence suggests that disturbances in the concentrations of essential and toxic elements contribute to neuronal injury through excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In this study, we examined regional concentration in 15 elements (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, Cr, V, Pb, Al, B) in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent MCAO or sham surgery, after which the contralateral cortex, dorsal striatum, and hippocampus were collected seven days post-surgery. Elemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and analyzed by Student's ",
