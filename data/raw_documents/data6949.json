    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Sleep plays an integral role in several physiologic functions such as cognition and functional ability. Sleep disturbances are common after brain injury and can interfere with rehabilitation and recovery. There are several pathways by which sleep is initiated, and thus various ways to target common complaints as well.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To review alternative and non-pharmacological treatment approaches to sleep disorders following TBI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The authors present a review of the literature on various alternative treatment methods for treating sleep disorders, and discuss evidence for safety and efficacy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Typical management include conservative measures and pharmacologic treatment. This article provides a review of the available nonpharmacologic treatment options for sleep disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury. There are a number of non-pharmacological treatment methods available for treatment of sleep disorders in this population.",
