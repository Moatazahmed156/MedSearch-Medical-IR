    "abstract": "To analyze the characteristics of ovarian necrosis in the neonatal ovarian tumor, and review treatments for ovarian torsion in neonates. Neonates with ovarian tumors undergoing surgery in Fujian Maternal and Child Health Hospital (Fujian Children's Hospital) from February 2016 to August 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into the ovarian necrosis group and control group (without necrosis). Demographic characteristics, prenatal and postnatal examination, operation, and pathological findings were compared and the relevant factors of ovarian necrosis were discussed. 26 neonates were included, 12 in necrosis group and 14 in control group. The maximum diameter of the tumor in necrosis group was smaller than that in control group (P < 0.01). The preoperative CRP in necrosis group was significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between two groups in the timeliness of surgery, pathological types, and length of postoperative hospital stay. About 26% of neonatal ovarian torsion could be rescued. Neonatal ovarian necrosis is characterized by a smaller tumor size and a higher preoperative CRP level. Timely surgery after birth might not change the ovarian outcome, but ovarian detorsion could be attempted in neonates to save residual ovarian function.",
