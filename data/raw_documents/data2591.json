    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI), a common clinical infectious disease, is marked by high incidence and frequent recurrence. Recurrent UTIs can cause severe complications, negatively affecting health. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria present significant challenges to UTI treatment. This article systematically reviews the key immune mechanisms in the body's defense against UTI pathogens. It discusses various immune response components, such as the urinary tract mucosal epithelium, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, innate lymphocytes, T cells, and B cells, with the aim of providing insights for future UTI research.",
