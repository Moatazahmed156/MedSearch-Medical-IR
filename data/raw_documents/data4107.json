    "abstract": "Patients with septic arthritis are observed regularly in daily hospital practice, and most patients have a clearly confirmed diagnosis. Here, we present a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in silent septic shock. Following careful clinical examination and identification of the infection source, the culprit lesion was drained. This case report highlights a history of falls as a sign of silent septic arthritis. Diagnostic knee taps should be performed when silent sepsis is suspected as clinical symptoms may be masked and not always be discernable in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.",
