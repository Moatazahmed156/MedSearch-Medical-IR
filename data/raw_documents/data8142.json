    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a complex central nervous system disease with an unsatisfactory prognosis, often accompanied by multiple pathological processes. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of this disease are unclear, and there are no suitable targeted therapeutic options. Long non-coding RNA mediates a variety of neurological diseases and regulates various biological processes, including apoptosis and autophagy, inflammatory response, microenvironment, and oxidative stress. It is known that long non-coding RNAs have significant differences in gene expression in spinal cord injury. To further understand the mechanism of long non-coding RNA action in spinal cord injury and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies regarding spinal cord injury, this review outlines the current status of research between long non-coding RNAs and spinal cord injury and potential long non-coding RNAs targeting spinal cord injury.",
