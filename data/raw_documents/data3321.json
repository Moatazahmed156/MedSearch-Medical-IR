    "abstract": "Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Case example and review of clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews provide relevant data regarding the management of herpes zoster.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Herpes zoster is a relatively common disease in elderly patients. It results from reactivation of varicella zoster virus (chickenpox). Characteristic vesicular lesions are often accompanied by significant acute pain. The risk of complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), increases when patients age or are inadequately treated.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      Appropriate diagnosis and management of herpes zoster may shorten the overall disease course, accelerate cutaneous healing, and reduce the risk of PHN, a chronically painful complication. Greater understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and available treatment options is essential for nurse practitioners and other primary care providers to initiate early treatment in patients with suspected herpes zoster infection.",
