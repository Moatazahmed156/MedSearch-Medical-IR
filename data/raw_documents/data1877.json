    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Significant evidence exists supporting the use of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as a primary curative approach in locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer (HNSCC). Despite these aggressive protocols, 70% of patients die within 5 years because of locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis. To increase the response and survival of patients with HNSCC, CRT has been combined with molecular agents targeting distinct kinases.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study was performed using a systematic literature review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The effect of targeted therapy on patient survival in the context of CRT remains controversial, with toxicities tending to be more severe but still acceptable.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Supplementing CRT with target therapeutics might only improve survival in some patients with locally advanced HNSCC. Therefore, future studies must address the underlying biological mechanisms that can have an impact on treatment response. Such knowledge is essential in order to facilitate the effective and personalized treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC by combining CRT and targeted therapy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
