  "title": "A cost-benefit analysis of adult immunization programs across ten countries: Modeling the socioeconomic value of immunization for older populations compared to no vaccination.",
  "abstract": "Globally aging demographics necessitate proactive public health interventions like adult immunization programs, but comprehensive estimates of their socioeconomic value are lacking or narrow in perspective, risking suboptimal decision-making. To estimate the socioeconomic value of adult immunization programs for influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and respiratory syncytial virus across ten countries. Benefit-cost analysis using static disease models and a reference case framework to quantify net monetary benefits of immunization programs using different monetization approaches for non-monetary benefits. Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, US. Based on the lowest and highest valuations of non-monetary benefits, across all immunization programs, the mean benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) ranged from 5 to 19, suggesting substantial positive returns. Mortality-focused disease programs like influenza (BCRs 6-22) and pneumococcal disease (BCRs 15-33) showed the highest returns. The emerging respiratory syncytial virus program also demonstrated high potential positive returns (BCRs 6-16). Herpes zoster programs which primarily affect quality of life also yielded positive returns with BCRs of 2-4. Across all data points, 95% of estimated BCRs exceeded the cost-neutral 1.0 threshold. Adult immunization programs for influenza, pneumococcal disease, respiratory syncytial virus and herpes zoster consistently show positive returns on investment across a diversity of countries. Funding these programs provides long-term benefits and may help to mitigate upcoming global demographic challenges.",
