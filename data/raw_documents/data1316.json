    "abstract": "Direct treatment of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation--that is, attempting to prevent arrhythmia recurrences by ablating atrial tissue--has been a challenge because of uncertainty about the location of optimal target tissues as well as the amount of atrial tissue requiring destruction to effect cure. Advances have yielded success rates for ablation of the common form of atrial flutter comparable to those for other types of supraventricular tachycardia and provide reason for optimism about the use of catheter techniques, to treat atrial fibrillation definitively. This article discusses some of these advances as well as the current status of catheter ablation for atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation and, finally, what the future may bring.",
