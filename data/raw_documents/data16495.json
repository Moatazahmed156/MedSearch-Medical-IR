  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the detrimental potential of zoonotic coronavirus transmission to human populations. Effective vaccines capable of eliciting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 have been pivotal in mitigating the spread of the virus. In this study, we describe the generation of a non-replicating pseudotyped influenza A virus (S-FLU), where the native haemagglutinin (HA) sequence is replaced with the coding sequence of either a membrane-anchored form (TM) or secretory form (Sec) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan (S-RBD Wuhan). We showed that both S-RBD-TM and S-RBD-Sec viruses can be generated via reverse genetics and grown to high titre. Intranasal immunisation in mice with S-RBD-TM elicits robust serum binding and neutralisation activity against SARS-CoV-2, superior to S-RBD-Sec. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a heterologous prime-boost immunisation regime in mice with S-RBD-TM Wuhan and S-RBD-TM BM48-31 (a distant Clade 3 SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus)) increases antibody breadth against mismatched sarbecoviruses compared to homologous prime-boost with S-RBD-TM Wuhan. These results suggest that S-RBD-TM is a promising intranasal vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 and may offer potential as a broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine.",
