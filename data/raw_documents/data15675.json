  "title": "Evidence from COVID-19 Patients and Murine Studies for a Continuing Trend Towards Targeting of Nasopharyngeal Ciliated Epithelial Cells by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Sublineages.",
  "abstract": "We describe RNA-Seq analyses conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 37 patients admitted to an Australian intensive care unit from October 2022 to August 2023. During this time, the dominant omicron sublineage infections broadly progressed from BA.5 to BA.2-like, to XBB-like, then XBC, consistent with global trends. Viral load and patient metadata correlations indicated this cohort was broadly representative of severe COVID-19 patients. Human gene expression analyses were complicated by the large range (>5 log) and variability in viral reads. Nevertheless, the comparison of XBC and BA.5 samples that had comparable viral read counts, revealed differentially expressed genes and a cellular deconvolution signature that indicated increased targeting of ciliated epithelial cells by XBC. To obtain more evidence for increased targeting of ciliated epithelial cells by the later omicron sublineage viruses, a series of mouse strains were infected with a BA.5 or a XBB isolate. Increased infection of the nasal turbinates and ciliated epithelial cells by XBB was demonstrated by viral titrations and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with previous lineages, the omicron lineage showed increased targeting of ciliated epithelia in the upper respiratory tract, with the data presented herein suggesting this trend continued for the omicron sublineages.",
