    "abstract": "Respiratory symptoms and infections are common among athletes. Viral upper respiratory infection symptoms may precede dyspneic symptoms seen in asthmatics or worsen symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction Knowing how to instruct an athlete on use of inhalers and having an asthma action plan are critical in management of these athletes. Other life-threatening conditions that may be seen are pneumothorax and laryngeal/pharyngeal perforation. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial if an athlete is suspected to have pulmonary compromise. Laryngeal/pharyngeal perforations are a rare cause of issues within the training room but require a high degree of suspicion to be diagnosed and managed properly.",
