    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation, have been implicated in a wide range of diseases including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. The role of dietary folate in providing methyl groups required for maintenance and modulation of DNA methylation makes it a nutrient of interest in Alzheimer's. Late onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and at present its aetiology is largely undetermined. From epidemiological studies, the interactions between folate, B-vitamins and homocysteine as well as the long latency period has led to difficulties in interpretation of the data, thus current evidence exploring the role of dietary folate in Alzheimer's is contradictory and unresolved. Therefore, examining the effects at a molecular level and exploring potential epigenetic mechanisms could increase our understanding of the disease and aetiology. The aim of this review is to examine the role that folate could play in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and will focus on the effects of folate on DNA methylation which link to disease pathology, initiation and progression.",
