    "abstract": "In the recently established Molecular Toxicology laboratory at the Institute for Chemistry and Bioanalytics of the School of Life Sciences in the FHNW, we aim to develop and apply in vitro models for the investigation of toxic effects, with a primary focus on liver and kidney. In collaboration with other institutions, we are developing multicellular type 2D and 3D cell culture assays to be able to closely mimic relevant in vivo situations. In parallel we are broadening the choice of available endpoint analyses.",
