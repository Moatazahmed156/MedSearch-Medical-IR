    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as PD(L)1 and CTLA4 antibodies as well as targeted therapies such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors have significantly improved the systemic treatment of skin cancer in adjuvant and advanced therapy settings. All these drugs differ in their spectrum of side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the spectrum of side effects of dermato-oncological therapies and their management, taking into account the current literature.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The most important side effects of ICIs, the CCR4 inhibitor mogamulizumab, the ImmTAC tebentafusp, the BRAF and MEK inhibitors and the multityrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib are considered.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Side effects can manifest themselves in all organ systems. Chronic side effects and long-term harm are possible, especially with ICIs, and require close therapy monitoring and patient education. Knowledge of the side effects and the temporal, sometimes delayed course of their occurrence are essential for diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy.",
