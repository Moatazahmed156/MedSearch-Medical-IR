    "abstract": "The heart's continuous motion makes it difficult to capture high-resolution images of this organ in vivo. We developed tools based on high-speed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), offering pristine views into the beating zebrafish heart. We captured three-dimensional cardiac dynamics with postacquisition synchronization of multiview movie stacks, obtained static high-resolution reconstructions by briefly stopping the heart with optogenetics and resolved nonperiodic phenomena by high-speed volume scanning with a liquid lens.",
