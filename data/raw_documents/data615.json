    "abstract": "The marginal zone of the B follicle represents a well-defined compartment of the B area. Its cellular composition is distinct from that of the follicle centre, from which it also differs in its functional role in the immune response. Several newly identified lymphoma entities, e.g. extranodal MALT type lymphoma, nodal monocytoid B-cell lymphoma and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, display in common a very peculiar organoid growth pattern reminiscent of the marginal zone. Moreover, their neoplastic components share morphologic and phenotypic similarities to the cellular components of the marginal zone. The clinical characteristics of these various marginal zone cell lymphomas may differ depending of the organ which is involved. Nevertheless, they all share common cytogenetic abnormalities suggesting a common pathogenesis.",
