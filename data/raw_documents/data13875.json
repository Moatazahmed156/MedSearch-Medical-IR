  "abstract": "Siwei Zangmu Xiang (SWZMX) Decoction powder is a classical Tibetan prescription used for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SWZMX has been widely used in clinical practice due to its potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. However, as a multi-component Tibetan medicine formula, its bioactive constituents and mechanisms of action in RA have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study sought to reveal the active components in SWZMX and to explore its underlying mechanism of action on RA. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was used to profile the bioactive constituents of SWZMX. Network pharmacology was utilized to screen for RA-related molecular targets. The anti-inflammatory effects of SWZMX were then validated in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of SWZMX was further evaluated in IL1RA A total of 731 active constituents were identified in SWZMX. These constituents were predicted to act on RA primarily through the RAGE signaling pathway and exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages in vitro. Micro-CT analysis revealed that SWZMX markedly reduced ankle deformity and attenuated bone mineral density loss in IL1RA SWZMX aqueous extract alleviated synovial inflammation and bone damage in RA mice by suppressing the release of IL-6 and TNF-α through regulating the RAGE signaling pathway.",
