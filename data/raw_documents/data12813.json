  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics remain a challenge due to their complex pathology and multifactorial toxicity. Advanced stages of AD are marked by rapid cognitive decline, driven by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. We report the design of dual-active, prodrug-like multifunctional modulators by conjugating papaverine with butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) with neuroprotective properties. The lead compound, ",
