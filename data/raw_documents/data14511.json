  "abstract": "The acute effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors, SGLT2i, has never been investigated in non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients. SGL-TX-MR will investigate the acute effects of SGLT2 inhibitor on kidney allograft oxygen tension in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial. Eight non-diabetic-KTR, adults, more than 6 months post-transplant with a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate > 20 ml/min, recruited from Odense University Hospital, Kidney Transplant Outpatient Clinic, from 2025 to 2026, will be randomized to a double blind crossover intervention with a single dose 50 mg Jardiance, SGLT2i, or placebo in random order, separated by a 2-week wash-out period. kidney transplant cortical and medullary oxygen tension, estimated by blood oxygen level dependent-magnetic resonance imaging-based renal T2* relaxation rate. Secondary endpoint: Renal cortical and medullary perfusion, renal artery blood flow, blood glucose, blood pressure, and heart rate. We will investigate if a single dose of SGLT2i improves renal cortical oxygenation within 3 and 6 h from admission in non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients. This finding will improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind the impressive renoprotective effects recently seen with SGLT2i in major clinical trials with non-transplant chronic kidney disease patients and provide new horizons for therapeutic treatments targeting hypoxia in renal allograft.
