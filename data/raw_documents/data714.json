    "abstract": "In recent years, efforts in the field of public mental health have increased that seek to promote mental health and mental health literacy at population level and yield advances in the prevention, treatment and care of mental health conditions. This paper provides an overview of contemporary conceptualisations of indicators and determinants of public mental health as well as population-based intervention strategies from an international perspective. Current conceptual and methodological challenges of so-called high-risk, whole-population and vulnerable population strategies are critically discussed. Future efforts in research, policy and practice need to address fundamental causes of social and health inequalities, drawing on all societal fields, to contribute to improving population mental health.",
