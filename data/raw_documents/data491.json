    "abstract": "Although healthy life expectancy is projected to be increasing among older people in Ghana, a high proportion and number of older people will live with functional disability, warranting their need for long-term care. We explored the expressions used by older people to describe their needs and preference of care and support. Using the descriptive qualitative approach, 14 older people were engaged via semi-structured interviews, and the data were analysed thematically. The study found that older people desired a decent accommodation, preferential healthcare, adequate nutrition, and an opportunity to interact with their peers at social functions. A provision of sufficient financial assistance, adequate healthcare, the periodic organisation of social and group events for older people, and the availability of home care and support could help older people address these needs. The paper reveals the need for interventional research on how a model incorporating social, health and environmental factors even during a pandemic can address older people's varying needs.",
