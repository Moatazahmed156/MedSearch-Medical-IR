  "abstract": "Global seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents has risen to an estimated 56.6%. Limited data on children highlights the need for ongoing surveillance as recommended by the WHO. Understanding this need, in this study we carry out a feasibility study of a rapid lateral flow immunoassay test (LFIAT) and determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and adolescents. The method used in the paper included 202 children (1-18 years old) who were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies using the LFIAT. LFIAT provides results in 20 min. Demographic data was collected through questionnaires. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was 52.0% (n = 105). No gender differences were observed. Adolescents exhibited higher seroprevalence (63.0%) compared to children aged 1-5.9 (49.3%) and 6-11.9 years old (46.8%), without statistical significance (",
