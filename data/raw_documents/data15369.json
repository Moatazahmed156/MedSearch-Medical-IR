  "title": "Synthesis, antitubercular activity and computational studies of click-tethered phosphonium salts.",
  "abstract": "This study reports the synthesis of a library comprising three series of 21 phosphonium salt hybrids (1a-1 g, 2a-2 g, 3a-3 g) generated via a click reaction yielding 1, 2, 3-triazoles with potential antitubercular activity. The phosphonium salts were synthesized through a 1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition (click) reaction. The structures of all synthesized compounds were elucidated using ",
