  "title": "Diagnostically challenging ligneous conjunctivitis with confirmed ",
  "abstract": "This study reports the ocular and systemic manifestations, genetic findings, and management approaches in 10 patients diagnosed with ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) and followed at a university hospital. In this retrospective case series, medical records were retrospectively reviewed to collect demographic characteristics, age at diagnosis, family history, serum plasminogen (PLG) activity levels, ocular/systemic findings, and treatment modalities. Ten patients (7 females, 3 males; age range: 2-40 years) were followed for a mean duration of 9.4 ± 5.5 years. PLG activity was markedly reduced (18-25%) in six individuals. Systemic comorbidities included hydrocephalus ( The diagnosis of LC is based on the integration of clinical and genetic findings, characterized by recurrent, firm pseudomembranes on the tarsal conjunctiva and often supported by a positive family history or parental consanguinity. Reduced PLG activity, histopathological confirmation of fibrin-rich membranes, and supportive genetic findings further substantiate the diagnosis.",
