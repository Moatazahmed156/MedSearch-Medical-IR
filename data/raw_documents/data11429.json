  "title": "A Review on the Role of Oral Bacteria in Stroke.",
  "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests periodontitis may contribute to stroke risk via vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, promoting atherothrombosis and atrial fibrillation. This review aims to synthesize the evidence on the presence of oral bacteria and their products in biological samples from stroke patients and assess their potential impact on stroke pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and prognosis. We conducted a narrative review of epidemiological, serological, and molecular studies examining the presence of oral bacterial DNA, endotoxins and antibodies against oral pathogens in biological samples (blood, saliva and thrombi) from stroke patients. Seropositivity for periodontal pathogens in blood was associated with incident stroke, as well as with poorer prognosis. Oral bacterial DNA, mainly from ",
