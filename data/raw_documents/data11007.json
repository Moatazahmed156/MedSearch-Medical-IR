  "title": "The effect of training given to patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in line with the Health Promotion Model on self-efficacy: a randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the training given to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients in line with Health Promotion Model (HPM) on the self-efficacy level of the individual. This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with patients hospitalized in the chest diseases intensive care unit of a state hospital. The study was conducted with 140 patients (intervention group = 70, control group = 70). The intervention group received four sessions of training prepared in line with the HPM. Self-efficacy was assessed with the COPD Self-Efficacy Scale. The self-efficacy levels of those in the intervention group increased significantly after the intervention compared with before the intervention, while the mean scores of those in the control group decreased significantly. The post-test self-efficacy scale scores of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. In this study, the training applied to individuals with COPD in line with HPM was effective in increasing the self-efficacy level of individuals. After the training, the competence level of individuals in managing respiratory distress increased significantly, while in the control group, which did not receive any intervention, the competence level in managing respiratory distress decreased in 3 months.",
