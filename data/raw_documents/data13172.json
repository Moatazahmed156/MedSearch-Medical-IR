  "abstract": "Increasing evidence has linked sleep quality and sleep apnea to poorer brain health, yet the association between sleep macro-architecture, nocturnal hypoxemia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related patterns on neuroimaging remains less known, especially across older adults from diverse ethnoracial groups. The recently completed Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD)-Dormir Study recruited community-dwelling non-Hispanic White (NHW), Hispanic, and Black participants who underwent an in-home sleep apnea assessment (WatchPAT, Itamar, IS) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate sleep and AD-related MRI biomarkers. Sleep stages were estimated using a validated proprietary algorithm. Our primary outcomes are AD-signature cortical thickness (in individual regions of interests, including entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus, N = 636) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume [log(WMH+1), normalized by intracranial volume, and categorized into tertiles, N = 842]. We applied multivariable linear or ordinal regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, body mass index, cognitive status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and MRI scanner. A total of 842 elderly participants [34% male; 42% NHW, 33% Hispanic and 25% Black; age 66.18.6 years] were included in the final analysis. Greater light sleep percentage and longer REM sleep latency were independently associated with thinner cortex in AD-signature regions: standardized β Light/deep sleep percentage, longer REM sleep latency, and nocturnal hypoxemia were associated with AD-related MRI patterns.",
