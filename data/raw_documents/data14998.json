  "title": "Hand Grip Strength as a Functional Marker of Sarcopenia in Liver Cirrhosis: Evidence from an Indian Cohort.",
  "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a frequent and prognostically significant complication of liver cirrhosis. Hand grip strength (HGS) has emerged as a simple, noninvasive tool for assessing muscle function, yet limited data exist on its utility in Indian cirrhotic populations. To evaluate the association of HGS with established prognostic scores and biochemical parameters in Indian patients with cirrhosis. In this cross-sectional observational study, 100 adult cirrhotic patients were assessed between August 2022 and December 2023. HGS was measured using a validated hand-held dynamometer. Correlations between HGS and clinical scores of severity of cirrhosis [Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)] and biochemical markers were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Mean patient age was 59.2 ± 8.46 years; 85% were male. The most common etiologies were alcohol (46%) and viral hepatitis (26%). HGS declined significantly with increasing liver disease severity: CTP A (34.0 ± 1.48 kg), B (21.63 ± 1.07 kg), and C (13.5 ± 2.87 kg) ( HGS is strongly associated with liver disease severity and key biochemical indicators. As a bedside, radiation-free tool, it offers a practical method for assessing sarcopenia in cirrhosis, especially in resource-limited settings.",
