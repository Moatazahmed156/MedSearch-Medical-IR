  "title": "Increased serum uric acid-to-urinary urate excretion ratio with the kidney function decline in male CKD patients without diabetes: a retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "The relationship between uric acid and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression remains unclear. To study the association between the serum uric acid-to-24-hour-urinary urate excretion ratio (SUER) and kidney events in patients experiencing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. A retrospective cohort study involving 165 CKD patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) between 15 and 150 mL/min/1.73 m The general population aged 56.45 ± 15.76 years, and of which 65 (39.39%) CKD patients are females. The SUER was not the risk of experiencing renal endpoint events in the overall population (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.680, 1.621; P = 0.826), but was an associated factor of renal endpoint events in males without diabetes (OR = 2.196; 95%CI:1.191,4.052; P = 0.012). An increased SUER may be an indicator for kidney function decline in male CKD patients without diabetes. Further studies should focus on subgroup analyses of CKD patients particularly in male CKD patients without diabetes to evaluate whether uric acid-lowering measures are warranted. Not applicable.",
