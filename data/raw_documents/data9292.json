  "title": "Canines Masticating on the Lower Extremity.",
  "abstract": "Clinicians caring for feet may be hearing stories of canines masticating the foot/digits on unsuspecting persons with diabetes and neuropathy. For the most part, these reports are anecdotal. Actual publications on this topic are scarce. The following discussion and case reports depict a typical presentation with a sleeping person with diabetic polyneuropathy and infection, which attracts the canine and results in tissue mastication. The workup and care for such clinical presentations appear straightforward and effective; however, the authors highly recommend that providers that care for persons with diabetes who own pets take precautions, especially during sleep.",
