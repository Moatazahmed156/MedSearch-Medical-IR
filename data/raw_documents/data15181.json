  "title": "Advanced strategies based on nanomedicine for Liver fibrosis treatment.",
  "abstract": "Liver fibrosis (LF) is a significant pathological manifestation in various types of chronic liver diseases andis associated withsubstantial global morbidity and mortality. While liver transplantation remains a treatment option,existing clinical pharmacological interventionsface limitations,highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. The emergence of nanobiotechnology has introduced nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems as a promising avenue for the treatment of liver-related ailments. This reviewsystematically categorizes and synthesizesthe diverse nanomaterials currently employed in themanagement of LF. It analyzesexisting nanoplatforms used for LF treatment, focusing on various mechanismsfor targeting and regulating specific cell types, including hepatic stellate cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. Additionally, strategiesfor regulating the fibrotic microenvironment, such as modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and degradationand mitigating inflammatory and oxidative stress, are explored. Finally, potential future directions and challenges for nanoparticle-based LF therapiesare discussed.",
