    "abstract": "Acquired ichthyosis (AI) in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare dermatologic finding, with only 7 previously published cases worldwide. We report a 25-year-old black woman with AI associated with SLE. A skin biopsy specimen from the lower extremity showed histologic changes consistent with both ichthyosis vulgaris and SLE, a unique finding that has not been previously reported. We also review the world literature on AI and SLE.",
