    "abstract": "Gene therapy is the treatment of a disease through transferring genetic material into cells of the patients. In the recent several years, gene therapy has experienced rapid progress and achieved huge success. Over two dozens of gene therapies have been approved for clinical use by the drug regulatory agencies from different countries. However, concerns about its efficacy and safety have accompanied gene therapy since its birth. In the present manuscript, we first introduce various strategies employed in gene therapy, which includes ex vivo gene delivery v.s. in vivo gene delivery; gene addition v.s. genome editing; inherited disease v.s. acquired disease; and somatic gene therapy v.s. germline gene therapy. Then we discuss the clinical outcomes of some approved gene therapies. We finish our discussion with the safety issues related to gene therapy. We will see that with the technology improvement, somatic gene therapy has been proved to be efficient and safe enough for clinical practice. However, germline gene therapy has important efficiency and safety issues at present, and should not be put into clinical practice before these issues are solved.",
