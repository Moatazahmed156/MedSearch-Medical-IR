    "abstract": "Gene therapy is a method for treating hereditary disease at the gene level. In this paper, I show recent gene therapy approaches for cancer, hemophilia and arteriosclerosis obliterans, and gene medical supply including antisense and decoys are also introduced. With the rapid advances in gene therapy research, the case of dying gene therapy using the adenovirus vector was reported due to DIC. Establishment of the safety in the gene therapy and solution of the ethics problems are also important issues.",
