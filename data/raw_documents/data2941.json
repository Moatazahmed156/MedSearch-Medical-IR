    "abstract": "Clinicians in the 1980s rely on the physical examination to a lesser degree than their predecessors in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The major criticisms are that the physical examination lacks sensitivity for many common diseases and has not been subjected to the same scientific scrutiny afforded laboratory testing. On the positive side, the physical examination is a series of diagnostic maneuvers that permit physicians to test hypotheses generated during history taking, to determine disease severity, and to lessen clinical uncertainty. Furthermore, the physical examination fosters the development of personalized medical care and a bond of mutual trust between patient and doctor. The challenge for tomorrow is to determine the operating characteristics of physical examination techniques and the clinical utility of physical findings. For preclinical students, emphasis should be directed at basic examination principles and sequencing. Many model programs have used patient instructors and other innovative techniques. Clinical students and postgraduate trainees need emphasis on interpretation of physical findings and their integration into the clinical context. There is no substitute for bedside teaching at this level.",
