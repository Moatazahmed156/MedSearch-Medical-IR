    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Dark circles under the eyes are a common condition worldwide with multiple treatment options. The aim of this paper is to report a case of dark circles treated with ozone therapy, which showed a very reasonable clinical improvement.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      A case of dark circles under the eyes treatment with ozone therapy concentrations and doses was reported. We searched MEDLINE treatment options for dark circles. Literature on this subject is scarce. CARE guidelines have been adopted for this case report.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ozone therapy is a really effective biostimulator, that reduces spots and wrinkles. In this case, the patient and healthcare professionals were satisfied with just two ozone therapy sessions. This is an interesting alternative treatment for this common condition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Ozone therapy is a safe, inexpensive, and quick treatment for dark circles under the eyes. It can be used alone or in combination with other methods.",
