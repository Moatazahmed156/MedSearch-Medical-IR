    "abstract": "Stress-induced prolonged inflammation impairs cutaneous wound healing. Exercise may inhibit this effect via an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Our aim was to investigate the effect of moderate exercise on skin wound healing in chronically stressed mice. Mice were trained five times per week on a treadmill or received no training. Mice underwent daily rotational stress from the 6th week until euthanasia. During the 8th week, two wounds were created in the dorsum and collected 10 days later. A control group only received wounds. Exercise was performed prior to and simultaneous with stress for 2 weeks or only prior to stress. Stress increased normetanephrine levels 10 days after wounding, resulting in an increased amount of inflammatory cells and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as angiogenesis, myofibroblast differentiation and matrix deposition. Concomitant exercise and stress potentiated these effects, intensifying the delayed wound contraction. When exercise was performed only prior to stress, however, the mice showed reduced inflammatory cells in granulation tissue 10 days after wounding and improved wound healing compared with animals with exercise and concomitant stress. Moderate exercise in association with stress potentiates the stress effect; however, when exercise was performed prior to stress, wound healing was improved.",
