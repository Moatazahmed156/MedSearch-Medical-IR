  "title": "Increased 30-day Mortality Risk in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Compared to Seasonal Influenza.",
  "abstract": "To compare 30-day all-cause mortality between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and those with seasonal influenza in South Korea. This nationwide, population-based cohort study utilized the National Health Insurance claim database, including individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 or influenza between July 2022 and December 2023. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare mortality risks, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. A total of 12,802,169 patients with COVID-19 and 2,888,777 patients with influenza were analyzed. COVID-19 was associated with significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality compared with influenza (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.60-1.94). This elevated risk remained consistent across most subgroups defined by age, sex, healthcare utilization, and comorbidities. Particularly higher risks were observed among adults aged 18-64 years (aOR, 2.93), hospitalized patients (aOR, 2.55), and those with myocardial infarction (aOR, 2.24). COVID-19 is associated with markedly higher short-term mortality than influenza across diverse clinical and demographic subgroups. These findings underscore the ongoing need for vigilant prevention efforts, and vaccination. This study represents the first large-scale nationwide analysis, and the first in Asia, conducted in the post-COVID-19 era.",
