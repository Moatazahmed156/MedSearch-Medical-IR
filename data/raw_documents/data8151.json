    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in the population with spinal cord injury (SCI) and exerts a significant impact on functional independence and quality of life in this population. A number of neuroscientists have conducted preliminary investigations of cognitive deficits after SCI, but achieved marginally contradictory results due to some limitations such as the heterogeneity in the sample population, sample size, types of tests utilized, study design, and time since SCI. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the characteristics, assessments, potential causality and treatment of cognitive impairment for better understanding such deficits in the SCI population.",
