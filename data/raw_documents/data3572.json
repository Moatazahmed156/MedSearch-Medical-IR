    "abstract": "Once obscure, Zika virus (ZIKV) has attracted significant medical and scientific attention in the past year because of large outbreaks associated with the recent introduction of this virus into the Western hemisphere. In particular, the occurrence of severe congenital infections and cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome has placed this virus squarely in the eyes of clinical and anatomic pathologists. This review article provides a basic introduction to ZIKV, its genetics, its structural characteristics, and its biology. A multidisciplinary effort will be essential to establish clinicopathologic correlations of the basic virology of ZIKV in order to advance development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.",
