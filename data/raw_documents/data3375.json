    "abstract": "This study was to compare the effect of vaccination of pigs with either type 1 or type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) against heterologous dual challenge of both genotypes. Pigs were administered type 1 (UNISTRAIN PRRS) or type 2 (Fostera PRRS) PRRSV vaccine at 28 days of age and inoculated intranasally with both genotypes at 63 days of age. Vaccination of pigs with type 1 PRRSV was able to reduce the levels of type 1 but not type 2 PRRSV viraemia, whereas vaccination of pigs with type 2 PRRSV was able to reduce the levels of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV viraemia against a dual challenge. Vaccination of pigs with type 2 PRRSV significantly reduced lung lesions after dual challenge compared with vaccination of pigs with type 1 PRRSV. Vaccination of pigs with type 2 PRRSV induced higher numbers of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV-specific interferon-γ secreting cells compared with vaccination of pigs with type 1 PRRSV after dual challenge. The results of this study demonstrated that vaccination of pigs with type 2 PRRSV is efficacious in protecting growing pigs from respiratory disease after heterologous dual type 1 and type 2 PRRSV challenge compared with vaccination of pigs with type 1 PRRSV.",
