  "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Lung Cancer: Advances in Imaging, Detection, and Prognosis.",
  "abstract": "As the primary cause of cancer-related death globally, lung cancer highlights the critical need for early identification, precise staging, and individualized treatment planning. By enabling automated diagnosis, staging, and prognostic evaluation, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have completely changed the treatment of lung cancer. The goal of this narrative review is to compile the most recent data on uses of AI and ML throughout the lung cancer care continuum. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major scientific databases to identify peer-reviewed studies focused on AI-based imaging, detection, and prognostic modeling in lung cancer. Studies were categorized into three thematic domains: (1) detection and screening, (2) staging and diagnosis, and (3) risk prediction and prognosis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have shown significant sensitivity and specificity in nodule recognition, segmentation, and false-positive reduction. Radiomics-based models and other multimodal frameworks combining imaging and clinical data have great promise for forecasting treatment outcomes and survival rates. The accuracy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging, lymph node evaluation, and malignancy classification were regularly improved by AI algorithms, frequently matching or exceeding radiologist performance. There are still issues with data heterogeneity, interpretability, repeatability, and clinical acceptability despite significant advancements. Standardized datasets, ethical AI implementation, and transparent model evaluation should be the top priorities for future initiatives. AI and ML have revolutionary potential for intelligent, personalized, and real-time lung cancer treatment by connecting computational innovation with precision oncology.",
