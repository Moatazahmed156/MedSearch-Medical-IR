    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), first discovered in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947 was understudied until the recent explosive epidemic in several South American countries where it has become strongly associated with congenital birth defects leading to severe cranial malformations and neurological conditions. The increase in number of case of microcephaly in newborn children associated with ZIKV infection triggered the World Health Organization to declare the epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February of 2016. ZIKV is a member of the flavivirus genus and is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, however in the current epidemic clear evidence is emerging to suggest the virus can be sexually transmitted from human to human. The differences in epidemiology and manifestations of ZIKV infection during these outbreaks have prompted researchers to investigate mechanisms of dissemination, pathogenesis, and host immune response which contributes significantly to the control of the virus infection. The E and NS1 proteins of ZIKV are the major targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies. In this chapter, we mainly focus on recent research on the crystal structures of the ZIKV E and NS1 proteins, and their relations with virus infection and immune responses. These studies will be helpful to develop novel therapeutics and vaccines for protection and control of ZIKV infection.",
