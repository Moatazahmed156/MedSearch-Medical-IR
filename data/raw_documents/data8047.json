    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate its incidence and risk factors in the Iranian population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, SID, and Magiran from inception until 2019. Studies that reported the incidence rate and risk factors of colorectal cancer were included in this review.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-one articles that reported the incidence rate and 13 that reported the risk factors were included. The incidence rate was different according to the population type, gender, age, and study year in different regions. The main risk factors for colorectal cancer were high consumption of red meat and fried food and low intake of fruits and vegetables, diabetes, a positive family history, and obesity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The incidence of CRC has a marked variation in different parts of Iran, and various risk factors are associated with colorectal cancer. According to incidence rate and various risk factors, precise planning is needed to control colorectal cancer in the future.",
