    "abstract": "To examine the evolutionary origin of the chordate nervous system, an outgroup comparison with hemichordates is needed. When the nervous systems of chordates and hemichordates are compared, two possibilities have been proposed, one of which is that the chordate nervous system has evolved from the nervous system of hemichordate-like larva and the other that it is comparable to the adult nervous system of hemichordates. To address this issue, we investigated the entire developmental process of the nervous system in the acorn worm Balanoglossus simodensis. In tornaria larvae, the nervous system developed along the longitudinal ciliary band and the telotroch, but no neurons were observed in the ventral band or the perianal ciliary ring throughout the developmental stages. The adult nervous system began to develop at the dorsal midline at the Krohn stage, considerably earlier than metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the larval nervous system was not incorporated into the adult nervous system. These observations strongly suggest that the hemichordate larval nervous system contributes little to the newly formed adult nervous system.",
