    "abstract": "An anatomic-pathologic-radiographic study of the proximal tibiofibular joint was undertaken. This synovial articulation between the proximal tibia and fibula may communicate with the knee joint in 10% of adults. Radiography of the normal proximal tibiofibular articulation outlines a consistent relationship between the proximal portions of the tibia and fibula. Disruption of this normal relationship is indicative of anterolateral or posteromedial subluxation or dislocation. Articular disorders of this joint include reheumatoid arthritis and septic arthritis. In the latter, initial alterations of the knee joint may subsequently extend to involve the proximal tibiofibular joint, illustrating the potential communication between these two articulations.",
