    "abstract": "Optofluidics is broadly defined as the fusion of optics and microfluidics. The term optofluidics was coined less than a decade ago. Yet, the term and the concept it encapsulates have pervaded through a significant fraction of the miniature system research community. Optofluidic research continues to grow in unanticipated directions. The Second International Conference on Optofluidics (Optofluidics-2012) showcased some of these developments. The conference was first organized by Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2011 and then Suzhou University, Institute of Nanotechnology, Xi'an Jiaotong University and Suzhou Industrial Park where it was proudly hosted as a summit conference of the CHInano conference in Suzhou on 13-15 Sep 2012. We are happy that Lab on a Chip, a major publication venue for optofluidic research has scheduled this themed issue.",
