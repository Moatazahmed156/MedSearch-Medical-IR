  "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome, a collective term for lipid and carbohydrate disorders in the organism, is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus development and its associated systemic side effects. The current approach for the medical treatment of this condition usually requires multiple medications, targeting multiple pathophysiological pathways. A promising drug class in that regard is the dual PPARα/γ agonists, which impact both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, yet to this day the vast majority of them have not passed the clinical trials, due to potential toxicity risks. In the present study we synthesized and tested a series of monoterpene-substituted ",
