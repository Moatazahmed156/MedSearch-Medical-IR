    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a common health problem affecting millions of people each year. BDNF has been investigated in the context of traumatic brain injury due to its crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Val66Met is a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism that results in a valine-to-methionine amino acid substitution at codon 66 in the BDNF prodomain, which ultimately reduces secretion of BDNF. Here, we review experimental animal models as well as clinical studies investigating the role of the Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism in traumatic brain injury outcomes, including cognitive function, motor function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and nociception. We also review studies investigating the role of BDNF on traumatic brain injury pathophysiology as well as circulating BDNF as a biomarker of traumatic brain injury.",
