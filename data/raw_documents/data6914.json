    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and economic burden. With increasing aging population, this issue is expected to continue to rise. Neurodegenerative disorders are more common with aging population in general regardless of history of TBI. Recent evidence continues to support a relation between a TBI and neurocognitive decline later in life (such as in athletes and military). This article summarizes the pathologic and clinical effects of TBI (regardless of severity) on the later development of dementia in individuals 65 years or older.",
