    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this paper is to clarify healthcare quality's ontological and epistemological foundations; and examine how these lead to different measurements and technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Design/methodology/approach:\n        \n      \n      Conceptual analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Small quality denotes conformance to ex ante requirements. Big quality includes product and service design, based on customer requirements and expectations. Healthcare quality can be divided into three areas: clinical decision making; patient safety; and patient experience, each with distinct measurement and improvement technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Practical implications:\n        \n      \n      The conceptual model is expected to bring clarity to constructing specific definitions, measures, objectives and technologies for improving healthcare.\n    \n\n\n          Originality/value:\n        \n      \n      This paper claims that before healthcare quality can be defined, measured and integrated into systems, it needs to be clearly separated into ontologically and epistemologically different parts.",
