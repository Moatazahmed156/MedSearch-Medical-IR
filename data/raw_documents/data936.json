Families with members who have been diagnosed with fragile X syndrome face concerns about the health of their newborn infant, decisions regarding family planning, and questions about the possibility that other family members could have this disorder. Neonatal nurses participate in assessment, health care management, counseling, and referral of the families regarding this syndrome.",
