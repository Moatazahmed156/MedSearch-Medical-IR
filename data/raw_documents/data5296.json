    "abstract": "Antibiotics are indicated for inappropriately prolonged durations not only for infectious diseases but also for non-infectious dermatologic conditions such as acne vulgaris, but inappropriate use is not uncommon. Inappropriate antibiotic prescription can contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, patient harm such as adverse drug events and increased healthcare costs. We experienced a case involving a late adolescent with acne vulgaris who had been treated with minocycline for more than 2 years, leading to the development of drug-induced lupus, attributed to minocycline. This resulted in multiple clinic and emergency department visits and extensive and expensive workups, including an invasive procedure. A collaboration between antibiotic stewardship activities and patient-centred medication reviews, followed by personalised deprescribing, could effectively mitigate inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for non-infectious dermatologic conditions.",
