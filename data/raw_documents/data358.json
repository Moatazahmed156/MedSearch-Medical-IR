    "abstract": "Smajdor and Rasanen (2024) argue that pregnant women are routinely denied appropriate treatment because pregnancy is seen as normal, and so they are denied 'patient status'. They claim that formally classifying pregnancy as a disease may lead to better treatment for pregnant women. In this response, we argue that pathologising pregnancy and classifying all pregnant women as 'diseased patients' won't reconfigure care in ways that benefit all women. Rather, it will likely only embolden the view that clinicians are entitled to exercise jurisdiction over pregnant women and beget the increased use of medical intervention where it is not necessarily needed.",
