  "title": "Janus Kinase Inhibitor Discontinuation at a UK Tertiary Centre: A Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor discontinuation rates and reasons for discontinuation in patients with inflammatory arthritis at a UK tertiary centre. Patients prescribed JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib) from May 2018 to October 2023 were included in this study, and those who discontinued their JAK inhibitor were identified. Statistical tests were conducted to assess for associations between discontinuation reasons and patient baseline characteristics. Of 400 patients, 102 (25.5%) discontinued their JAK inhibitors. Primary inefficacy was the most common discontinuation reason, reported in 35/102 patients (34.3%), followed by side effects in 25/102 patients (24.5%). Discontinuation rates varied among the drugs, with tofacitinib (33/64; 51.6%) and baricitinib (57/243; 23.5%) having higher overall discontinuation rates, and upadacitinib and filgotinib showing higher early discontinuation. JAK inhibitor discontinuation is primarily driven by inefficacy and side effects, with variations by drug. Further studies are needed to explore long-term safety.",
