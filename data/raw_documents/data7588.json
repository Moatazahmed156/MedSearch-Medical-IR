    "abstract": "A large number of tectonically mixed rock belts and complex tectonic zones are distributed in the southwestern part of China. In these areas, high geostress and tectonic stresses have caused some underground rock layers to be crushed and broken, eventually forming crushed rock zones. Which may undergo creep deformation under long-term loads. The manuscript is based on a typical crushed rock in the southwestern China. Firstly, the factors affecting creep deformation were analysed, and the response law of each influencing factor to rock creep is demonstrated. Then, the theory of uncorroborated measures and hierarchical analysis were used to systematically correlate the factors influencing creep. Thereby, a creep level qualitative evaluating model of crushed rock is established. Finally, this model was used to qualitatively evaluate the creep level of the crushed rock in the study area. It is concluded that the creep level qualitative evaluating of this crushed rock is rated as Class II, which is characterised by a low creep level and small creep deformations (0-10 mm). The research results can provide a reference for the creep analysis of crushed rock and provide a basis for the safe construction of engineering slopes.",
