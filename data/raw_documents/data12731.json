  "title": "Riemannian Metric Learning for Alignment of Spatial Multiomics.",
  "abstract": "Recent spatial technologies measure the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome and other modalities from thousands of cells across a tissue. Most assays typically profile only one modality from a tissue slice, raising the question of how to align spatial data from heterogeneous feature spaces. While multiple approaches have been developed for multi-modal integration of single-cell datasets, few existing techniques perform spatial alignment across arbitrary modalities incorporating both spatial and feature information. We introduce Manifold Gromov-Wasserstein ( MGW ), a metric-learning framework that exploits the product structure of spatial multiomics to infer modality-specific Riemannian  Software is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/MGW.",
