    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To assess the value of health education (active management and postural hygiene) over and above exercise alone, in patients with chronic low back pain.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Adults (aged 18-30 years) with low back pain of ≥ 3 months' duration were randomized to undergo a 12-week programme of lumbar strengthening exercise and health education or exercise alone. Pain, disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), static and dynamic muscle endurance, and health-related quality-of-life (short form-36, SF-36) were assessed at baseline and after completion of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At the end of the 12-week intervention period, pain, disability, SF-36 physical component and SF-36 mental component were significantly better in the health education group (n = 25) than in the control group (n = 24). There were no significant between-group differences in static or dynamic endurance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Health education provides additional benefits to exercise alone for improving pain, disability and mental and physical health-related quality-of-life.",
