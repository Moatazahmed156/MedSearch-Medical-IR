    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to estimate mass apparent density and Young's modulus to investigate biomechanical properties of the proximal femur bone. In this study eleven specimens of sheep femur bone having age between 1-1.25 years and human femur bone having age between 14 and 81years are used. In the present study, the first technique attempts to estimate the density from the image-based Hounsfield unit which is obtained directly from a computed tomography image. The modulus of elasticity is estimated from density-elasticity relation which is available in the literature. Another technique is used to develop a correlation between computed apparent density and greyscale based coefficient obtained by material mapping method using commercial Simpleware ScanIP software. Estimated mean deviation in apparent mass density and Young's modulus is 4.34% and 4.69% in sheep bone and 4.35% and 4.94% in human bone respectively. It is found that apparent density and Young's modulus obtained shows close agreement with values reported in the literature. Moreover, the study attempts to build up a new material model between human and sheep for orthopaedics clinical trials and research in Indian context. In addition, it is also observed that bone mass density of sheep is 1.60 times human. This method can also be useful to study and analyse biomechanical properties of the human femur bone.",
