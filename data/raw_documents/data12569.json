  "abstract": "To objectively evaluate quantitative image parameters-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-of peritoneal metastases (PMs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) on virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) reconstructed from dual-layer spectral CT (DLCT) technology. This prospective single-center study included consecutive patients scheduled for cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) between September 1, 2023, and May 1, 2025. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced DLCT < 7 days before surgery. SNR, CNR between PMs and mesenteric fat (CNR  A total of 92 PMs (24 mPMs, 68 nmPMs) in 55 patients were analyzed. For both mPMs and nmPMs, attenuation, SNR, CNR  Low-energy VMIs obtained from spectral CT significantly improve SNR and CNR of PMs, particularly for nmPMs, supporting their integration into preoperative reading protocols.",
