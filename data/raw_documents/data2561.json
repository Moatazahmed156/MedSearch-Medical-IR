    "abstract": "The association of different autoimmune diseases in the same subject is not uncommon, also in the pediatric age. The coexistence of morphea and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is however exceptional. We report four such cases. Unlike the few other reported cases, in 3/4 of our patients, morphea appeared well after the onset of JIA, when the articular disease was in full clinical remission. Based on the epidemiology of pediatric morphea in the general population, this association is unlikely to be fortuitous. Pediatric rheumatologists should be aware of this possible association, and follow clinically patients who achieve long-term clinical remission. Key Points ⦁ Morphea is an unusual occurrence in the context of JIA. These conditions have a common autoimmune background, but are very rarely reported together. ⦁ It is important to follow JIA patients even during long-term remission since other autoimmune phenomena can occur.",
