    "abstract": "Due to the rarity of hemolymphangioma, a limited number of cases of the disease have been reported in the literature thus far. The present case report describes the cases of 4 patients with hemolymphangioma that were diagnosed and treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an, China). All patients were female, with a mean age of 44.7 years and a mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis of 2.7 years. The diagnosis of hemolymphangioma was determined by postoperative histopathology in all patients. A total of 2 patients were diagnosed with tumors that exhibited cystic characteristics (one in the mediastinum and the other in the neck), which was determined by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Another of the patients' tumors was located in the left forearm, and 1 patient had multifocal hemolymphangioma in the mediastinum and spleen. All patients underwent surgery and were asymptomatic during the follow-up periods (range, 8-15 months). In the present case report, the radiographic findings of the 4 cases are presented, including the unusual imaging characteristics that were observed, and relevant reports in the literature are discussed.",
