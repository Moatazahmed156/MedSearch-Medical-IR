  "abstract": "Through a focused screening of FDA-approved drugs using a spike RBD-ACE2 interaction assay, we identified bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), as an unexpected yet potent entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Bazedoxifene disrupted spike-mediated attachment and demonstrated robust inhibition in both pseudovirus (IC",
