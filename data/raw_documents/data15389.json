  "title": "The critical link between TB infection control process and clinical impact: need for efficacy data and MDR-TB specificity.",
  "abstract": "The study by Song et al. [1] detailing the significant improvements in Tuberculosis Infection Control (TBIC) implementation rates across designated hospitals in Jiangsu Province, China, provides valuable data on the feasibility of programmatic interventions in high-burden settings. The demonstrated rise in compliance for Administrative Controls (AC), Environmental Controls (EC), and Respiratory Protection (RP) is commendable. However, as scholars focused on global TB elimination, we must constructively appraise whether measuring implementation rates adequately captures the desired public health impact, particularly in facilities designated for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).",
