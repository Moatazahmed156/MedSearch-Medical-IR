    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer, which ranks eighth among global female cancers and fifth in fatality, poses a significant health challenge owing to its asymptomatic early stages. Understanding the pathogenesis requires extensive research. Recent studies have emphasized the role of the gut and cervicovaginal microbiota in ovarian cancer. This review explores the current understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and ovarian cancer, considering the potential of biomarkers in the serum and various tissues. Insights into the influence of the microbiome on treatments, including surgery and chemotherapy, open doors to innovative approaches, such as fecal microbiome transplantation. This synthesis of recent findings provides crucial insights into the intricate interplay between the microbiome and ovarian cancer, thereby shaping diagnostic and treatment strategies.",
