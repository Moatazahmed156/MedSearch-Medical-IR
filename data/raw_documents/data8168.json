    "abstract": "The effects of spinal cord injury can be devastating. An understanding of spinal anatomy and the mechanisms of injury provide the basis for correlating presenting signs and symptoms with the extent of neural damage. Understanding the principles of acute care management will help guide the nurse in executing interventions aimed at preservation of neurologic functions. Research must continue to focus on quality-of-life issues and methods of preventing both primary and secondary injuries.",
