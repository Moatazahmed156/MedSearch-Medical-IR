  "title": "Uromodulin alleviates fibrosis in acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition by reducing EGFR.",
  "abstract": "Uromodulin has been speculated as a protective factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), possibly based on the uromodulin-mediated cross-talk between thick ascending limbs and proximal tubules. Here, we explored the roles of uromodulin in the AKI-CKD transition. Wild-type SD rats and UMOD UMOD Collectively, we discovered uromodulin may alleviate the progression of AKI-CKD transition via the EGFR suppression.",
