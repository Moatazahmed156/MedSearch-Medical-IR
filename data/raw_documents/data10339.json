  "abstract": "ObjectiveTo qualitatively explore the perceptions and experiences of patients with coronary artery disease regarding discontinuation of home-based exercise rehabilitation.DesignA qualitative, descriptive design was utilized in this study.SettingThis study focused on home-based exercise rehabilitation.ParticipantsA purposive sample of 24 patients who had voluntarily participated in the home-based exercise rehabilitation program was recruited.Main measuresSemistructured interviews were undertaken. Data were analyzed using a framework approach.ResultsA total of 24 participants (13 males and 11 females) from 28 to 77 years were recruited for this study to examine the endogenous and exogenous factors that influence withdrawal from exercise rehabilitation. The four major themes identified were (1) \"exercise inertia,\" (2) \"perception deviation,\" (3) \"disruption of habit loop,\" and (4) \"weakness in exercise literacy.\" These themes were further divided into 12 subthemes.ConclusionsSustained implementation of home-based exercise rehabilitation is crucial for patients with coronary heart disease. Discontinuation of exercise regimens frequently stems from patients' internal perceptions, including exercise inertia, cognitive biases, disruptions in established habit loops, and insufficient exercise literacy. Consequently, enhancing patient awareness of exercise rehabilitation and strengthening supervision of exercise routines are imperative. Establishing a multidisciplinary home-based exercise management system would further facilitate the optimization of exercise-related benefits.",
