    "abstract": "The complexity of the healthy haematopoietic system is immense, and as such, one must understand the biology driving normal haematopoietic expression profiles when designing experiments and interpreting expression data that involve normal cells. This article seeks to present an organised approach to the use and interpretation of gene profiling in normal haematopoiesis and broadly illustrates the challenges of selecting appropriate controls for high-throughput expression studies.",
