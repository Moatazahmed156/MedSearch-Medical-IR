    "abstract": "Recent gene therapy clinical trials have demonstrated significant promise for treating a number of genetic neuromuscular disorders. Although nurses are experienced in educating patients and families about the benefits and risks of conventional therapeutics, there are significant challenges for guiding patients through the decision-making phase of gene therapy clinical trial participation. The first part of this review provides an overview and update on neuromuscular gene therapy, including viral delivery principles and historical progress. The second part discusses risk/benefit perception of gene therapy and factors affecting the decision making for patients interested in participating in a trial. Future challenges for gene therapy are targeted high-efficiency delivery, and additional research on developing patient-centered decision support interventions.",
