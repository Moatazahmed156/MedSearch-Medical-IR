  "title": "Exploring mutual aid-based community engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study of community group buying in China.",
  "abstract": "Community mutual aid is a form of community engagement involving multiple stakeholders working together to provide both material and emotional support. During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, community group buying (CGB) exhibited distinct features of community mutual aid, reflected in its flexible product supply and spontaneous neighborhood support. However, the mechanisms driving the emergence of such mutual aid practices remain insufficiently explored. This study employed a qualitative research design combining ethnographic observation and interpretive case analysis to examine whether, why, and how CGB in China transformed into community mutual aid practices during the lockdown, as well as the outcomes of this transformation. Data were collected primarily through semi-structured interviews ( The analysis identified six interrelated dimensions shaping the transformation of CGB into community mutual aid: disaster risk, community networks, participation pathways, psychological motivations, community resilience, and social inequality. Disaster risk acted as an external catalyst that activated social capital, while pre-existing community networks served as internal driving forces-together forming the prerequisites for this transformation. Participation pathways and psychological motivations further facilitated the reproduction of structural and relational social capital, constituting the core process of transformation. This transformation strengthened community resilience by reinforcing trust, reciprocity, and collective efficacy, but also revealed the \"dark side\" of social capital, as digital divides and unequal access to resources deepened social inequality. Our findings offer new insights into CGB-based mutual aid in context of China's crisis. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of mutual aid-based community engagement, but also offers practical insights for mobilizing social capital in future public health emergencies. Further research should investigate the applicability of the CGB model across diverse sociocultural contexts and assess its long-term impact.",
