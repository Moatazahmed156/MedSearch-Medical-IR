    "abstract": "Lifestyle changes including reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity (PA) improve the prognosis associated with bariatric surgery (BS) and metabolic indices. Early implementation of exercise leads to improved physical performance, better glycemic control and lipid profile, reduces the risks associated with anesthesia, and accelerates recovery from surgery. Undertaking systematic exercise after BS is associated with a better quality of life, improves insulin sensitivity, results in additional weight loss, reduces adverse effects on bone mass, and results in better body composition. The aim of this review was to summarize recommendations for physical activity in patients undergoing BS and to highlight the key role of physical activity in this patient group.",
