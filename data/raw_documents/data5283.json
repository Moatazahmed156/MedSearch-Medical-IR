    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The cause of systemic lupus erythematosus is not completely clear so far, but the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is significantly increased in people with additional X chromosomes.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      We report a 17-year-old Chinese female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with trisomy X, accompanied by lupus nephritis, pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiserous effusion. The patient recovered well after treatment and returned regularly. We review the previously reported cases to summarize the clinical characteristics of these patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The additional X chromosome is related to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. Whether it is a subtype of systemic lupus erythematosus remains to be further confirmed.",
