    "abstract": "This scoping review aims to synthesize the current landscape of physical activity in cancer prehabilitation and identify knowledge gaps. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and WEB OF SCIENCE for exercise interventions and observational studies that measured exercise or physical activity before cancer treatment from inception to January 20, 2023. Fifty-one articles from 44 unique studies were reviewed, including 32 intervention and 12 observational studies. Surgery is the only treatment modality that has been investigated. Included studies used heterogeneous exercise interventions and measures for physical activity. Colorectal and other gastrointestinal, lung, and urologic cancers are the most studied cancer types. Exercise intervention in cancer prehabilitation is highly feasible. The evidence for improved fitness, functional, psychosocial, and clinical outcomes is promising yet limited. Although research has increased recently, prehabilitation exercise remains a relatively under-investigated area in oncology. We have provided research directions towards an ideal cancer prehabilitation design in the real-world setting.",
