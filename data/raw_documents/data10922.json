  "title": "Using a photovoice methodology to explore the impacts of living with COPD on quality of life.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition with a debilitating symptom profile that significantly impacts quality of life (QoL). While its physiological burden is well-documented, innovative qualitative approaches can offer valuable insights into the lived experience, and its broader impact on wellbeing. Eight participants contributed 67 photographs using a photovoice methodology. Participants were invited via social media platforms and patient support networks (Breathe Easy Networks). Each participant provided up to ten photographs illustrating the impact of COPD and completed a follow-up interview for contextual understanding. Thematic analysis of interviews and images identified three key themes: (1) self-criticism, shame and emotional responses to COPD, (2) interactions and relationships with others and (3) strategies and methods to help with well-being and managing the impact of COPD. Breathlessness emerged as a pervasive experience underpinning emotional responses, shaping perceptions of loss, change and experience of others. COPD's impact extends beyond physical symptoms, encompassing psychological and social dimensions. Photovoice offered a novel lens to explore these complexities highlighting the importance of addressing self-criticism, shame, emotional responses and interactions with others in patient care. Interventions should consider both individual coping strategies and systemic factors influencing daily life.",
