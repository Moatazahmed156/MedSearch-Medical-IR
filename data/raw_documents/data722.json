    "abstract": "Mental health is a burden on society globally, particularly for young people, leading to unprecedented demands for mental health services. Organized sport programs provide a unique opportunity to reach young people \"where they are\" with mental health and well-being programs. This article reviews the relevant literature on interventions that target the promotion of mental health and well-being among youth in organized sports programs, research that incorporates strengths-based approaches in sports, and studies that are more comprehensive, which include screening and intervention that target physical well-being, personal attributes and character strengths, and mental health symptom management within youth sports programs.",
