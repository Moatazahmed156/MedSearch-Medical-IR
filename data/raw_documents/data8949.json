    "abstract": "The choice of treatment in spontaneous intracerebral haematomas has always been controversial. As indications to surgery should be regarded: location and size of haematoma, shifting of midline structures and deterioration of consciousness. The results of treatment are worsened by deep location of haematoma, especially in thalamus and brain stem region, very big size, primary serious condition, very advanced age of the patient and some metabolic diseases like liver dysfunction. It is difficult to establish fixed rules of treatment of spontaneous intracerebral haematomas and the decision depends mainly on the experience of the surgeon.",
