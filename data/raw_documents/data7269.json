    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the prevalence of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among women in Shaan'xi Province of China, and to detect the characteristics of genital HPV infection among these women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Totally 8581 women in the Department of Gynaecology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University were enrolled to detect HPV-DNA in their genital tracts by PCR+flow-through hybridization. Some subjects were also screened by cytology or histology.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among these subjects, the prevalence of female genital tract HPV infection was 33.06%, among which high risk (HR)-HPV infection accounted for 30.08% and multiple HR-HPV infection 27.18%. The genotypes HPV-16, -52,-58, -6, and HPV-18 were the most prevalent strains. The distribution of HPV infection differed among different age groups:the first infection peak occured less than 25 years and the second peak was above 51 years. Among the HR-HPV DNA positive women, the rates of HR-HPV infection with normal histology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasias 1 (CIN1), CIN2 ,CIN3, and cervical cancer (CC) were 88.72%, 97.48%, 97.35%, 95.88%, and 99.23%, respectively. For women with CC, HPV-16 was the most common genotype, followed by HPV-18, HPV-58, HPV-52, and HPV-33. HPV-16 ,-18, and 58 were responsible for 94.62% of CC cases in this region.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The most common genotypes of HPV infection among women in Shaan'xi province are HPV-16, HPV-52, HPV-58, HPV-6, and HPV-18. HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-58, HPV-52, and HPV-33 are the most frequently genotypes found in cervical carcinoma, in particular HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-58. HR-HPV infection aggravates the cervical lesions. The multiple HPV infections increase the risk of cervical lesions.",
