The diagnosis was determined by biopsy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After local irradiation of 46 Gy, the tumor disappeared completely.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Irradiation therapy effectively treated this tumor, as shown radiologically, although the patient remained paraplegic.",
