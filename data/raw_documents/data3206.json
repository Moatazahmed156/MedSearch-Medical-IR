    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with obesity and obesity-related comorbidities, with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy being the two most common procedures. Despite the success of these interventions, adverse events are not uncommon. Endoscopic management has become first-line therapy when complications occur, and the armamentarium of devices and techniques continues to grow. This article focuses on the management of fistulas, leaks, and ulcers and also focuses on the etiology and endoscopic management strategy of each complication.",
