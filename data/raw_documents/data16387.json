  "title": "Co-infection in pediatric pertussis during 2023 and 2024 in southern China: pathogen distribution characteristic and influence on manifestation of pertussis.",
  "abstract": "We sought to examine the pathogen composition of co-infections in pertussis during 2023 and 2024 and assess the impacts of co-infection on pertussis. Clinical data of pediatric pertussis patients were retrospectively analyzed. The impact of co-infections on pertussis, the detection rate and composition of co-pathogens were analyzed. Culture, polymerase chain reaction, or metagenomic sequencing were used in pertussis or co-pathogens detection. Among 620 pertussis patients, 110 patients co-infected with bacteria, 106 co-infected with virus, and 98 co-infected with both bacteria and virus.  Co-infections are common among pertussis and can intensify clinical symptoms. Distribution of co-infecting pathogens is associated with age and hospitalization status, and the impacts of co-infection on the manifestations of pertussis varied according to the types and number of co-pathogens.",
