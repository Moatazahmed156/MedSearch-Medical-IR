  "abstract": "The growing prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) underscores the need for early, cost-effective diagnostics to prevent its progression to cirrhosis or liver cancer. This study evaluates the accuracy of non-invasive markers in predicting MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) through a meta-analysis and cross-sectional validation. A comprehensive literature search (2010-2024) via PubMed and Google Scholar identified studies assessing non-invasive diagnostic tools-hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty liver index (FLI), NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), AST/platelet ratio index (APRI), AST/ALT ratio, and BARD score. Meta-analysis of 83 studies was performed using the MADA package in R 4.3.3. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, while Deeks' test performed for publication bias. ROC curve analysis, using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2, validated the diagnostic performance of non-invasive markers in a cross-sectional study. Meta-analysis revealed that FLI showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 for diagnosing MASLD. FIB-4 achieved an AUC of 0.82 for identifying stage ≥3 fibrosis, while NFS showed an AUC of 0.80 for stage ≥2 fibrosis. Cross-sectional validation showed comparable results, with FLI achieving an AUC of 0.92 for MASLD and NFS showing an AUC of 0.88 for MASH. This meta-analysis and cross-sectional validation confirm that non-invasive biomarkers, such as FLI, FIB-4, and NFS, demonstrate significant diagnostic accuracy for MASLD and MASH. The findings highlight the value of these tools for widespread, cost-effective screening in at-risk populations.",
