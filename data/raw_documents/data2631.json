    "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequently associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). Urodynamic investigation (UDI) is the gold standard for assessing LUTD, but its value in identifying UTI risk factors remains underexplored. Studies have shown high rates of storage and voiding dysfunction in patients with recurrent UTIs, suggesting a causal link between LUTD and UTIs. Specific UDI findings, such as low bladder capacity, high detrusor pressures, and detrusor overactivity, have been associated with greater UTI risk, especially in kidney transplant recipients and infants. However, the current evidence is limited by the lack of control groups and therapeutic interventions, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine if UDI-guided therapies can improve UTI management outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: Urinary infections are often linked to problems with the lower urinary tract. Tests that measure lower urinary tract function can help in identifying these issues. More research is needed to see if treating bladder problems can prevent urinary infections.",
