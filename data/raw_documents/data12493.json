  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer death, with the tumor microenvironment and gene expression influencing outcomes. Identifying survival-associated epithelial marker genes (EMGs) may improve prognosis and guide therapy. We obtained single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from CRC patients (",
