  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes bone destruction by activating inflammatory cytokines and osteoclasts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21), a cell cycle regulator, may influence this process; however, its role remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect and potential mechanisms of p21 deficiency in bone loss in a mouse model of arthritis. Collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) was established in p21 knockout (",
