  "abstract": "Dormancy is a vital survival strategy employed by cells to endure stressful environments. It is characterized by a significant reduction in metabolic and proliferative activity and can be triggered by various conditions, including low humidity, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and pressure from the host immune response. Here, we highlight how tumor cells remain dormant in tissue and how fungi employ this strategy to survive and spread throughout the environment. However, we primarily discuss the dormancy mechanisms of ",
