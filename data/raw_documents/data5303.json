    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Low vitamin D levels are commonly observed in autoimmune diseases, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. The presence of anti-vitamin D antibodies may contribute to these deficiencies and influence autoimmune processes.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To review and analyze studies investigating the occurrence of anti-vitamin D antibodies in autoimmune diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three studies, comprising a total of 345 patients, were reviewed. The autoimmune conditions included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (SSc), primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (pAPS), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Patient mean ages ranged from 26.8 to 31 years, with the proportion of female participants ranging from 87 % to 96 %. The duration of disease varied between 6.3 and 12.3 years. Serum vitamin D levels ranged from 11.71 ± 7.21 to 28.4 ± 9.6 ng/mL, with 57.1 % to 82.1 % of patients presenting vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of anti-vitamin D antibodies was reported as follows: 87 % in SSc, 11 % in PV, 4 % to 6.1 % in SLE, and 3.5 % in pAPS. Associations with other disease markers were also noted: in SLE, anti-vitamin D antibodies were associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies; while in SSc, their presence was linked to the disease itself.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Anti-vitamin D antibodies were identified in 3.5 % to 87 % of patients with SLE, SSc, pAPS, and PV. These antibodies are associated either with the autoimmune condition itself or with other autoantibodies, suggesting their potential role in disease mechanisms and progression.",
