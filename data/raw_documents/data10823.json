  "abstract": "Undetectable IgE levels are a frequent feature of common variable immune deficiency (CVID). However, not much is known regarding the role of IgE levels as a prognostic factor in CVID patients. We hypothesized that undetectable IgE levels would be associated with higher risk of non-infectious complications of CVID. We compared clinical and laboratory outcomes in 60 CVID patients with detectable IgE and 89 CVID patients with undetectable IgE. Undetectable IgE was associated with significantly lower IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations. In addition, these patients had significantly lower numbers of CD4+ T cells, total B cells, plasmablasts, as well as reduced memory and especially switch memory B cells, but no difference in CD21low B cells. Undetectable IgE was associated with a significantly higher frequency of autoimmune cytopenias and lymphoma and trends towards higher relative frequencies of serious bacterial infections and granulomatous disease. Undetectable IgE is a readily available biomarker that in a patient with CVID may direct clinicians to be particularly vigilant for non-infectious complications of CVID.",
