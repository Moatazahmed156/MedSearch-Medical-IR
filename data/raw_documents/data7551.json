    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is one of the most common unmet needs for cancer patients and caregivers. Yet little is known about the potentially unique nature of caregiver FCR. Our research aimed to address this gap by qualitatively exploring the features and impact of caregiver FCR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighteen semi-structured telephone interviews with cancer caregivers were conducted to explore the content and impact of caregiver fears and worries about cancer recurrence or progression. Data analysis used a Framework Approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Qualitative analysis identified three themes (1) fear of the patient suffering, (2) the need to protect the patient from a recurrence and/or cancer-related distress, and (3) caregiver's sense of unpreparedness and uncertainty. Underpinning these themes was an overarching sense of personal responsibility for the life of the patient. This overarching theme was identified as a key driver of caregivers' personal and patient-centred fears.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings confirm the conceptual differences between patient and caregiver FCR. Future research must therefore acknowledge the unique experiences of caregivers and prioritise the development of empirically driven theoretical models, instruments, and interventions for caregiver FCR.",
