    "abstract": "With increases in survivorship for patients with head and neck cancer, attention is turning to quality-of-life issues for survivors. Care for these patients is multifaceted. Dysphagia and issues of voice/speech, airway obstruction, neck and shoulder dysfunction, lymphedema, and pain control are important to address. Rehabilitation interventions are patient-specific and aim to prevent, restore, compensate, and palliate symptoms and sequelae of treatment for optimal functioning. Central to providing comprehensive interdisciplinary care are the head and neck surgeon, laryngologist, and speech-language pathologist. Routine functional assessment, long-term follow-up, and regular communication and coordination among these specialists helps maximize quality of life in this challenging patient population.",
