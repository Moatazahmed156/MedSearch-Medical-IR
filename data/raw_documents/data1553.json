    "abstract": "The current trends of prevalence, incidence, and mortality in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are summarized. We describe the differences in the definitions of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction used in community-based studies, heart failure registries, and clinical trials. The worldwide prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is approximately 2%; it is becoming the dominant form of heart failure owing to the aging population. The longitudinal trend of mortality in this disease is decreasing, and the risk of mortality is similar between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",
