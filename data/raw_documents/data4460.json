    "abstract": "Developmental breast asymmetry (DBA) can affect psychosocial well-being in the young female. Correction of breast asymmetry may present a reconstructive challenge, especially in tuberous breasts. Fifty-two cases of DBA treated between January 2002 and January 2006 were reviewed. Preoperative clinical assessment of the specific anatomical deformity, subsequent surgical treatment modalities, esthetic outcome, and patient's satisfaction were evaluated. Surgical modalities used in our series include augmentation mammaplasty with or without tissue expansion, parenchymal scoring, nipple areola complex reduction, glanduloplasty techniques, mastopexy and reduction mammaplasty. The mean age of DBA presentation was 21 years; 69% (36/52) patients had tuberous breasts, of which 67% (24/36) were unilateral and 33% (12/36) were bilateral deformities. Patients with tuberous breast deformity presented consistently under the age of 25 years. Esthetic outcome was rated \"good\" in 75% (39/52), and symmetry rated as \"good\" in 58% (30/52) by professional evaluation. Surgical treatment is tailored to the affected esthetic units of the individual breast. In our experience, symmetry is the hardest parameter to achieve, particularly in tuberous breasts. Operative treatment is of great value to the psychosocial well-being of the patient. A conceptual approach in the assessment and treatment of DBA is emphasized by this series.",
