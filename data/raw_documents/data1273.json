    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common form of arrhythmia and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. While there are many potential causes of atrial fibrillation that have been well studied, this work considers the potential effect of chronically skipping meals on the development of atrial fibrillation. The authors discuss the various processes that skipping meals initiates in the body that may ultimately result in atrial fibrillation. Through a better understanding of the various disease pathophysiologies that can contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation, this narrative review may help lead to more advanced therapeutic and preventive approaches.",
