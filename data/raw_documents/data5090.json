    "abstract": "The functional state of T cells is diverse and under dynamic control for adapting to the changes of microenvironment. Reversible protein phosphorylation represents an important post-translational modification that not only involves in the immediate early response of T cells, but also affects their functionality in the long run. Perturbation of global phosphorylation profile and/or phosphorylation of specific signaling nodes result in aberrant T cell activity. Dual specific phosphatases (DUSPs), which target MAPKs and beyond, have increasingly been emerged as a versatile regulator in T cell biology. Herein in this mini review, we sought to summarize and discuss the impact of DUSP proteins on the regulation of effector T cell activity, T cell polarization, regulatory T cell development and T cell senescence/exhaustion. Given the distinctive engagement of each DUSP member under various disease settings such as chronic infection, autoimmune disorders, cancer and age-related diseases, DUSP proteins likely hold the promise to become a druggable target other than the existing therapeutics that are predominantly by manipulating protein kinase activity.",
