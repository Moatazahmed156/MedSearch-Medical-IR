    "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein that regulates cholesterol levels by lysosomal low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation and has recently been associated with the production of neuronal oxidative stress and age-associated cardiovascular dysfunction. Since increased oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction are implicated in the pathology of aging and various neurodegenerative disorders, targeting PCSK9 may offer a promising therapeutic avenue for addressing these conditions. While the precise mechanisms through which PCSK9 contributes to vascular and neuronal oxidative stress in the brain remain elusive, preclinical studies have highlighted a neuroprotective effect linked to PCSK9 inhibition. This inhibition has shown promise in reducing oxidative stress, mitigating neuroinflammation, and alleviating neuropathological changes, thus underscoring the therapeutic potential of this approach in addressing neurodegenerative conditions.",
