  "abstract": "Ceftazidime-avibactam (CA) and CA plus aztreonam (ATM) are the preferred treatment options for KPC and MBL carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales infections (CPEis). All episodes of monomicrobial CPEis in immunosuppressed patients (IPs) admitted from May 2019 to November 2024, who received definitive antibiotic therapy (AT) with CA or CA + ATM for at least 72 h, were prospectively included. Bacteremic episodes (BEs) and non-bacteremic episodes (NBEs) were compared. Logistic regressions adjusted by propensity score were used to identify variables associated with 30-day overall mortality. In total, 82 CPEis were included (38 NBEs and 44 BEs). BEs more frequently occurred in hematological malignancies (52.3% vs. 15.8%, ",
