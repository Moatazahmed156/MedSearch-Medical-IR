  "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic condition characterized by airway inflammation. Dietary habits have been associated with allergic respiratory disorders, but the specific dietary preferences linked to childhood asthma remain unclear. To investigate the relationship between dietary preferences and childhood asthma in Minhang District, Shanghai, China. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 sub-districts/towns of Minhang District, Shanghai, in 2014. First-grade primary school students were surveyed during their annual physical examinations. Data on dietary preferences and health status were collected through questionnaires completed by the children's primary caregivers. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between dietary preferences and asthma. Stratified analyses were conducted by sex and body mass index groups. A total of 8412 children, with an average age of 6.64 ± 0.29 years, participated in the survey. After adjusting for potential confounders, children who reported a preference for pickled and smoked foods exhibited a significantly elevated risk of asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-2.82). Subgroup analysis further revealed that girls with a preference for fried foods were at a higher risk of developing asthma (OR = 14.72; 95% CI: 1.89-114.65). Our findings suggest that certain dietary preferences, particularly for pickled and smoked foods, may be significant risk factors for childhood asthma.",
