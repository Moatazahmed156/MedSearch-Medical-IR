    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to assess the drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to spectinomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Moreover, the temporal trends in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five antibiotics from Zhejiang, China, are also in the scope of this study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1710 gonococcal clinical strains were collected between 2007 and 2021 from health-care institutions in Zhejiang. The MICs of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, spectinomycin, penicillin and ciprofloxacin were assessed by agar dilution method on 1710 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates. Count data were expressed as strains and rates, and MICs distribution was elucidated using descriptive statistics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The total resistance rates of gonococci to azithromycin, spectinomycin, penicillin and ciprofloxacin in this study were 19.3%, 0.3%, 75.4% and 99.7%, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The in vitro results showed a high prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin. Azithromycin resistance rate has exceeded 5%, suggested a high prevalence of resistance. Ceftriaxone and spectinomycin are suggested based on this study for the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Zhejiang.",
