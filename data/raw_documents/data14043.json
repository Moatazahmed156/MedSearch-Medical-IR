  "title": "Ectopic engraftment of nociceptive neurons derived from hPSCs for pain relief and joint homeostasis.",
  "abstract": "Chronic pain arises from the interplay of inflammatory signals that activate and sensitize nociceptors within injured tissues. Most analgesics fail clinically due to their mono-targeted mechanisms. Here, we apply human pluripotent stem cell-derived nociceptive neurons (hPSC-NNs) as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis, targeting both pain and joint degeneration. We generated sensory neurons from hPSCs and identified  hPSC-derived nociceptors (hPSC-NNs) as Decoy Engraftment for Cellular Interception and Repair (DECIR) when transplanted into the knee joint, extending beyond conventional regenerative strategies ",
