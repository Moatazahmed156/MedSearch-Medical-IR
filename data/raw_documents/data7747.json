    "abstract": "Adolescent young adult (AYA) cancer survivors continue to have substantive unmet needs. Literature and insights from a task force of survivors, caregivers, and survivor advocates convened by Servier Pharmaceuticals indicate desires for peer created and provided support. This secondary data analysis of information from the task force identified unmet needs in five domains and solutions explored for four prioritized needs. Ultimately, four actionable solution concepts were selected by the task force for further development. Through their work, many key insights about including survivors in creating solutions and the many approaches for best serving AYAs with cancer were revealed.",
