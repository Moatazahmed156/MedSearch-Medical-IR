  "title": "Long-Term Transcriptomic Reprogramming in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Severe COVID-19 Survivors Reveals Pro-Oncogenic Signatures and Cancer-Associated Hub Genes.",
  "abstract": "This study examined the long-term transcriptomic reprogramming in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of severe COVID-19 patients and its effects for cancer development. RNA sequencing was conducted on PBMCs obtained from healthy controls, COVID-19 patients without pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients exhibiting severe pneumonia one year post-infection. Differential gene expression analysis identified a sustained pro-oncogenic molecular signature, especially among severe COVID-19 patients. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a substantial enrichment of cancer-associated pathways, encompassing apoptosis, viral carcinogenesis, and transcriptional dysregulation. Notably, the autophagy-related gene SQSTM1/P62 was recognized as a distinctive hub gene within the severe COVID-19 patients, interacting with pivotal genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and cancer advancement. Survival analysis demonstrated that elevated expression of COVID-19-associated hub genes correlated with unfavorable prognosis in various cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and brain lower-grade glioma. These findings indicate that severe COVID-19 infection may establish a systemic milieu favorable to cancer development or recurrence, highlighting the necessity of prolonged oncological monitoring in these patients. Finding specific molecular targets and pathways can help us understand how COVID-19 might be linked to a higher risk of cancer.",
