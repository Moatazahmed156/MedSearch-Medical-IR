    "abstract": "Three sets of paired circular and square full-thickness skin wounds were made on the dorsum of the metacarpus (n = 48) of 8 horses. Each wound was 6.25 cm2 in area. The wounds were treated topically with an ointment, nonadherent dressing, and bandaged with a snug elastic wrap. Wounds were photographed every other day until healing was complete. Wound areas were measured and exponential and linear wound healing models were applied to the wound healing data generated. Wound healing variables measured for each wound were: number of days to healing, maximal size attained, rate of wound contraction (calculated by use of first-order and linear models), final wound size, and percentage of wound that healed by contraction. The exponential model fit the data significantly better than the linear model. The maximal size attained by circular wounds was significantly smaller than the maximal size attained by square wounds. Wound shape did not influence the rate of wound healing. On the basis of our findings, conversion of circular defects to square defects would not speed wound healing.",
