    "abstract": "The intention of this study was to elucidate what the concept \"quality of life\" means to elderly women. A qualitative approach based on 282 women (age 75-93 years) showed that the participants were able to articulate what quality of life meant to them. Thinking about what makes for a good quality of life, 82.3% mentioned the importance of good social functioning, 68.8% mentioned good health, 22.3% mentioned good economic circumstances, and 14.9% mentioned the importance of living in their own flat or house. Six categories were identified based on the women's descriptions: holism, relationships, activity and participation, pragmatic approach to health, belonging and social environment, and personal values. The lay perspective on quality of life is characterized by three qualities: preservation of continuity-sameness within change, power-empowerment, and the quest for meaning.",
