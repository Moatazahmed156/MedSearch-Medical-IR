  "title": "Development of a novel-ionizable-lipid-based mRNA vaccine for broad protection against ",
  "abstract": "Recently, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine technology has made significant advances in preventing pathogenic microbial infections. The composition and physicochemical properties of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) determine the delivery efficiency of mRNA vaccines. In this study, we synthesized a novel ionizable lipid, C14-192, featuring a 3-oxo-polyamine head group, which was used as a component for LNP to encapsulate and deliver mRNA. Analysis of ",
