    "abstract": "Yellow fever vaccine is a live, attenuated viral preparation from the 17D virus strain. Since 1996, 34 cases of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) have been described. We report a new case of YEL-AVD. Given the potential risks associated with the vaccine, physicians should consider vaccination only for patients truly at risk for exposure to yellow fever, especially for primovaccination.",
