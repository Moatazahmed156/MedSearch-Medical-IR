    "abstract": "Background : There is few reports evaluated accurately the pain generator of low back pain in elite athletes. The purpose of this report was to show case series and to investigate the cause of unidentified low back pain of elite athletes. Methods : Twenty-three adult elite athletes consulted our sports spine clinic to seek a second opinion for low back pain between April 2013 and March 2016. Their cause of low back pain had not been identified by nearby doctor. Spine surgeons had diagnosed using diagnostic injection and STIR-MRI and the final diagnosis made by the spine surgeon were collected. Results : The mean age of 23 patients (16 male, 7 female) was 30.4 years. The most common sport played was baseball. The final diagnosis made by a spine surgeon was as follows : disc related low back pain (n = 12), facet joint arthritis (n = 5), vertebral endplate injury (n = 4), early-stage lumbar spondylolysis (n = 1), supraspinous ligament injury (n = 1). Conclusions : A thorough medical interview, careful physical examination, appropriate diagnostic imaging, and injection block examination can effectively identify the cause of low back pain. J. Med.
