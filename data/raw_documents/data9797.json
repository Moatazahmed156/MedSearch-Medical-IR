  "title": "Exploring the Link Between Sleep Duration and Visual Impairment and Major Eye Diseases: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2008.",
  "abstract": "This study is aimed at investigating the association between sleep duration and visual impairment, as well as its relationship with major eye diseases, using data from a large-scale population-based survey. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of visual impairment and major eye conditions among 5231 individuals aged 40 and older, utilizing data from the NHANES 2005-2008 survey. Sleep duration was categorized as short (< 7 h), normal (7-9 h), and long (> 9 h). Visual impairment was defined as corrected visual acuity < 20/40, and major eye diseases included cataract surgery, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, any retinopathy, any ocular disease, and any objectively determined ocular disease. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations between sleep duration, visual impairment, and major eye diseases. Stratified analyses were further conducted based on diabetes and hypertension status. The long sleep group demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of vision impairment, cataract surgery, glaucoma, as well as any ocular disease and any objectively determined ocular disease compared to the normal and short sleep groups (all  Long sleep duration is independently associated with visual impairment, glaucoma, and any objectively determined ocular disease. Longitudinal studies are needed to validate current results and explore causal mechanisms.",
