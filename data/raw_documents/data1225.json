    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, a chronic disease, is characterized by high blood glucose that could induce various complications. Procyanidin, a kind of polyphenol compounds existing in many plants, have shown to be effective in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes mellitus as they may lower blood glucose, moderate insulin resistance and protect islet β cells. This review focused on the research advances on the preventive and therapeutic application of procyanidin in promoting glucose absorption, protecting islet β cells, modulating intestinal microbiota and regulating diabetic complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which should provide useful reference for subsequent studies.",
