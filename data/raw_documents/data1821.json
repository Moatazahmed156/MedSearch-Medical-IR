    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history and optimal treatment for head and neck paragangliomas (PGs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our methods were the review of the pertinent literature.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PGs are rare tumors seen most commonly in the head and neck. Approximately 90% are sporadic; the remainder are familial and related to mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene complex. Most PGs are benign and slow growing; 6% to 19% are malignant, as evidenced by the development of metastases. PGs may be treated by complete resection or moderate-dose radiotherapy with a ≥90% likelihood of cure. The optimal radiotherapy dose is approximately 45 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks. The treatment modality selected depends on the risk of complications. Due to their rarity, the optimal treatment for malignant PGs is unclear.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      PGs may be treated by either complete resection or radiotherapy with a high likelihood of success. Treatment depends on the location and extent of the PG and the morbidity associated with treatment.",
