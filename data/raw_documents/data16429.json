  "title": "Prevalence of six respiratory pathogens among children in Chengdu, China: a multiplex PCR-based detection study.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections among children are commonly caused by several pathogens, and their prevalence varies across different groups. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevalence of Influenza A virus (Flu A), Influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Adenovirus (ADV), Rhinovirus (RV), and  This retrospective cross-sectional study included 39,190 children, with 21,847 males and 17,343 females. All respiratory specimens from the participants were tested for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, ADV, RV, and MP using multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of single infection, double co-infection, and triple co-infection was 48.19%, 7.09%, and 0.25%, respectively. The pathogen-specific prevalence from highest to lowest was RV (21.43%), ADV (16.69%), MP (11.73%), RSV (8.12%), Flu A (3.78%), and Flu B (1.37%). Significant differences were observed in the prevalence of the six pathogens across all six age groups (all  Over half of the children were infected with at least one of the six respiratory pathogens, with RV, ADV, and MP being predominant. While co-infections were less common than single infections, they still occurred, with double co-infections being the main form. Notably, the prevalence varied significantly by age, season, and clinical diagnosis. These findings may offer useful references for developing targeted prevention and control strategies.",
