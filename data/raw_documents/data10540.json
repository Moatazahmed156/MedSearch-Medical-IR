  "title": "Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in childhood allergic diseases: A review of the mechanisms and therapeutic advances.",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in pediatric immunology have clarified the pivotal role of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the pathophysiology of childhood allergic diseases. As key components of the innate immune system, ILC2s mediate the initiation and progression of these disorders. Their activation is triggered primarily by epithelial-derived cytokines, whose expression is highly elevated in children with allergies. Upon activation, ILC2s rapidly secrete type 2 cytokines, driving disease-specific pathogenesis. In allergic asthma, airway ILC2 expansion exacerbates eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling; in allergic rhinitis, nasal mucosal ILC2 activation induces typical symptoms; and in food allergies, intestinal mucosal ILC2s cause epithelial damage and increased permeability, promoting allergic progression. These mechanistic insights have underpinned the development of innovative therapies. Clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of treatments targeting ILC2-derived cytokines or their receptors: anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (targeting the IL-5 ligand), anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies (targeting the IL-13 ligand), and anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibodies (targeting IL-4 receptor α and blocking IL-4/IL-13 signaling) are promising treatments for specific childhood allergic diseases. Emerging strategies targeting ILC2 activation pathways and modulating the microbiome to regulate ILC2 activity are under active investigation. Collectively, the past five years of research have improved the understanding of the mechanisms underlying childhood allergic diseases and established new treatment paradigms, with great potential to optimize clinical management and improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with allergies.",
