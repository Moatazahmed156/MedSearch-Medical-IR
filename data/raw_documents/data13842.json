  "title": "Auranofin attenuates TOPBP1-mediated ATR replication stress response and improves chemotherapeutic response in breast tumor models.",
  "abstract": "Genome instability is most commonly caused by replication stress, which also renders cancer cells extremely vulnerable once their response to replication stress is impeded. Topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), an allosteric activator of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR), coordinates ATR in replication stress response and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for tumors. Here, we identify auranofin, the FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, as a lead compound capable of binding to the BRCT 7-8 domains and blocking TOPBP1 interaction with PHF8 and FANCJ. The liquid-liquid phase separation of TOPBP1 is also disrupted by auranofin. Through targeting these TOPBP1-nucleated molecular machineries, auranofin leads to an accumulation of replication defects by impairing ATR activation and attenuating replication protein A loading on perturbed replication forks, and it shows significant anti-breast tumor activity in combination with a PARP inhibitor. This study provides mechanistic insights into how auranofin challenges replication integrity and expands the application of this FDA-approved drug in breast tumor intervention.",
