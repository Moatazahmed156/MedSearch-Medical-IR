    "abstract": "Histone methylation (HMT), the enzymatic addition of methyl groups to specific histone residues by histone methyltransferases, constitutes a key regulatory mechanism in gene expression and post-translational modulation. Although studies have explored HMT's role in oncogenesis and other organ-specific disorders, HMT is now implicated in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. A broad spectrum of experimental models, including both in vivo and in vitro systems, has demonstrated the involvement of HMT alterations in diverse renal pathologies such as acute kidney injury, renal fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, kidney stones, renal cell carcinoma, and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Targeted modulation of HMT has been associated with attenuated disease progression across these conditions. This review synthesizes current insights into HMT's mechanistic roles in renal pathology and delineates its therapeutic potential as a strategic intervention in kidney disease management.",
