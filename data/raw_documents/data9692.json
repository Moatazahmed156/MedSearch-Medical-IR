  "title": "[Type 2 diabetes in patients with coronary artery disease: from an overlooked diagnosis to treatments with new glucose-lowering drugs].",
  "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although in patients with coronary artery disease T2DM has a non-negligible prevalence, it is often overlooked. Due to its prognostic impact and the availability of pharmacological intervention, as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), able to improve the prognosis, an early diagnosis is crucial. T2DM diagnosis is based on three evaluations: fasting serum glucose levels; glycate hemoglobin levels; and oral glucose tolerance test. In addition, it is important to know the clinical significance of stress-induced hyperglycemia, commonly found in patients with an acute cardiovascular event. As regards T2DM therapy, SGLT2i and GLP1-RA represent two pillars to reduce cardiovascular disease risk but, despite international guidelines, their use remains rather low in routine cardiovascular care. This review reports indications for an appropriate use of these treatments with an analysis of benefits and precautions to consider in clinical practice.",
