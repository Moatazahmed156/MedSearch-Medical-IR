    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Gastrointestinal stromal tumours are the most common mesenchymal malignancies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and gastric leiomyosarcoma represent 1-3% of gastric malignancies.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      We report a case of a 69-year-old black African man who presented with a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction and duodenal perforation. A Billroth-II gastrectomy was performed and histology confirmed a gastric leiomyosarcoma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It is important to identify the gastric leiomyosarcoma which is a variant of the more common malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours as the pathogenesis and management are currently well established. As the facilities for differentiating these are not easily available in resource-limited areas gastrointestinal stromal tumours may remain underdiagnosed and undertreated.",
