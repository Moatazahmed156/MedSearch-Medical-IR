  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) incidence, risk factors, and coexisting medical conditions following an episode of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed data from 722 patients diagnosed with PE. Group I (n = 663), consisting of individuals who did not develop CTEPD, and Group II (n = 59), comprising those who progressed to CTEPD. CTEPD were divided into two subgroups as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH, n = 23) and without pulmonary hypertension (PH) (n = 36). The groups were compared based on demographic features, comorbid conditions, risk factors, and initial systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) values. CTEPD was observed in 59 patients (8.2%). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and elevated baseline sPAP demonstrated a significant association with CTEPD (p = 0.003, p = 0.041, and p = 0.024, respectively). Immobilization was found to be significantly more prevalent in Group I (p = 0.032). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, each 1 mmHg increase in baseline sPAP was associated with a 1.04-fold elevation in the risk of CTEPD development (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.05; p < 0.001). Additionally, a 1-year decrease in age was linked to a 1.03-fold increase in the probability of developing CTEPD (95% CI: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.003). No significant differences were found between patients with CTEPH and those with CTEPD without PH. These findings highlight the important role of comorbid conditions in the development of CTEPD. It is important to optimize the clinical management of patients with such comorbidities to reduce the risk of CTEPD development.",
