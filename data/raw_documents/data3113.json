    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Predicting poor survival outcomes early in palliative chemotherapy is important to the timing of palliative care. Weight loss during chemotherapy if prognostic would lead to early palliative care.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      We collected demographics, stage, chemotherapy, chemotherapy cycles, weight, healthcare utilization, comorbidities (Charleson Comorbid Index), tumor markers, and weight changes over 60 days. We defined 3 groups of patients: 1. Weight gain to <.5% weight loss, 2. Weight loss< 2% and 3. Weight loss of >2%. A Chi-square test assessed differences in weight during treatment. Time-to-event analysis was expressed in a Kaplan Meier curve.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      93 individuals died of pancreatic cancer in 2018 and 2019. The median age was 71.2 years. Forty-three had stage I and II, 40 stages III and IV cancers, and 10 had unknown stages. Most received FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy. Thirty-six gained to lost < .5% during chemotherapy,8 lost < 2% and 49 patients lost > 2% of their weight. Mortality was available in 55 of 93 patients. Median survival was 16.6 months in those with weight gain to < .5% weight loss, 17.28 months for those with < 2% weight loss, and 20.5 months for those with > 2% weight loss (P = .42).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Weight loss over 60 days did not predict a poor prognosis in this small retrospective study; larger prospective studies may clarify the prognostic importance of weight loss during chemotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this small retrospective study, weight loss over 60 days did not predict poor survival.",
