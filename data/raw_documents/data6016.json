    "abstract": "Diabetes is a long-term chronic disease, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, has many uncertain factors. Epicardial fat, as the heart fat bank, functions as fatty tissue and is the heart's endocrine organ. The existence of diabetes affects the distribution of heart fat and promotes the secretion of adipokine. In different pathological conditions, it can promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokine, reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and even autophagy, thus affecting cardiac function. In this paper, we will elaborate on the mechanism of epicardial fat in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",
