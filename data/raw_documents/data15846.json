  "title": "Impact of COVID-19 on Abdominal Pain Presentations and Hospital Outcomes in New South Wales: Findings From the ICON Study.",
  "abstract": "To examine trends in emergency department (ED) presentations, hospital admissions, and patient outcomes for abdominal pain across New South Wales (NSW) before, during, and after the first COVID-19 lockdown. This multi-centre retrospective study analysed de-identified administrative data from NSW public hospitals. ED presentations and hospital admissions for abdominal pain were reviewed across five 31-day periods: pre-pandemic, lockdown, and 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-lockdown. A total of 35,327 abdominal pain ED presentations were identified. Presentations fell by 31.0%, from 7531 pre-pandemic to 5199 during lockdown, then increased steadily to 7942 (5.5% above baseline) at 12 months. Acuity shifted, with urgent triage cases rising from 57.6% to 61.7%, while semi-urgent cases declined. Ambulance arrivals grew from 23.4% to 28.5% during lockdown, offset by fewer walk-ins. Hospital admissions rose from 2517 at baseline to 2733 at lockdown onset, peaking at 3017 at 3 months later a 19.9% increase (χ The COVID-19 pandemic substantially altered patterns of abdominal pain presentations and hospital use, with lasting changes in acuity and admission practices.",
