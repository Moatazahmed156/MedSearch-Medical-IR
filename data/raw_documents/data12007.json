  "title": "Development of a Novel Lysosomal Gene-based Prognostic Panel and Uncovering EIF4EBP1 as a Biomarker for Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Lysosomal dysfunction is significantly associated with tumor progression. This study aimed to identify and develop a new predictive panel for breast cancer (BRCA) and examine its relationship with the immune environment and therapeutical status. We developed a prognostic panel employing lysosomal genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) and then validated and assessed it externally in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, the disparities were identified between high and low-risk subgroups by examining the infiltration of microenvironment cells, gene expression of immune checkpoints, and small molecular compounds. Ultimately, the cancerous function and potential pathway of core LRG were verified using a series of  First, the predictive panel of lysosome-related genes (LRGs) was generated  Our 9-LRG panel is a promising classifier for assessing the prognosis of BRCA. Notably, targeting EIF4EBP1 could potentially serve as a theoretical foundation for enhancing the prognosis of BRCA patients.",
