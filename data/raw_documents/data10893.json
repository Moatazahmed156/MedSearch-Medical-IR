  "title": "County-Level Influenza-Attributable Emergency Department Visits and Their Spatial Correlates in the United States: Cross-Sectional Observational Study.",
  "abstract": "The burden of seasonal influenza on emergency department (ED) visits is poorly quantified due to case ascertainment and data availability challenges. This study estimates county-level respiratory ED visits attributable to influenza using time-series models and examines spatial heterogeneity in county-level burden in 3 states. This study aimed to estimate the county-level respiratory ED visits attributable to influenza using time-series models and examine spatial heterogeneity in county-level burden in 3 states. We used daily hospital discharge records to measure community-level influenza activity in California (2005-2018), Georgia (2010-2018), and New York (2005-2018). County-level respiratory ED visit rates attributable to influenza were estimated by quasi-Poisson time-series models, adjusting for temporal trends and environmental factors. Bayesian spatial models were used to assess associations with county-level socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and chronic health condition prevalence. Influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates per 100,000 population were 226 (95% CI 206-246) in New York, 232 (95% CI 206-259) in California, and 547 (95% CI 506-589) in Georgia. A 10% increase in county-level poverty and uninsured rates was associated with higher influenza burden, increasing influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates by 160 (95% credible interval [CrI] 127-196) and 217 (95% CrI 168-265), respectively. Long-term PM Influenza-attributable respiratory ED visit rates exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity that is associated with county-level socioeconomic factors, environmental exposures, and chronic disease prevalence.",
