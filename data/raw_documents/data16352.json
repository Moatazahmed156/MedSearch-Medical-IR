  "abstract": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are associated with significant morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the causative pathogens and epidemiological characteristics of LRTIs including the factors influencing the severity of illness and the length of hospital stay (LOS). From November 2023 to June 2024, a prospective study including 121 patients was performed at four hospitals in Shenzhen, China. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from inpatients with LRTIs were strictly collected and tested using targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). A total of 108 respiratory pathogens were included in the detection list. Of the total inpatients, 89.3% tested positive for one or more pathogens (108/121). The three leading pathogens were  Different age groups of hospitalized patients showed different pathogen profiles and types of co-infection, indicating the significance of age-targeted clinical medical practice. The most common pathogens that caused LRTIs were ",
