  "title": "Mean Platelet Volume/Platelet Count Ratio is Markedly Increased in Liver Cirrhosis Compared to Hepatitis.",
  "abstract": "The mean platelet volume to platelet count ratio (MPV/PC) is a potential non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases. A total of 232 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC), and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC), along with 143 healthy controls, were analyzed. MPV and PC were measured within 2 hours using an ADVIA 2120 analyzer. ANOVA and ROC analyses evaluated group differences and diagnostic performance. MPV/PC was significantly elevated in NALC and ALC compared to CHB, CHC, and controls (p < 0.001). ROC analysis for cirrhosis showed 88.3% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity (AUC = 0.946). MPV/PC is significantly increased in liver cirrhosis regardless of etiology, suggesting disrupted platelet homeostasis. It may serve as a sensitive, non-invasive marker for fibrosis. Further validation incorporating fibrosis biomarkers is recommended.",
