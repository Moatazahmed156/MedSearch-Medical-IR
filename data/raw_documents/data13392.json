  "abstract": "Though previous research supports diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a biomarker for white matter integrity in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (ADMCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), few studies have compared white matter microstructure between different neurodegenerative aetiologies. This study aimed to characterize and compare the microstructure of white matter tracts in ADMCI, PD, and CVD patients using DTI data from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI). The ONDRI study included 119 ADMCI, 149 CVD, and 137 PD patients with usable DTI and T 3D segmentations of the 39 white matter tracts in a representative subject are shown in Figure 1. In the multivariate analyses, diagnosis had a strong, significant effect on all four DTI metrics (FA: p = 0.002, ηp PD participants had slightly more preserved white matter tract microstructural integrity than ADMCI or CVD participants who had lower FA and higher RD and MD values. Higher-quality, advanced diffusion imaging may be necessary to detect the more subtle changes in white matter microstructure present in Parkinson's disease patients.",
