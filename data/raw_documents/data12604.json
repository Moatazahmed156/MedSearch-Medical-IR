  "title": "Cryptotanshinone targets tumor-immune-microbiome axis to suppress colorectal cancer.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression involves complex interactions between tumor cells, immune evasion, and metabolic reprogramming. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), a bioactive diterpenoid from  We employed both  CTS exerted potent anti-CRC effects, suppressing tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis  CTS effectively suppresses CRC progression. Its efficacy is associated with the coordinated modulation of the tumor-immune-microbiome axis, involving direct cytotoxicity, reduced PD-1+ T cell levels, and restructuring of the gut microbial community. These results highlight CTS as a promising multi-faceted therapeutic candidate and provide a preclinical rationale for its further development.",
