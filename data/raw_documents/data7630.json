    "abstract": "Integrated energy services (IESs) are a systematic improvement and structural optimization of energy from production to consumption. However, many studies on IESs have only focused on typical cases or engineering technologies. In this study, we adopted a qualitative analysis research method to qualitatively analyze 21 important policy documents related to IESs in China from 2015 to 2022. The research provides an overview of the policy landscape and the key incentives for IESs implementation in China, identifies the challenges and opportunities for further expansion of IESs beyond industrial parks, then discuss the implications for future research and policy development. The research of the policy documents reveals that IESs as a means to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, provides a deeper understanding of the potential of IESs in promoting energy security and mitigating climate change in China and the world, and strives to bridge the gap between IESs engineering sciences and social sciences.",
