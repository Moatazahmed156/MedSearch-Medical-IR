    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a serious and devastating condition. Recently, research into microRNAs (miRNAs) has become increasingly exhaustive and it has been determined that they are closely related to the pathophysiological processes of spinal cord injury. They participate in the regulation of the inflammatory response of spinal cord injury, the death of neuronal cells, and the repair of neural functions, which are related to the recovery of spinal cord injury. This review focuses on the relationship between miRNA and spinal cord injury, lists miRNA-324-5p, miRNA-221 and miRNA-124, which are helpful for the repair of spinal cord injury, and finally summarizes the current research progress of miRNA-based therapies, so as to provide a foundational reference for clinical and scientific researchers.",
