    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To investigate sleep quality among individuals incarcerated in a rural county jail, by housing status before incarceration.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using cross-sectional survey methods, 194 individuals incarcerated in jail reported sleep quality prior to and during incarceration on a Likert scale and pre-incarceration housing status (ie, house, apartment, motel, group living, or homeless). Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using log binomial regression to determine associations between housing status before incarceration and changes in sleep quality.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants in non-permanent housing before incarceration had a lower prevalence of worsening sleep quality while incarcerated (compared to stable or improving) compared to those in permanent housing before incarceration (PR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.77).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pre-incarceration housing is associated with change in sleep quality among individuals incarcerated in jail. Jail may be an important point of intervention to improve sleep quality during incarceration and through connecting individuals to more stable living conditions.",
