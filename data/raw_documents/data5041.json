    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. A variety of treatment options is available for localized prostate cancer and may range from active surveillance to focal therapy or whole gland treatment, that is, surgery or radiotherapy. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels are an important tool to monitor treatment success after whole gland treatment, unfortunately prostate-specific antigen is unreliable after focal therapy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate is rapidly gaining field in the management of prostate cancer and may play a crucial role in the evaluation of recurrent prostate cancer. This article will focus on postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging after different forms of local therapy in patients with prostate cancer.",
