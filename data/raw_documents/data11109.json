  "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Dongtian Changchun ointment (, DTCO) for the treatment of patients with stable moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This was a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients with COPD who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly divided into a DTCO group and a control group in a 1∶1 ratio. Both groups were treated with Symbicort Turbuhaler (320 μg / 9 μg twice daily) for 48 weeks. The DTCO group was given additional DTCO (15 g twice daily) for the first 12 weeks. Outcome assessments were conducted at five time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. Primary outcome measures included frequency and duration of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Secondary outcomes included St. George's Breathing Questionnaire, pulmonary function, 6-min walk test, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores. A total of 84 patients were randomly divided into the DTCO group ( DTCO significantly reduced the frequency and duration of AECOPD in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, and demonstrated satisfactory safety.",
