  "title": "Quercetin Feeding Ameliorates Increased Erythrocyte Syndecan-3 Expression in Dyslipidemic and Diabetic Rats and Correlates to Erythrocyte Adhesion.",
  "abstract": "Our earlier study demonstrated that metabolic disorders increase the expression of Syndecan-3 (Sdc-3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in erythrocytes, contributing to adhesion through the glycosaminoglycan chain. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be one of the factors for increased expression. This study aimed to determine whether quercetin, a bioactive antioxidant commonly found in food, could modulate Sdc-3 expression. Male Wistar rats were made dyslipidemic and diabetic, after which they were treated with quercetin at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight for a duration of 2 months. Sdc-3 expression in erythrocytes was assessed by Western blot, and erythrocyte adhesion to fibronectin was evaluated in-vitro. The quercetin-supplemented diet reduced circulating lipids, blood glucose, and MDA levels, mitigated changes in Sdc-3 expression, and decreased erythrocyte adhesion to fibronectin. These effects may be attributed to quercetin's antioxidant properties, as was seen by the positive correlation between MDA levels and Sdc-3 expression. Sdc-3 levels in erythrocytes could serve as a prognostic marker for assessing the impact of dietary compounds on complications linked to metabolic disorders.",
