    "abstract": "'What's in a name? That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet.' (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare). Shakespeare's implication is that a name is nothing but a word and it therefore represents a convention with no intrinsic meaning. Whilst this may be relevant to romantic literature, disease names do have real meanings, and consequences, in medicine. Hence, there must be a very good rationale for changing the name of a disease that has a centuries-old historical context. A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology, nephrology and pediatric societies now proposes changing the name of 'diabetes insipidus' to 'arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D)' for central etiologies and 'arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R)' for nephrogenic etiologies. This editorial provides both the historical context and the rationale for this proposed name change.",
