  "abstract": "For people living with HIV (PLWH) and tuberculous meningitis (TBM), current studies on risk stratification and poor prognosis lack a clear optimal threshold. To address this gap, this study aims to identify an optimal immunological threshold for risk stratification and explore predictors of poor prognosis in this population. We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study enrolling PLWH with TBM from hospitals across eight provinces of China between January 2018 and December 2020. We extracted the demographic and clinical data, discharge outcomes, Medical Research Council staging and CD4 A total of 201 participants were included in the study. Of these, 173 (86.1%) improved with treatment. Restricted cubic spline analysis identified CD4 In PLWH with TBM, a CD4",
