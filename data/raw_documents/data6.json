    "abstract": "Regular physical activity contributes to both maintaining and improving health, and is important for human development throughout the entire lifespan of a person. There is strong evidence for the beneficial effects of physical activity on health, in the areas of all-cause mortality, cancer, cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal health, metabolic health, and neurocognitive health. Physical activity includes any form of movement in which the contraction of skeletal muscles results in an increase in energy consumption. It is quantified and controlled via the frequency, duration, intensity, and weekly extent. All those forms of movement that improve health and in which the risk of injury is low are defined as health-enhancing physical activity. The Austrian recommendations for health-enhancing physical activity include endurance-oriented movement, plus strength and coordination training. Exercise is aimed at initiating adaptation processes, in order to improve functionality. Therefore, it has to be adapted to the different levels of individual performance ability, activity levels, and age, and should be carried out according to certain principles. Exercise leads to a positive change in physiological parameters, which in turn are closely linked to an improvement in the state of health. Through regular endurance-oriented and muscle-strengthening physical activity, far-reaching health effects can be achieved. Nevertheless, undesirable events can occur during activity, and the musculoskeletal and circulatory systems can be particularly affected. However, through adequate preparation, suitable equipment, and appropriate exercise, the personal and also the public health benefits of physical activity and sport can be increased.",
