  "title": "Home intravenous antibiotics for cystic fibrosis - setting up a hospital @home service.",
  "abstract": "This paper reviews the use of home intravenous antibiotics (IVABs) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We outline a program we developed during the COVID-19 pandemic for enhancing the experience for children and families by involving full multidisciplinary follow up via video for the duration of the antibiotic course. We did find though, that the majority of families were unsuitable for home IVABs. We hope that this information will be useful for other CF units considering setting up a hospital at home service.",
