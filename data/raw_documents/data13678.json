  "title": "Comparison of Opioid Utilization in Older Adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis before and after Initiating Biological or Targeted Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs.",
  "abstract": "Opioid use is common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for pain management; however, evidence of opioid-associated adverse events is increasing. While biological (b) or targeted synthetic (ts) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) improve functional outcomes such as pain, little is known about their impact on opioid utilization patterns. This study investigated opioid utilization before and after b/tsDMARD initiation and assessed effect modification by sex. Using 5% Medicare claims data from 2012 to 2020, this cohort study included older adults (≥ 65 years) with RA who initiated b/tsDMARDs (first prescription = index date), and had continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D, but not Part C enrollment, during 12 months before and after initiation. The outcomes of interest were any opioid use and long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). McNemar's test was performed to compare outcomes before and after b/tsDMARD initiation. Sex-based differences in changes in opioid use after b/tsDMARD initiation were also evaluated. The study cohort included 3585 individuals with RA initiating b/tsDMARDs; most were female (75.87%) with a mean (SD) age of 73.15 (5.99) years. Following b/tsDMARD initiation, any opioid use decreased significantly from 2094 (58.41%) to 2017 (56.26%) (p = 0.015). However, LTOT use increased significantly from 733 (20.45%) to 900 (25.10%) (p < 0.001), following b/tsDMARD initiation. No evidence of sex differences in the association between b/tsDMARD initiation and opioid utilization was identified. Initiating b/tsDMARDs was associated with a modest reduction in any opioid use. However, LTOT use in RA remained persistently high. The impact of different b/tsDMARD initiation on opioid utilization patterns needs further investigation.",
