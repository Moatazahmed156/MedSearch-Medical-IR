    "abstract": "The cardiovascular epidemiologist, Jeremy Morris, called physical activity \"the best bargain in public health,\" but few clinicians use exercise and physical activity in their practice. Clinicians should routinely inquire about physical activity and recommend that patients achieve the minimal levels recommended by the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Clinician should avoid unnecessary testing that discourages patients from an active lifestyle. Patients after myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, or the diagnosis of heart failure or claudication should be referred to an exercise-based cardiac rehab program. Physical activity and exercise training may be a clinical bargain, but as all medicines must be used to be effective.",
