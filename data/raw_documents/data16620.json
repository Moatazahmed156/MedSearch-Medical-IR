  "title": "Comparison of clinical outcomes of oseltamivir versus baloxavir in outpatients with influenza: a retrospective cohort analysis.",
  "abstract": "Background We compared all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and emergency department (ED) visit rates among 73,899 influenza outpatients treated with oseltamivir and 1,592 patients treated with baloxavir. Methods Data were drawn from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, which comprises 69 healthcare organizations and includes patients recorded between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2023. Subsequently, 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was applied between the two groups in order to further control for baseline differences and potential confounders. Results The patients treated with baloxavir displayed significantly lower rates of 1-, 3-, and 6-month hospitalization(1.6%, 3.7%, 5.3% vs 0.6%, 0.6% 0.8%) and 1-, 3-, and 6-month ED visits(1.8%, 4.4%, 7.2vs 1.5%, 3.5% 5.0%) versus those treated with oseltamivir. The all-cause hospitalization was 5.3% for oseltamivir users and 0.8% for baloxavir users (HR 6.49; 95% CI, 3.55-11.90), emergency department visits were 7.2% versus 5.0% (HR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78), and mortality was 0.6% for both groups (HR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.14-6.78). Conclusions The outpatients with treatment of baloxavir have lower hospitalization rates and emergency department visits. Mortality rates were nearly identical between groups, showing no significant difference.",
