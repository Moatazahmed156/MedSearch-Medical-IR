  "title": "Epilepsia Partialis Continua in a Post-stroke Patient: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "We report a case of continuous, involuntary jerky movements involving the right upper extremity in a patient with a prior cerebrovascular accident affecting the same side years prior to the discussed admission. The patient had persistent regular jerky movements, without loss of consciousness or generalized convulsions, which raised suspicion for epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), a rare form of focal status epilepticus characterized by continuous motor seizures affecting one part of the body. Recognition of EPC is critical and requires high clinical suspicion, as imaging (CT, MRI) or EEG may not show any specific findings or pathologies. This can lead to delays in appropriate antiepileptic management, noting that EPC requires polytherapy of multiple antiepileptic drugs while addressing the leading cause. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for EPC in a patient with focal motor activity following stroke and underscores the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent further neuronal injury.",
