  "title": "A fully automated model to form \"dry surface biofilms\" under optimal dehydration conditions. application to Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings.",
  "abstract": "Over ten years ago, bacteria attached to surfaces and surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances were observed on dry surfaces in intensive care units. These structures were named \"dry surface biofilms\" (DSBs). Most in vitro models used to study \"DSBs\" alternate long hydration phases with short periods of desiccation, producing \"semi-dehydrated DSBs\" that differ from the conditions in healthcare settings. Our aim was to create a model that could produce \"DSBs\" under optimal dehydration conditions and apply it to Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria are commonly responsible for healthcare-associated infections in our hospital, yet they have received little attention in the context of \"DSBs.\" We developed a fully automated model that mimics the splashing of respiratory secretions by repeatedly nebulizing an inoculum of contaminated artificial saliva. Hydration phases lasted 2 s every 6 h. We investigated the microscopic aspect, mean surface coverage, bacterial culturability and membrane integrity. After validating the model with methicillin-resistant ",
