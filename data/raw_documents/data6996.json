    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide from gynecological malignancies, mainly because there are few early symptoms and the disease is generally diagnosed at an advanced stage. In addition, despite the effectiveness of cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer and the high response rates to chemotherapy, survival has improved little over the last 20 years. The management of patients with ovarian cancer also remains similar despite studies showing striking differences and heterogeneity among different subtypes. It is therefore clear that novel targeted therapeutics are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes for ovarian cancer. To that end, several membrane receptors associated with pivotal cellular processes and often aberrantly overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells have emerged as potential targets for receptor-mediated therapeutic strategies including specific agents and multifunctional delivery systems based on ligand-receptor binding. This review focuses on the profiles and potentials of such strategies proposed for ovarian cancer treatment and imaging.",
