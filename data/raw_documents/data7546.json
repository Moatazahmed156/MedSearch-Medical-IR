    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a powerful tool for evaluation and management of patients with Crohn disease. Changes of active inflammation of the small bowel can reliably and reproducibly be detected and monitored. Findings indicative of active inflammation include bowel wall thickening, intramural edema and mural hyperenhancement. These changes are most commonly reported qualitatively; however, quantitative indices have also been developed and validated to measure and monitor inflammation both for clinical care and research purposes. This article describes the essential findings of active inflammation on MRE as well as the fundamentals of both qualitative and quantitative assessment and reporting.",
