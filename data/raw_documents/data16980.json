  "title": "Astrocyte S1P1 regulates mitochondrial autophagy in inflammation and neuronal injury after epilepsy.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism by which sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) regulates mitochondrial autophagy through PHB2, thereby exacerbating inflammation and nerve damage after epilepsy. This study investigated the mechanisms of S1P1 and PHB2 in neuroinflammation and neuronal damage caused by epilepsy using in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, a magnesium-free epilepsy model was established to induce synchronous epileptic activity. In vivo, a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model was used with S1P1 agonists (SEW2871) and inhibitors (W146). Protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting, qPCR, and immunofluorescence for gene expression, autophagy and inflammatory markers. NBT staining measured superoxide anion production, while ATP and DCFDA assays assessed ATP and ROS levels. Patch clamp techniques measured neuronal excitability. Behavioral tests included open field tests and EEG recordings to evaluate seizure activity and behavioral deficits. PHB2 expression was significantly upregulated in epileptic astrocytes, leading to increased mitochondrial autophagy and enhanced oxidative stress. Knocking out PHB2 reduced autophagy flux and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its role in exacerbating inflammation. S1P1-PHB2 pathway activation upregulated both S1P1 and PHB2, promoting mitochondrial autophagy and neuroinflammation, which exacerbated epilepsy symptoms. S1P1-PHB2 axis plays a crucial role in the neuroinflammation and neurodamage caused by epilepsy. S1P1, through PHB2, promotes mitochondrial autophagy, increases oxidative stress and releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby leading to neural damage. By using the S1P1 antagonist W146 to inhibit autophagy and inflammatory responses, these effects can be alleviated.",
