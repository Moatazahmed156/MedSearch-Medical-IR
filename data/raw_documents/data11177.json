  "title": "The role of preoperative lung rehabilitation training combined with nutritional intervention on surgical tolerance and accelerated recovery indicators in patients with moderate to severe COPD complicated with lung cancer.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly coexist simultaneously and individuals with COPD are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Nutritional intervention has a restorative effect on COPD combined with lung cancer, but there is almost no research on lung rehabilitation training, and there are even fewer studies on the combination of the two. Our study aimed to assess the role of preoperative lung rehabilitation training plus nutritional intervention on surgical tolerance and accelerated recovery indicators in patients with moderate to severe COPD complicated with lung cancer. A total of 92 patients with COPD complicated by lung cancer who underwent surgery at our hospital between February 2023 and March 2024 were enrolled. Using a block randomization method, patients were divided into two groups: the control group ( After intervention, the observation group showed significantly higher levels of FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MVV%, DLCO, and 6MWD compared with the control group, while the MMRC score was significantly lower (all  Preoperative lung rehabilitation training combined with nutritional intervention can effectively improve pulmonary function and respiratory function in patients with moderate to severe COPD complicated by lung cancer, enhance their surgical tolerance, improve quality of life, and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications.",
