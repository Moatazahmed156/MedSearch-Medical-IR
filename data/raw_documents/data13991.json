  "abstract": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the second most frequent inflammatory rheumatic disease in older adults, after rheumatoid arthritis. Recommendations for the management of PMR, developed by the German, Austrian, Swiss societies of rheumatology and other organizations were published in 2018. These recommendations are now updated based on a systematic literature search that covered the evidence published between July 2016 and January 2024 on therapeutic interventions and prognostic factors for PMR. The search string followed that used in the original recommendations, with an extension for targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Based on evidence and expert opinions, the task force (12 physicians, 2 healthcare professionals and 2 patients from 3 countries) developed a set of 4 overarching principles and 7 specific recommendations. The current update reiterates previous guideline recommendations for glucocorticoids (15-25 mg prednisone equivalents per day) as initial treatment for PMR once diagnosis has been confirmed, with subsequent tapering over 4-12 months (depending on whether a glucocorticoid sparing agent is used), with monitoring of disease activity and treatment related adverse effects. Interleukin-6 receptor blocking agents should be considered in addition to glucocorticoids in patients with relapsing disease, and can be considered in patients with new-onset PMR at high risk for glucocorticoid-related adverse events. Methotrexate or rituximab may be alternatives. Older and frail patients should also be offered an individualized exercise program. These updated recommendations should serve as an aid to evidence-based decisions ensuring high-quality care for all patients with PMR.",
