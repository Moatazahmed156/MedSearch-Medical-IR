  "title": "Targeting Regulated Cell Death Pathways in COPD: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Strategies.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease defined by persistent airflow limitation, chronic inflammation, and ongoing airway remodeling, and poses a substantial global health challenge. Despite its clinical significance, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Regulated cell death (RCD) incorporates various kinds of cell death that are typically regulated by specific molecular pathways. Numerous new kinds of RCD have been identified outside of the traditional apoptotic pathway, like necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, cuproptosis, and parthanatos. To date, there is growing evidence indicating that these pathways participate in the regulation of COPD development. However, their specific roles and therapeutic relevance remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss a summary of the molecular mechanisms by which RCD pathways influence the onset and advancement of COPD. Additionally, the therapeutic benefits of agents that target these cell death pathways in COPD treatment were described. By integrating current insights, this review aims to broaden our knowledge of the pathophysiology of COPD and offer novel approaches to treatment.",
