    "abstract": "Background: Qualitative research involves the analysis of data in various forms (i.e., written text such as interview transcripts, literature, or a personal diary; visual media such as photographs, maps, or memes; and audio materials such as podcasts, music, or voice notes) to describe and/or interpret phenomena and humans' perceptions and experiences of the world, including of food, health, and well-being. Dietetic-scholars have raised concerns about the dearth and quality of qualitative dietetic research.Objective: To document the availability and quality of qualitative research published in Canadian dietetic literature.Methods: A manifest content analysis of articles published in the Canadian Journal of Dietetic Research and Practice (CJDRP) between 2012 and 2021.Results: In total, 340 articles were published between 2012 and 2021 of which 43 (12.6%) used qualitative methods. Overall, the quality of qualitative articles was poor; articles frequently failed to report the methodological approach or a theoretical framework. Methods of data collection, data analysis, and strategies to ensure rigor were seldom described in detail. Reported limitations were often inappropriate for qualitative research.Discussion: Qualitative research is markedly underrepresented in the CJDPR. Efforts are needed to ensure that high-quality qualitative research evidence and publishing opportunities are available to Canadian dietetic practitioners and researchers. This study provides baseline data to evaluate the impact of future efforts.",
