    "abstract": "Colonic skip lesions are typically described in Crohn's colitis, but this phenomenon has been recognized in ulcerative colitis (skipped appendiceal involvement), Behcet's colitis, cytomegaloviral colitis, and even in Aeromonas hydrophilia and Histoplasma capsulatum infection. However, skip lesions in typhoid ileo-colitis have not been reported in the English-language literature. We report herein a patient with skip ulcers due to typhoid fever.",
