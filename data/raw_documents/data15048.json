  "abstract": "Intestinal barrier dysfunction and microRNA dysregulation are proposed contributors to progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to assess selected protein and miRNA biomarkers of intestinal permeability in relation to MASLD severity. We included 104 patients with MASLD and 57 healthy controls. Serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), diamine oxidase (DAO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and miRNAs (miR-21, miR-29a, miR-122) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of steatosis and fibrosis severity. Patients with MASLD showed higher LBP levels (",
