  "abstract": "Clinical responses of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatments vary considerably due to the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME), where intratumoral microbiota may reshape the unique inflammation imprints. However, its complex mechanistic underpinnings remain incompletely elucidated. Herein, we sought to delineate the critical role of intratumoral microbiota in potentiating combination therapeutics against CRC. By comparing germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mouse models of 33 potential CRC treatments, we screened out capecitabine-MIH4 (anti-PD-1 antibody) combination regimen significantly augmented by intratumoral microbiota in tumor regression. The enrichment of enterotoxigenic ",
