  "abstract": "Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activation contributes to tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), yet clinical attempts to target this pathway have been unsuccessful. TRAF2 and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK), an essential nuclear activator of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, has not yet been validated as a viable therapeutic target in SCLC. Here, we validated that TNIK inhibition is a promising approach for personalized anti-cancer therapy in SCLC. We correlated the IC50 values of a TNIK inhibitor, NCB-0846 with proteomic profiling (Reverse Phase Protein Array, RPPA) data across 28 SCLC cell lines. Cytokine array analysis was performed to quantify changes in 105 cytokines following TNIK inhibitor treatment. We identified c-MYC expression as a top candidate marker of TNIK inhibition response. In xenograft models of c-MYC TNIK inhibition is more effective in c-MYC",
