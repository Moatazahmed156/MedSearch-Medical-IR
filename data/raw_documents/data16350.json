  "title": "A 15-year population-based study on incidence and vaccination coverage in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in Italy.",
  "abstract": "The incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide, particularly after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As children with IBD are at higher risk of infection, adherence to vaccination schedules is essential. However, data on the incidence of IBD and vaccination coverage in Italian children remain limited. To assess the incidence of IBD in children aged 0-14 years in the Apulia region of Italy (2009-2023) and to evaluate their vaccination coverage for both mandatory and recommended vaccines. A retrospective population-based study was conducted using hospital discharge records and a user fee exemption registry to identify incident IBD cases. Vaccination history was obtained from the regional immunization system. Age-standardized incidence rates (SIRs) were calculated. Vaccination coverage was assessed based on the receipt of all age-appropriate vaccines according to regional immunization schedules. Between 2009 and 2023, 1044 incident pediatric IBD cases were identified, with an average annual SIR of 12.7/100 000. A significant increase in incidence occurred after 2020 ( The incidence of pediatric IBD is increasing in Apulia, whereas vaccination coverage remains below optimal levels. Targeted strategies are needed to enhance immunization in this vulnerable population.",
