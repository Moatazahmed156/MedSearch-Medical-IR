    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) poses clinical challenges because of its heterogeneous categories of chronic arthritis. Although conventional radiography aids with assessment of joint damage, MRI and ultrasound offer more sensitive evaluation of joint changes related to inflammation and damage in JIA. MRI and ultrasound have the potential to complement clinical assessment, monitor inflammation and damage, guide treatment decisions, and improve outcomes in JIA. Future research aims to enhance standardization and reliability and bolster the predictive value of imaging in clinical practice.",
