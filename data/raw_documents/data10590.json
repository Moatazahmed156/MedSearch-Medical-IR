  "title": "Community partners identified implementation considerations prior to a randomized clinical trial for uncontrolled asthma in Federally Qualified Health Centers.",
  "abstract": "Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) are critically important in addressing the unmet healthcare needs of individuals impacted by poverty. We used implementation science frameworks to advance understanding of perceived and actual facilitators and barriers to a novel asthma intervention before initiating a FQHC practice-based clinical trial. Interviews with clinicians and administrators explored pre-implementation trial considerations. Transcripts were inductively coded using conventional content analysis. Sixteen administrators and/or clinicians (88% female; mean age 49 ± 12.21; 44% Black race; 25% Hispanic ethnicity) from four FQHCs participated. Themes included (1) multi-level factors making successful implementation more or less likely, (2) pandemic-specific concerns with implications for current healthcare delivery challenges, and (3) unintended implementation consequences. Participants were optimistic about the likelihood of successful intervention implementation if challenges were recognized and managed. Combined with other planned assessments, this data may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of clinical trial implementation in FQHCs.",
