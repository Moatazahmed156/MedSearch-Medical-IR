  "abstract": "Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) contribute to the advancement of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through enhanced metabolic reprogramming. This research focused on exploring the role and underlying mechanism of ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) in modulating the glycolysis and activation of RA-FLSs. Here, we identified that knockdown of USP5 in RA rats reduced synovial inflammation and glycolytic activity, as evidenced by decreased serum lactate levels and GLUT1 expression. In RA-FLSs, USP5 knockdown or treatment with 2-DG reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cytokine production, and glycolysis, while increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, USP5 stabilized METTL14 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, while METTL14 enhanced the m",
