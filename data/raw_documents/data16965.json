  "title": "A microfluidic biomimetic system from the blood-brain barrier to activated microglia towards anti-Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy drug screening.",
  "abstract": "The development of drugs for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is hampered by the absence of preclinical models that can concurrently evaluate blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and target efficacy. To bridge critical gaps in preclinical screening, we developed an integrated microfluidic µBBB-(KA-MG)-mTLE chip that simultaneously models a perfusable human BBB under physiological shear stress (0.03-2.04 dyn/cm",
