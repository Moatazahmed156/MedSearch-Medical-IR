  "title": "Diabetes management cascade in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.",
  "abstract": "This study aims to determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance among the adult population in Ulaanbaatar, identify gaps in clinical care by assessing awareness, treatment, and control of the disease, and examine the trends in diabetes risk factors. A representative sample of 2,169 adults aged 20 years and older from 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar was randomly selected for a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018. Physical measurements were taken, and data were collected using the Mongolian version of the World Health Organization Instrument for Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS). The overall prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 20 and above was 6.27% (n = 136). Diabetes prevalence was significantly higher in men 7.5% (n = 73), than in women (5.3% (n = 63). OR=1.63, P < .007). Among those with diabetes, 48.5% were unaware of their condition, 15.4% were diagnosed but untreated, 30.2% were treated but uncontrolled, and only 5.9% achieved glycemic control. A major challenge in diabetes control in Ulaanbaatar is the low awareness and poor care-seeking behavior, especially among younger men. This reflects systematic and social challenges surrounding diabetes management in Mongolia. Further research is needed to explore barriers and opportunities to improve awareness and care.",
