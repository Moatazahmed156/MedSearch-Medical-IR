  "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the malignancy with the highest mortality worldwide. Circular RNA polo-like kinase 1 (circPLK1) is a circular RNA that involved in cancer progression. However, the role of circPLK1 in NSCLC requires further investigation. The expression of circPLK1 in NSCLC cells was measured by using qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify miRNAs that bind to circPLK1 and the target mRNAs of these miRNAs. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays, respectively. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Xenograft models were established to verify the regulatory role of circPLK1 in the miR-1294/SLC16A9 axis. circPLK1 was upregulaterd in NSCLC cells. Silencing circPLK1 markedly inhibited cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while accelerating apoptosis in NSCLC cells. circPLK1 acted as a sponge for miR-1294 and promoted SLC16A9 expression in NSCLC cells. Knockdown of circPLK1 suppressed tumor growth in NSCLC by regulating the miR-1294/SLC16A9 axis. circPLK1 silence inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells by regulating the miR-1294/SLC16A9 axis.",
