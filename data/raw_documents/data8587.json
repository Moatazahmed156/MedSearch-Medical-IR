    "abstract": "Wound healing can lead to complex clinical problems, hence finding an efficient approach to enhance the healing process is necessary. An ideal wound dressing should treat wounds at reasonable costs, with minimal inconveniences for the patient. Chitosan is one of the most investigated biopolymers for wound healing applications due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and antimicrobial activity. Moreover, chitosan and its derivative have attracted numerous attentions because of the accelerating wound healing, and easy processability into different forms (gels, foams, membranes, and beads). All these properties make chitosan-based materials particularly versatile and promising for wound dressings. Besides, secondary natural metabolites could potentially act like the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents and accelerate the healing process. This review collected almost all studies regarding natural compounds applications in wound healing by focusing on the chitosan-based bioactive wound dressing systems. An accurate analysis of different chitosan formulations and the influence of bioactive compounds on their wound healing properties are reported.",
