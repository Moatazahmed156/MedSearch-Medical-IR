    "abstract": "Climate change negatively threatens mental health through acute, chronic, indirect, and vicarious pathways. Though these psychological consequences will be felt globally, specific populations are at increased risk. This article describes the complex and diverse ways in which climate change can affect mental health and the resulting challenges that health care services will inevitably face. In responding to these threats, both prevention and intervention are urgently needed. Although mitigating the extent of climate change is crucial, we can also foster resilience to climate change-the ability to manage, respond to, and prepare for climate-related adversity-at the systemic, community, and individual levels. The mental health field must prepare for the significant burden that climate change will place on population health and well-being in the long term. In this review, we aim to inform and provide examples of how decision makers, the mental health discipline, and mental health professionals can respond.",
