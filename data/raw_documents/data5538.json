    "abstract": "Patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer often suffer from malnutrition, which can have an impact on quality of life, increase the toxicity of chemotherapy and reduce overall survival. Options available to the clinician to manage a patient's nutritional status include screening and assessment of malnutrition at diagnosis, monitoring during the 'cancer journey', early detection of precachexia and the ongoing use of a multidisciplinary team (oncologists, other medical specialists and nutritionists). Because malnutrition is frequently overlooked and under treated in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, this narrative review focuses on the clinical meaning of nutritional status in gastric cancer and provides general guidance regarding nutritional care management for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.",
