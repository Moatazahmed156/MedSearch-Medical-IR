  "title": "Effects of zibotentan and dapagliflozin combined in patients with compensated cirrhosis: A randomized placebo-controlled exploratory study.",
  "abstract": "Endothelin A (ET Patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) were randomized 1:1 to zibotentan 2.5 mg plus dapagliflozin 10 mg (zibo/dapa) or placebo in a 6-week parallel, double-blind Phase II study. The absolute change in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) from baseline to week 6 was evaluated in the full analysis set using analysis of covariance. In 28 participants (n = 14 per group), median age was 64 years (range: 37-78), common causes of cirrhosis were metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic (46%) or alcohol-associated liver disease (39%), and 46% were receiving stable doses of non-selective beta-blockers. Baseline HVPG was 6.5-19 mmHg, and 16/28 had clinically significant portal hypertension. Absolute change in HVPG at week 6 was not different between groups (1.02 mmHg [90% CI -0.31, 2.35]). There was a trend towards decreased HVPG in patients with baseline HVPG ≥12 mmHg receiving zibo/dapa. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also reduced by zibo/dapa vs. placebo. Three mild adverse events (peripheral oedema) were reported (zibotentan/dapagliflozin, n = 2; placebo, n = 1). No serious adverse events or drug-induced liver injuries were observed. Combined zibo/dapa was well tolerated and had a good safety profile in patients with compensated cirrhosis, but had no conclusive effect on HVPG.",
