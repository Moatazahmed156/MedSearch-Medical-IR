  "title": "Barriers to and Facilitators of Phosphate Control in Children With CKD.",
  "abstract": "Managing mineral and bone disorder in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires control of serum phosphate levels. However, hyperphosphatemia is common, particularly in adolescents, reflecting suboptimal adherence to phosphate-binder medications and a reduced phosphate diet. We explored phosphate-related knowledge and adherence barriers in children, and their caregivers, using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods study design. Children aged 8 to 18 years with CKD stages 4 and 5, on dialysis or post-transplantation, and caregivers, were recruited from 3 UK pediatric kidney centers. The Phosphate Understanding and Knowledge Assessment questionnaire was used to assess knowledge. Online focus groups explored real-world challenges to phosphate control. Forty-eight children and 43 caregivers were recruited; 44 (92%) children and 33 (75%) caregivers completed the questionnaire. Median knowledge scores were 64.3% (interquartile range, 55.3-78.6) for children and 72.7% (interquartile range, 64.3-85.7) for caregivers ( In pediatric CKD, poor adherence to phosphate advice originates more from social and practical barriers than knowledge deficits. Our findings can inform personalized strategies to improve adherence in real-world settings.",
