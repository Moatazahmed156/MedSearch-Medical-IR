    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Many experimental and clinical studies are conducted to investigate the effects of various applications of botulinum toxin (BTx) in the treatment of radiation related side effects. There are no studies that show clear results about the positive and negative effects of its active clinical use in the long run, and discussions are ongoing. In addition, there is a need for various researches about how BTx can be used and how long it can be used, and the side effects it may cause. BTx-A, which is one of the options in the treatment of side effects that will occur due to radiotherapy, is an effective and safe option. Applying BTx injection to the right place with specific injection methods increases the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      It has been investigated whether BTx will be a potential tool to perfect the esthetic and functional results in reducing the chronic side effects associated with radiotherapy.",
