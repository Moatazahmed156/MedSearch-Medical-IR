Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis/mucositis, and dermatologic and cardiovascular effects are common. Strategies such as dietary changes, over-the-counter remedies, and dose modification can be used to counteract these mild effects.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for nursing practice:\n        \n      \n      The oncology nurse should be aware of common adverse events associated with antineoplastic agents, recognize early side-effect signs, and be ready with effective strategies to mitigate side effects when and if they occur.",
