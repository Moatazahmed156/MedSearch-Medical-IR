  "title": "Assessment of School-going Children for 2Ds and Adolescent Health using RBSK Screening Tool in East Singhbhum District of Jharkhand - A Comparative Cross-sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) was established in 2013 to screen and manage birth defects, deficiencies, diseases, and developmental delays, including disabilities in Indian children, with the assistance of certified mobile health teams and grassroots workers nationwide. This study assessed the prevalence of 2Ds and adolescent health conditions per the RBSK and examined links between biosocial factors and health issues among school-aged children and adolescents in East Singhbhum, Jharkhand. A sample of 210 students, 105 from government and 105 from private schools, was surveyed. Data were collected using a predesigned, semi-structured questionnaire that included biosocial details, the RBSK screening tool for ages 6-18 years, and an adolescent-specific questionnaire. The results of the study showed that the prevalence of diseases and deficiencies was 39.5% and 32.0%, respectively, in school-going children aged 10-18 years. The prevalence of anemia, vitamin-A deficiency, vitamin-D deficiency, goiter, and edema was 28.1%, 3.8%, 2.9%, 3.3%, and 1.4%, respectively in the study population. The prevalence of convulsive disorders, Otitis Media, dental conditions, skin conditions, and asthma was 3.8%, 4.3%, 11.0%, 7.6%, and 5.2%, respectively. In addition, 106 (50.5%) children out of the 210 screened were found to be underweight. Enhanced awareness sessions in the community could contribute to a deeper understanding of these health issues, potentially reducing the prevalence of 2Ds and adolescent health issues and moving toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) faster.",
