  "title": "Non-Coding RNAs as Targets of Acute Kidney Injury Therapy: Ready for Primetime?",
  "abstract": "AKI is a common clinical syndrome characterized by its complex pathophysiology and lack of effective therapeutic options, resulting in significantly increased mortality rates and a higher risk of progression to chronic kidney disease. In recent years, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in the onset and progression of AKI, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). A growing body of research indicates that ncRNAs are not only involved in pathological processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress but also serve as promising early diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. This review systematically explores the molecular mechanisms of ncRNAs in AKI, their potential as therapeutic tools, and highlights recent advancements in the field along with the challenges of clinical translation. Ultimately, we assess whether ncRNA-targeted therapies are ready for clinical application in the management of AKI.",
