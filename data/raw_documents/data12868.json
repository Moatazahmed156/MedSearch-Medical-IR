  "title": "Organoids: Key advances, optimization, and technological iterations in their application to neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "abstract": "Organoid technology, as an innovative approach, has shown great potential in disease modeling, target screening, and the development of treatment strategies. However, traditional organoids still have three major limitations in research: the absence of specific cell types, the lack of blood-brain barrier structure, and insufficient reproducibility of experimental results. In recent years, researchers have gradually overcome these limitations by introducing innovative techniques such as advanced culture methods, microfluidic systems, bioprinting, organoid transplantation, and assembloid construction. This progress has facilitated the widespread application of organoids in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. This paper aims to systematically review the technological innovations of organoids in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. By summarizing classical organoid construction strategies and their limitations, it emphasizes the value of organoids in comprehensive applications within neurodegenerative disease research. In this review, we focus on five specific neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia. Research in these diseases demonstrates that organoids improve experimental accessibility and reduce development cycles in disease modeling, target discovery, and therapeutic strategy formation. Using customized equipment and gene editing techniques, these organoids can be tailored to specific needs, providing pathophysiologically relevant disease models and enhancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. Although organoid technology has demonstrated significant advantages in disease research, its potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases has not yet been fully explored, which may become an important direction for future research.",
