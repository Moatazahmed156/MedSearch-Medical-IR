    "abstract": "Physical therapists have been criticized for ignoring patients with acute or chronic chest diseases, or chest surgery, at a time when increasing numbers of patients having chest diseases are challenging the health professions. A questionnaire survey of 63 physical therapy schools was made to explore this problem. Results of the survey showed that a majority of schools did not offer a course in chest physical therapy. A number failed to teach the treatment of each chest disease or allowed too little time for adequate preparation of the student. Suggestions are offered for more adequate preparation of the student. Suggestions are offered for more adequate treatment of these patients and greater involvement of the physical therapist on the chest team.",
