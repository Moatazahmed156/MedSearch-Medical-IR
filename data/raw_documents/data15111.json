  "abstract": "Most patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exhibit mild symptoms; however, without timely intervention, the condition may progress to cirrhosis or even liver cancer. The development of internet-based proactive follow-up management models has provided new avenues for medical services, allowing patients to access online consultations and enabling doctors to efficiently manage patient information. These models have particular significance for NAFLD patients, as they can enhance compliance and facilitate timely intervention. To explore the effect of an internet-based proactive follow-up management model on the prognosis management of patients with NAFLD. This study collected data from 145 patients diagnosed with NAFLD. The patients were randomly divided into the internet-based proactive follow-up group (71 patients) and the traditional follow-up group (74 patients). The traditional follow-up group underwent routine outpatient and telephone follow-up, while the internet-based proactive follow-up group used the WeChat applet for active reminding, health education and follow-up. During the follow-up period, patients' compliance, disease control status, and quality of life score were recorded. The follow-up compliance of patients in the internet-based proactive follow-up group was significantly higher than that in the traditional follow-up group (85.6%  The internet-based proactive follow-up management model can provide personalized health management plans and reduce the risk of disease deterioration, making it worthy of promotion in a broader healthcare context.",
