    "abstract": "The population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) now exceeds the population of children with CHD. The long-term management of these patients relies on sequential assessment of anatomy and physiology and integration with symptoms, all targeted toward decision making around intervention. The advances in technology have vastly improved our assessment of anatomy and function. However, while the assessment of chronic heart failure in acquired heart disease has been revolutionized by the proven utility of cardiac biomarkers, their use in adult CHD is still being assessed.",
