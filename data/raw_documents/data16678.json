  "title": "Selective Head Cooling and NOX Inhibition Protect the Blood-Brain Barrier in Neonatal Epilepsy.",
  "abstract": "Epileptic seizures in the neonatal brain induce oxidative stress and disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to long-term cerebrovascular and neurodevelopmental deficits. This study examined the protective effects of selective head cooling and NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibition on BBB integrity following seizures. Neonatal seizures were induced in newborn pigs with bicuculline under normothermic or selective head cooling conditions. BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue extravasation and quantification of circulating brain-derived endothelial cells (CD45",
