    "abstract": "There is limited literature to guide shoulder surgeons in the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We aim to help clinicians to formulate an approach to the surgical management of the condition through a review of the available literature on arthroplasty in JIA, general considerations when operating on patients with inflammatory arthropathy and recommendations based on the authors' experience. Four articles report formal data on arthroplasty in JIA with favourable improvements in post-operative pain and function scores after the long-term follow-up. Significant heterogeneity in treatment and a lack of standardisation in quantitative outcomes highlights the need for further larger scale and higher quality research. The aim of this study is to review the evidence and provide information on preoperative evaluation of surgical candidates, operative techniques, choice of implant design and to evaluate functional outcomes in patients who undergo shoulder arthroplasty.",
