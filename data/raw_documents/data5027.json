    "abstract": "Building on decades of research, the past few years have yielded a near expo-nential increase in treatment modalities for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Individually, these improvements in overall survival may appear modest, however, nearly all of them have a distinct mechanism of action and the possibility of synergistic effects have yet to be established. The promise of a durable impact on the mortality from metastatic prostate cancer will likely stem from further elucidation of molecular pathways involved in prostate cancer, as well as defining the optimal sequence of treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.",
