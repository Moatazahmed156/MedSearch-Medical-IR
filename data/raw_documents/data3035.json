    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is the most frequent syndromic form of monogenic diabetes coexisting with optic atrophy and many other disorders. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Wolfram syndrome among children with diabetes in Poland.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      These calculations were performed among Polish diabetic children, aged 0-18 years, from three administrative regions between January 2005 and December 2011. Epidemiological data was obtained by matching the results from the EURO-WABBPoland Project and the PolPeDiab Registry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Throughout the study period, we confirmed genetic diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome in 13 patients from Poland. Three patients originated from the studied regions with complete epidemiological data on paediatric diabetes. The total number of patients with diagnosed diabetes in the study equalled 2,568 cases. The prevalence of Wolfram syndrome among Polish children with diabetes is 0.12% (95% Confidence Interval 0.04-0.34%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We estimate that Wolfram syndrome is: 26 to 35 times less frequent than monogenic diabetes (MODY and neonatal diabetes) in the Polish paediatric population.",
