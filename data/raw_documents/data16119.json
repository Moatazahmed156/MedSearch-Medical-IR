  "title": "Two Cases of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Associated With COVID-19 Infection Yielding Favorable Functional Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening cerebrovascular disorder characterized by high mortality and unfavorable long-term outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with systemic inflammation and coagulopathy, which may result in cerebrovascular complications such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19-associated SAH remain unclear, and favorable outcomes are rarely reported. We encountered two male patients with COVID-19-associated SAH, one with a non-aneurysmal SAH and another with a ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm, both of whom achieved favorable recovery following appropriate management. These cases suggest that early diagnosis, prevention of rebleeding, and timely standard treatment can lead to good outcomes even in COVID-19-associated SAH.",
