  "abstract": "To highlight data on interventions aimed at enhancing referral patterns from primary care to nephrology. Systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO. Studies reporting interventions aimed at decreasing referral volume, reducing wait times and/or increasing guideline-concordant referrals in adult patients with chronic kidney disease from primary care to specialist kidney care, from inception to 15 April 2024. Studies were subcategorised based on taxonomy of initiatives, type of intervention and single versus multi-faceted interventions. Our primary outcomes were changes to referral volume, wait times and proportion of guideline-concordant referrals. Data were pooled using a random effects model and a meta-analysis was conducted using pooled mean difference (MD) and OR. 20 studies used single and 13 used more than one intervention. Overall, interventions resulted in an increase in total referrals (MD: 19 referrals per month, 95% CI 7 to 30; I Organisational changes decreased wait times. Overall, interventions increased referral volume and decreased guideline-concordant referrals. The data have implications for designing programmes to improve primary care-nephrology interface in kidney disease management.",
