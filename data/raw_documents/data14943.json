  "title": "Hydrophilic and lipophilic colchicinoid formulations for therapy of liver fibrosis in murine model.",
  "abstract": "Liver fibrosis (LF) is a chronic disease, induced by various toxic stress factors associated with the regeneration processes and triggering scar tissue formation. Progression of LF usually results in chronic inflammation, fatal liver cirrhosis, and/or the development of hepatic cancer. Herein, we describe the evaluation of the anti-fibrotic effects of novel colchicine derivatives, namely, a water-soluble colchicinoid (4) and a retinoid acid-colchicine conjugate (5) in its liposomal formulation (L2) to target hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The model LF was induced in mice by i.p. injections of CCl",
