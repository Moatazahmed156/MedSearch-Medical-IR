  "title": "Cell-based immunotherapy for neurodegenerative disease: A promising avenue.",
  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and chronic neuroinflammation, with current treatments remaining largely symptomatic. This review explores the potential of cell-based immunotherapy as a disease-modifying strategy. Advances in stem cell biology and immune engineering have facilitated the development of therapies using mesenchymal stem cells, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, macrophages, regulatory T cells, modified macrophages, and monoclonal antibodies. These approaches aim to regulate immune mechanisms implicated in neurodegeneration, such as microglial activation, systemic inflammation, and immune checkpoint dysregulation. Notably, macrophage-mediated delivery systems, such as genetically modified cells expressing neurotrophic factors or antioxidant enzymes, have demonstrated neuroprotective effects. Likewise, emerging data support T-cell modulation and monoclonal antibody development as therapeutic targets in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We highlight current preclinical findings, underlying mechanisms, and translational challenges, emphasizing that immunomodulatory cell therapies represent a promising avenue for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.",
