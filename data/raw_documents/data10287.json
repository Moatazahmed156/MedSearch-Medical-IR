  "title": "The pan-immune-inflammation value associated with in-hospital heart failure in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction.",
  "abstract": "Few studies have focused on the association between pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) and in-hospital heart failure postcoronary angioplasty in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This prospective study aimed to confirm the relationship between PIV, the severity of coronary artery disease, and in-hospital heart failure in elderly patients with AMI after coronary angioplasty. A total of 799 patients with AMI aged greater than or equal to 60 years were enrolled and divided into two groups according to whether they presented heart failure during hospitalization. They all received coronary angiography and underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention. The degree of stenosis of the coronary artery was assessed with the Gensini score. PIV was significantly greater in the heart failure group than in the control group (1250 ± 975 vs. 674 ± 406; P < 0.001). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analyses found that PIV (hazard ratio: 1.029, 95% confidence interval: 1.015-1.045, P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor of in-hospital heart failure. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the optimal cutoff value of the PIV for pridicting in- hospital heart failure was 693, with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 69%. In addition, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PIV was an independent predictor of the severity of coronary artery disease (P < 0.05). PIV was an independent predictor of the severity of coronary artery disease and in-hospital heart failure in elderly patients with AMI after coronary angioplasty.",
