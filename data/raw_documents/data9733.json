  "title": "Serum Galectin-3 as a Prognostic Biomarker in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with a particularly high burden in low- and middle-income countries such as Nigeria. Early identification of biomarkers, such as serum Galectin-3, which plays a role in inflammation and tissue remodeling, may improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. This study aimed to compare serum Galectin-3 levels between patients with acute ischemic stroke and age- and sex-matched stroke-free controls. A prospective comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. A total of 100 first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients and 100 apparently healthy controls were recruited. Serum Galectin-3 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed to compare Galectin-3 levels between groups using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 24.0. The median serum Galectin-3 level was significantly higher in stroke patients compared to controls [60 (55.00-63.00) vs 56 (49.00-62.00), p = 0.003]. The two groups were comparable in age and sex distribution, but hypertension and diabetes were significantly more prevalent among stroke patients. Elevated serum Galectin-3 levels were positively associated with stroke diagnosis. Serum Galectin-3 is significantly elevated in acute ischemic stroke patients compared to stroke-free individuals. Galectin-3 could serve as an important biomarker for acute ischemic stroke, aiding in timely diagnosis and management.",
