  "title": "Blue LED photobiomodulation in the prevention of radiodermatitis in breast cancer survivors: a clinical trial.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study is to investigate the photobiomodulation (PBM) effects when applying blue LED on the grade and severity of radiodermatitis (RD) and analyze the dermatological quality of life of female breast cancer survivors. This is a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial, with 53 women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Participants were divided into a control group (CG; n = 27) and an intervention group (IG; n = 26). The intervention consisted of PBM with blue LED (470 nm) before each RT session, with an energy density of 18.6 J/cm The RD occurrence was 28% lower (p = 0.039) in the intervention group (n = 11) compared to the CG (n = 19). Dermatological quality of life presents a moderate reduction over time only in the patients in the CG (p = 0.005). This worsening is attributed to increases in the DLQI scores for symptoms and feelings (p = 0.003), daily activities (p = 0.003), and treatment (p = 0.005). The findings suggest that blue LED may be a promising resource to improve the quality of life of patients undergoing RT. Blue LED may be a sound therapeutic strategy in radiodermatitis management, minimizing radiotherapy negative impacts, consequently improving the quality of life.",
