  "title": "Integrative Analysis of miR-21, PTEN, and Immune Signatures in Colorectal Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy, its clinical benefit in CRC is often limited by an immune-excluded tumor microenvironment (TME). MicroRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) is a well-established oncomiR in CRC; however, its role in immune resistance remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we explored the potential immunoregulatory role of miR-21-5p in CRC by integrating transcriptomic profiling of TCGA-COAD and TCGA-READ cohorts with experimental validation of its target PTEN in CRC cell models. MiR-21-5p was markedly upregulated in tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues and was associated with reduced infiltration of CD8",
