    "abstract": "Stem cells have currently gained attention in the field of medicine not only due to their ability to repair dysfunctional or damaged cells, but also they could be used as drug delivery system after being engineered to do so. Human umbilical cord is attractive source for autologous and allogenic stem cells that are currently amenable to treatment of various diseases. Human umbilical cord stem cells are -in contrast to embryonic and fetal stem cells- ethically noncontroversial, inexpensive and readily available source of cells. Umbilical cord, umbilical cord vein, amnion/placenta and Wharton's jelly are all rich of many types of multipotent stem cell populations capable of forming many different cell types. This review will focus on umbilical cord stem cells processing and current application in medicine.",
