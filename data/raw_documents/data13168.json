  "abstract": "With the availability of monoclonal anti-body treatment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a need to screen and identify emergent disease as soon as possible. In a companion abstract, a panel of six novel outcome measures from the digital Trail Making Test-Part B (dTMT-B) was able to dissociate patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus normal cognition (NC). The current research fashioned an abbreviated dTMT-B test and assessed how well this test can dissociate patients with MCI versus NC; and relationships between paper/pencil neuropsychological tests. Using a digital neuropsychological battery of episodic and working memory tests, memory clinic patients (n = 58) were classified into groups presenting with MCI versus NC. An abbreviated dTMT-B test was created by examining behavior confined to approximately the first half of the test, i.e., target circle '1' through target circle 'F'. The panel of dTMT-B process metrics included (1) hit duration or time spent with the pen inside target circles; (2) distance or the length of an imaginary line connecting all targets; and (3) the velocity or the speed pen strokes were drawn. MCI patients were slightly older and less educated than NC patients; and scored lower on the MMSE. An ANOVA controlled for age, education, and sex found longer hit duration for MCI compared to NC patients (p < 0.004, η The engineering of the Trail Making Test- Part B onto the digital platform has resulted in a panel of new process-based metrics and potentially increases the versatility of this test. An abbreviated version of the test could easily be deployed to screen for emergent cognitive impairment.",
