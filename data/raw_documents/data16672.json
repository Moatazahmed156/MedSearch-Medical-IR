  "abstract": "Epileptic seizure (ES) detection is critical for improving clinical outcomes in epilepsy management. While intracranial EEG (iEEG) provides high-quality neural recordings, existing detection methods often rely on large amounts of data, involve high computational complexity, or fail to generalize in low-data settings. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, data-efficient, and high-performance approach for ES detection based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). Our method first extracts local binary patterns (LBPs) from each iEEG channel to capture temporal-spatial dynamics. These binary sequences are then mapped into a high-dimensional space via HDC for robust representation, followed by a binary Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish ictal and inter-ictal states. The proposed design enables fast inference, low memory requirements, and suitability for hardware implementation. We evaluate the method on the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG short-term dataset. In one-shot learning, it achieves 100% sensitivity and specificity for most patients. In few-shot learning, it maintains 98.88% sensitivity and 93.09% specificity on average. The average latency is 4.31 s, demonstrating that it is much better than state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the method's potential for efficient, low-resource, and high-performance ES detection.",
