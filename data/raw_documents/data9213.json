    "abstract": "Stem cell-based therapy is known as a regenerative approach for a variety of diseases and tissue injuries. These cells exert their therapeutic effects through paracrine secretions namely extracellular vesicles. To achieve higher therapeutic potential, a variety of delivery routes have been tested in clinical and preclinical studies. Direct cell injection, intra-venous administration, and intra-arterial infusion are widely used methods of stem cells delivery but these methods are associated with several complications. As one of the most popular biological delivery systems, amniotic membrane has been widely utilized to support cell proliferation and differentiation therefore facilitating tissue regeneration without endangering the stem cells' viability. It is composed of several extracellular matrix components and growth factors. Due to these characteristics, amniotic membrane can mimic the stem cell's niche and can be an ideal carrier for stem cell transplantation. Here, we provide an overview of the recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives in the use of amniotic membrane as a delivery platform for stem cells.",
