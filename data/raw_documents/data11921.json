  "title": "LDH-driven lactic acidosis in hypoxic solid tumors: Mechanisms of metastatic transformation and therapeutic opportunities.",
  "abstract": "Lactic acidosis is a characteristic feature of solid hypoxic cancerous tumors, those that develop in the breast, colon, and prostate tissue. Even though extreme lactic acidosis is damaging to healthy cells, malignant tumors actually benefit from it in several different ways. Lactic acidosis in TME (TME) imparts resistance to chemotherapy and helps them from immune invasion. Lactic acidosis further benefits the tumor cells by inducing the formation of new blood vessels. Acidic tumour microenvironment (TME) provides very favourable pH conditions for activation of proteolytic enzymes like Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2/9), which helps the tumor cells invade into the nearby organs. Because aggressive hypoxic cancer cells have a high chance of metastasising to other organs, it is difficult to manage a tumor at this stage with chemotherapy. Stopping hypoxia-induced Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from working can prevent cancers from behaving aggressively. Restraining lactate circulation in the TME by inhibiting LDH and its transporters i.e Monocarboxylate transporters (MCT-1/2) would be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent metastatic transformation of solid hypoxic tumors. Moreover, nanotechnology can be implicated in various ways to selectively kill the cancer cells. Whereas in some cancers, chemotherapeutic agents fail to activate, pH-sensitive nanoparticles can be designed to target such cancer cells. In the current review, we have highlighted the role and mechanisms of lactic acidosis to transform the benign tumours into more aggressive metastatic tumors. This review also offers fresh perspectives on the variety of LDH and MCT inhibitors currently undergoing clinical trials to act in the acidic TME.",
