  "abstract": "Environmental exposures such as silica dust, microplastics, and general dust have significant health impacts. We performed a PubMed-based analysis (2000-2025) of research trends on these exposures, associated diseases, and experimental models. Pulmonary fibrosis was the most studied disease, while animal models and conventional  We performed a PubMed search (2000-2025) to quantify publications on occupational exposures (silica, coal dust, microplastics, dust), related diseases [asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, cardiovascular disease], and experimental models (transwell, organ-on-a-chip,  Annual publication trends for silica dust, microplastic, dust, and coal dust showed an overall increase from 2000 to 2025, with silica dust and dust exhibiting steady growth and microplastic-related publications rising sharply after 2016. Total publications were highest for silica dust and dust, while coal dust and microplastic were less studied. Exposure-disease analysis revealed pulmonary fibrosis as the primary outcome associated with silica dust (619 publications) and dust (373), whereas asthma and COPD were less frequently studied; microplastic and coal dust publications were comparatively few. Experimental model usage indicated a clear predominance of animal models and  The observed trends reflect increasing research focus on occupational and environmental exposures, particularly for silica dust and microplastics, with pulmonary fibrosis as the most frequently studied disease outcome. The predominant use on animal and conventional ",
