    "abstract": "The human endometrium, a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical shedding, repair, regeneration, and remodeling, relies on progenitor stem cells for replenishment. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) also may play a crucial role in the physiological process of endometrial regeneration, augmenting endometrial repair, supporting pregnancy, and thereby making a major contribution to reproduction. Notably, defective or inappropriate recruitment and engraftment of stem cells are implicated in various reproductive diseases, including endometriosis, highlighting the potential therapeutic avenues offered by stem cell-targeted interventions. Endometrial progenitor cells have shown promise in improving pregnancy outcomes and addressing infertility issues. Furthermore, BM-MSCs demonstrate the potential to reverse pathologies, including Asherman's syndrome and thin endometrium, offering novel approaches to treating infertility, implantation failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Mobilization of endogenous stem cells to areas of pathology through chemoattractants also presents a promising strategy for targeted therapy. Finally, endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells, characterized by their multipotent nature and ease of collection through minimally invasive techniques, hold promise in a wide range of reproductive and non-reproductive pathologies, including diabetes, kidney disease, Parkinson's disease, or cardiac disorders. As the best of our knowledge of stem cell biology continues to grow, the incorporation of stem cell-based therapies into clinical practice presents significant potential to transform reproductive medicine and enhance patient outcomes.",
