    "abstract": "Surgical resection of head and neck cancer results in predictable patterns of dysphagia and aspiration due to disruption of the anatomic structures of swallowing. Common procedures undertaken in the treatment of head and neck cancer include tracheostomy, glossectomy, mandibulectomy, surgery on the palate, total and partial laryngectomy, reconstruction of the pharynx and cervical esophagus, and surgery of the skull base. An overview is presented of normal swallowing physiology, as well as swallowing perturbations that are frequently encountered in postoperative head and neck cancer patients.",
