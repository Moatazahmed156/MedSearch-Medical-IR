  "title": "Attitudes towards opportunistic salpingectomy among patients planned to undergo non-gynecologic intra-abdominal surgery.",
  "abstract": "To evaluate the knowledge of and interest in opportunistic salpingectomy (OS) in patients undergoing non-gynecologic abdominal surgery. English-speaking patients aged 18 or older with fallopian tubes who were scheduled for upcoming abdominal general, colorectal, or bariatric surgery were approached. A phone-administered questionnaire was used to collect demographics, clinical history, knowledge of OS, and likelihood to undergo OS if offered. Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, and odds ratios were calculated in R. 153 patients were contacted, of which 68 were eligible and agreed to participate (44.4 % response rate). Of the 68 participants, 60 (88.2 %) were considered OS candidates (not interested in future fertility). The average age was 58, and 97 % of respondents self-identified as White. Forty-five respondents (75.0 %) were post-menopausal, 11 (18.3 %) had undergone a hysterectomy, and 16 (26.7 %) had undergone permanent contraception. Only 12 (20.0 %) knew OS reduces ovarian cancer risk. Among OS candidates, 15 (25.0 %) were likely to undergo OS during their upcoming surgery if offered. Predictors of likelihood to undergo OS during surgery include awareness of OS (50.0 % vs 19.0 %, OR 4.33, 95 % CI: 1.13-16.61, p = 0.025), family history of ovarian cancer (66.7 % vs 20.4 %, OR 7.82, 95 % CI: 1.26-48.35, p = 0.030), and interest in permanent contraception (100 % vs 25 %, p = 0.044). Among patients with fallopian tubes undergoing non-gynecologic abdominal surgery, most were appropriate candidates for OS. Prior awareness of OS, family history of ovarian cancer, and interest in permanent contraception were associated with a greater interest in OS.",
