    "abstract": "Background: The minimum number of lymph nodes that should be evaluated in colon cancer to adequately categorize lymph node status is still controversial. The lymph node ratio (LNR) may be a better prognostic indicator. Materials & methods: We studied 1065 patients treated from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2012. Results: Significant differences in survival were detected according to regional lymph nodes (pN) (p < 0.001) and LNR (p < 0.001). LRN and pN are independent prognostic factors. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between the total number of dissected lymph nodes and pN (rs = 0.167; p < 0.001), but the total number of dissected lymph nodes is not significantly correlated with LNR (rs = -0.019; p = 0.550). Interpretation: In this study, LNR seems to demonstrate a superior prognostic value compared with the pN categories, in part due to its greater independence regarding the extent of lymphadenectomy.",
