  "title": "Seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage among immunocompromised adults in France: A need for improvement.",
  "abstract": "To estimate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage in immunocompromised adults in France. We used the Echantillon Généraliste des Bénéficiaires database, a representative sample of 850,000 patients covered by health insurance, with prospective collection of data on health care. We included adult patients with at least one of the following conditions: people living with HIV (PLWH), solid organ transplant, cancer treated by chemotherapy, any patient under immunosuppressive/immunomodulating therapy. We enrolled 10,784 immunocompromised patients, with a median age of 49 years [35-63]. During 2011-2017, complete seasonal influenza vaccine coverage (i.e., one shot each year) was 14.3 % [13.6-15.0] and closely correlated with age: 1.2 %, 2.8 %, 10.9 %, and 38.7 %, in the age groups 18-34, 35-49, 50-65, and > 65 years, respectively (P < 0.01). Pneumococcal vaccine coverage was complete (13-valent conjugated vaccine followed by 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine) in 6.9 %, not correlated with age. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine coverage in France during the study period, was very low, complete in < 15 % of immunocompromised adults.",
