    "abstract": "Two patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes insipidus (DI), optic atrophy (OA), deafness (D) and dilatation of the urinary tract-the so-called DIDMOAD syndrome are presented. In one of the patients, the presenting components were DI and OA. In the second case, DM was the first manifestation to be diagnosed, and in this patient the course of the syndrome was complicated by associated epileptical activity disorders, and later septicemia. The admission of these patients led us to review the literature describing this syndrome.",
