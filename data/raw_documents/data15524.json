  "title": "The role of chest X-ray in tuberculosis detection for high school students in China: a cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "In China, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) screening for children and adolescents is not only focused on family contacts, but also students in high schools. The research objective is to investigate chest X-ray (CXR) abnormalities and its risk factors. From January 2022 to December 2022, PTB screening was conducted among 24,577 Senior 1 and Senior 2 students in Chongqing using the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and CXR. The detection rate for suspected PTB through CXR was 0.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.3%-0.8%), and the detection rate for PTB through CXR was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%). Participants in Southeast Districts were more likely to develop PTB (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR], 9.6; 95% CI, 1.3-70.4). CXR has played a significant role in PTB screening in high schools in the Chongqing. It is necessary to strengthen policy support for the Southeast Districts in Chongqing.",
