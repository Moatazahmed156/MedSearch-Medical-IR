    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) may be a presenting manifestation of a few endocrine disorders and should be considered in evaluation of heart failure causes. This clinically oriented review is an attempt to highlight the protean manifestations of heart failure in endocrine diseases which could present either as acute or chronic heart failure. Acute heart failure manifests as hypertensive crisis, Takotsubo syndrome, or as tachy/brady cardiomyopathies. Chronic heart failure could masquerade with features of hyperdynamic heart failure, or hypertrophic, restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy. Rarely constrictive features or resistant heart failure could be the presenting feature. Isolated presentation as pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure are also documented. Good history-taking and physical examination with targeted investigations will help in the timely management for reversing the pathophysiology to a significant extent by appropriated management.",
