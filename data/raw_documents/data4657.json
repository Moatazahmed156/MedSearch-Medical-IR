    "abstract": "Several dozen lung epithelial cell lines have been established in culture over the past 20 years from normal lung explants and their spontaneous transformants, and from lung tumors that arose spontaneously or were induced with chemicals, viruses, or oncogenic transgenes. To provide information from which to choose appropriate lines for investigating problems in lung cell biology and pulmonary neoplasia, this review describes the origins of these lines and some of their characteristics. These include growth, morphology, tumorigenicity, ability to metastasize, xenobiotic metabolism, mutational status, signal transducing activities, cytogenetics, ability to form domes, and electric conductance. In addition to collecting this information in a single place for the first time, we describe previously unpublished apoptosis features of some of these lines. An increasing number of investigations are beginning to use these lines and this review contains references into 1997.",
