    "abstract": "This article provides a substantive review and synthesis of major areas of emphasis in spinal cord injury (SCI) research. Comprehensive examination of the current status and future implications for SCI research includes consideration of investigations from the following arenas: epidemiology, functional classification and prediction, neurophysiologic testing, models of injury and recovery, psychosocial considerations, surgical strategies, animal laboratory research, economic implications, life expectancy, complication rates, gender differences, pharmacological management, and prevention. Synthesis of these research conclusions from a broad spectrum of laboratory, clinical, and scientific domains provides opportunity for improving SCI prevention, treatment, and adaptation.",
