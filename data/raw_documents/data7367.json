    "abstract": "Adult stem cells have been developed as therapeutics for tissue regeneration and immune regulation due to their self-renewing, differentiating, and paracrine functions. Recently, a variety of adult stem cells from the oral cavity have been discovered, and these dental stem cells mostly exhibit the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Dental MSCs can be applied for the replacement of dental and oral tissues against various tissue-damaging conditions including dental caries, periodontitis, and oral cancers, as well as for systemic regulation of excessive inflammation in immune disorders, such as autoimmune diseases and hypersensitivity. Therefore, in this review, we summarized and updated the types of dental stem cells and their functions to exert therapeutic efficacy against diseases.",
