  "abstract": "Liver fibrosis has the potential to advance to irreversible cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, rendering early diagnosis and intervention of utmost importance. During liver fibrogenesis, lysyl oxidase enzymes become upregulated, which facilitate ε amino groups of lysine in extracellular matrix proteins to become oxidized, yielding the aldehyde-containing allysine (Lys",
