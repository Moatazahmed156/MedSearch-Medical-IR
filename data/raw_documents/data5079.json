    "abstract": "The commitment to specific T lymphocytes (T cell) lineages is governed by distinct transcription factors, whose expression is modulated through epigenetic mechanisms. Unravelling these epigenetic mechanisms that regulate T cell differentiation and function holds significant importance for understanding T cells. Menin, a multifunctional scaffolding protein, is implicated in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell cycle control, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, primarily through epigenetic mechanisms. Existing research indicates Menin's impact on T cell differentiation and function, while a comprehensive and systematic review is currently lacking to consolidate these findings. In the current review, we have highlighted recent studies on the role of Menin in T cell differentiation and function, focusing mainly on its impact on the memory Th2 maintenance, Th17 differentiation and maintenance, CD4+ T cell senescence, and effector CD8+ T cell survival. Considering Menin's crucial function in maintaining effector T cell function, the potential of inhibiting Menin activity in mitigating inflammatory diseases associated with excessive T cell activation has also been emphasised.",
