  "title": "Immunological Monitoring During Anti-CD20 Therapies to Predict Infection Risk and Treatment Response in Multiple Sclerosis Patients.",
  "abstract": "Immunological monitoring in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with disease-modifying drugs may help predict infectious complications and guide treatment. The main objective of this study was to evaluate whether anti-CD20 treatments in MS patients induce immunodeficiency and whether certain immunological parameters can predict the risk of infection and response to treatment. This retrospective, observational, single-centre study included MS patients who started treatment with ocrelizumab or rituximab and received follow-up in the Neuroimmunology Unit of our centre between January 2017 and January 2023. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Immunology Department of this hospital. Fifty-five patients were included, with a mean age of 47 years and a follow-up period of 24 months. Analyses of lymphocyte subpopulations (T, B, NK) and immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) were performed before treatment and at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-ups. In addition, we carried out an exhaustive study of B cells in the baseline analysis. Sixty-four percent of patients presented infections, mostly due to COVID-19. Three patients developed cryptogenic organising pneumonia. IgG hypogammaglobulinemia was the main risk factor for developing infections. Patients with infections had fewer mature memory B cells and a lower percentage of NK cells. Furthermore, a lower proportion of naïve and mature memory B cells was associated with inflammatory activity and disease progression, respectively. The absence of CD20 depletion during follow-up was associated with clinical worsening. Baseline immunophenotype and immunological monitoring can help predict the risk of infections and the efficacy of anti-CD20 therapy in MS patients.",
