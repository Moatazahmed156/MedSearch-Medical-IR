    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although the Pilates method has been reported to be effective in women with low back pain (LBP), the efficacy of Pilates exercises in pregnant women with LBP has not been evaluated widely.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of clinical Pilates exercises on lumbopelvic stabilization, pain, disability and quality of life in pregnant women with LBP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fourty pregnant women were randomized into either a Pilates exercise group (n= 20) or control group (n= 20). Subjects in the Pilates exercise group performed the exercises two times a week for eight weeks. Subjects in the control group followed regular prenatal care. Lumbopelvic stabilization was assessed with a pressure biofeedback unit, pain with the Visual Analog Scale, disability with the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire and quality of life with the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pain and disability were significantly improved in the Pilates exercise group after intervention (p= 0.03, p< 0.001, respectively). There were also significant improvements in sleep, physical mobility sub-parameters of NHP and lumbopelvic stabilization after Pilates exercises (p= 0.048, p= 0.007, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant changes in all outcome measures in the control group (p> 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pilates exercises can be recommended as an effective and safe method for increasing lumbopelvic stabilization, reducing pain and disability, improving physical mobility and sleep problems in pregnant women with LBP.",
