  "title": "Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Undergoing Total Ankle Arthroplasty Have Shorter Operative Time and Longer Hospital Length of Stay.",
  "abstract": "There is a dearth of studies analyzing outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) receiving total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The present study aimed to compare preoperative characteristics and 30-day postoperative outcomes for patients with COPD undergoing TAA. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for primary TAA (CPT: 27702) from 2012 - 2020. Baseline comorbidities were compared using univariable statistics and subsequently multivariable regression was performed to measure the effect of COPD on operative time, LOS, and 30-day readmissions after TAA. In a sample of 1,619 total patients, on multivariate regression, COPD was found to be an independent risk factor predictor for shorter operative time ( b = -0.33; p = 0.037), and hospital LOS (b = 0.37; p = 0.039). In conclusion, it was determined that COPD is an independent risk factor for shorter operative time and increased duration of hospital length of stay in patients undergoing TAA. Clinical level of evidence: Level III. (Journal of Surgical Orthopaedic Advances 34(4):174-177, 2025).",
