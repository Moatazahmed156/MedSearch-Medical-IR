    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Nicorandil is a potassium-channel activator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. The first cases of anal ulcerations induced by nicorandil were published in 2002.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      A 71-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of anal ulcerations occurring within a few months of initiation of treatment with Nicorandil. Histological tests on a biopsy sample showed granulation tissue with non-specific chronic inflammation. Nicorandil was stopped and this resulted in complete healing of the ulcers after three months.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Nicorandil can induce chronic and extensive anal ulcerations. The pathogenesis is unknown. Patients are usually treated with high doses of nicorandil. Dermatologists should be aware of this rare side-effect which heals after withdrawal of the drug.",
