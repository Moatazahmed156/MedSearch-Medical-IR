  "title": "Lebrikizumab is Efficacious in Adults and Adolescents with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis Regardless of Atopic Comorbidities.",
  "abstract": "Atopic comorbidities are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and increase disease burden. Lebrikizumab monotherapy demonstrated efficacy and safety through 52 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe AD in phase 3 trials (ADvocate1 [NCT04146363]; ADvocate2 [NCT04178967]). To evaluate the impact of atopic comorbidities on lebrikizumab efficacy and response maintenance in patients with AD using pooled data from ADvocate1 and ADvocate2. At the end of the 16-week induction period, patients responding to lebrikizumab treatment every 2 weeks (Q2W) were re-randomized to receive lebrikizumab Q2W, every 4 weeks (Q4W), or placebo (withdrawal) for 36 additional weeks. Eczema Area and Severity Index ≥75% or ≥90% improvement (EASI 75; EASI 90), Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ≥4-point improvement, Investigator's Global Assessment 0 or 1 (IGA 0/1), and Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) results were assessed at Weeks 16 and 52. Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) and sleep-loss due to pruritus were assessed at Week 16. Of 851 patients, 614 (72.2%) reported ≥1 atopic comorbidity. At Week 16, significantly more lebrikizumab- versus placebo-treated patients achieved EASI 75, Pruritus NRS ≥4-point improvement, IGA 0/1, and EASI 90 (p<0.001), regardless of atopic comorbidities. Results were similar for DLQI and sleep-loss. Most lebrikizumab responders at Week 16, both with and without atopic comorbidities, maintained skin and pruritus response through Week 52; ACQ-5 scores remained stable. The presence or absence of atopic comorbidities did not impact the efficacy of lebrikizumab at Weeks 16 and 52 in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.",
