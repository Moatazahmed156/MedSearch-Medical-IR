    "abstract": "The treatment of acute myocardial infarction continues to change rapidly. The mortality of many subgroups of patients sustaining acute myocardial infarction has significantly decreased. Current therapeutic modalities provide the physician with many agents that favorably influence the course of acute myocardial infarction. Improving diagnostic techniques provide the physician with the means to identify subsets of patients who are at very low risk or very high risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and to improve the management of these subsets.",
