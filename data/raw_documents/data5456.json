    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. The majority of gastric cancers are sporadic but familial clustering is seen in more than 10% of cases. This manuscript is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to the non-syndromic hereditary gastric cancer, particularly the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and other gastric polyposes including the recently described GAPPS (Gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach). The second part concerns the syndromic gastric cancer, namely the HNPCC syndrome (Hereditary Non Polyposis Colorectal Cancer) occurring as part of a genetic predisposition syndrome to cancer. Recent advances in oncogenetics and next generation sequencing technology have enabled the identification of new entities. This enhancement in knowledge regarding inherited syndromes predisposing to gastric cancer has consequently improved the management of patients and their families. In this context, pathologists play a major role in identifying particular morphologic entities prompting genetic investigation. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an update on the current knowledge about hereditary gastric cancer.",
