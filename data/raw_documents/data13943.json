  "title": "Impact of disease activity on the long-term progression of wrist joint deterioration over 10 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",
  "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between wrist deterioration and each of disease activity and physical function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We analyzed 434 wrists in patients with RA who initiated treatment within the first year of disease onset. The annual mean Disease Activity Score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), the annual mean Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and the biennial decrease in the carpo: metacarpal ratio (c/MC) on plain radiographs were assessed. At year 10, wrists were classified into three groups according to Larsen grade (LG): LG 0, LG I-II, and LG ≥ III. In LG ≥ III, the annual mean DAS28-ESR at year 1 was particularly high, and both the annual mean HAQ-DI and the decrease in c/MC remained the highest throughout the study. The decrease in c/MC for 10 years had a weak positive correlation with the annual mean DAS28-ESR for 10 years (r=0.301, p<0.001). The mean DAS28-ESR cut-off value indicating progression to LG ≥ III at year 10 was 3.59 during the first two years. Control of disease activity in the early stage is crucial to prevent wrist joint deterioration and preserve physical function in patients with RA.",
