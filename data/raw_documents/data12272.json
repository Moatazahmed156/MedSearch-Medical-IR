  "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation for Stage 1a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in medically inoperable patients. This retrospective study analyzed 176 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous cryoablation for biopsy-proven stage 1a NSCLC at a single institution between July 2020 and July 2025. Inclusion criteria included tumor size ≤3 cm, medically inoperable disease or patient refusal of surgery, and ECOG performance status <2. Procedures were performed under computed tomography guidance with a standardized triple freeze-thaw protocol. Follow-up involved routine CT and PET imaging at standardized intervals. Overall and local progression free survival and adverse event rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 170 patients with complete follow-up data, the 1-year and 3-year local progression-free survival rates were 91.8% and 89.4%, respectively, while the overall local progression rate was 10.6%. Overall survival rates were 100.0% at 1 year and 94.7% at 3 years. On multivariate analysis, only larger tumor size (Stage IA3 vs. IA2) was a significant independent predictor of local progression (adjusted HR 4.71, p = .001).Pneumothorax requiring intervention was the most common adverse event (17.6%), with no in-hospital deaths, air embolism, or massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Percutaneous cryoablation provides effective local control with a favorable safety profile in medically inoperable stage 1a NSCLC patients particularly with tumor smaller than 2.0cm. These results support further exploration of cryoablation as a primary treatment modality for this patient population.",
