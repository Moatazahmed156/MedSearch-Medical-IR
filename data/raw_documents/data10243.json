  "title": "Paclitaxel-Coated Balloons versus Drug-Eluting Stents in Small Vessel Coronary Artery Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Drug-eluting stents (DES) remain the standard of care for percutaneous coronary intervention in small vessel coronary artery disease (SVD). Paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB) have emerged as an alternative, with recent trials suggesting favorable short- and mid-term outcomes, although most were limited by small sample sizes. To compare angiographic and clinical outcomes between DES and PCB in patients with SVD. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies comparing PCB and DES in SVD, defined as a reference vessel diameter < 3.0 mm. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and results were reported as mean differences (MD) or risk ratios (RR). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square, Tau, and Tau2 tests. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024506502). A total of 12 studies comprising 17,441 patients (mean age of 58-73 years) were included, with clinical follow-up of 8 to 36 months. All studies evaluated PCB. No significant differences were found between PCB and DES in target lesion revascularization (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.82-1.85; p = 0.30), late lumen loss (MD, -0.09 mm; 95% CI, -0.41 to 0.23; p = 0.57), major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33; p = 0.95), all-cause mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.50-1.31; p = 0.39), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.78-3.89; p = 0.17), and myocardial infarction (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.27; p = 0.30). PCB angioplasty demonstrated clinical and angiographic outcomes comparable to DES in SVD, supporting its role as a safe, effective alternative in selected patients. Os stents farmacológicos (SF) permanecem como padrão terapêutico na intervenção coronariana percutânea em casos de doença arterial coronariana de pequenos vasos (DACPV). Balões revestidos com paclitaxel (BRP) têm surgido como alternativa promissora, com estudos recentes indicando desfechos favoráveis em curto e médio prazos, embora a maioria apresente limitações quanto ao tamanho amostral. Comparar os desfechos clínicos e angiográficos entre SF e BRP em pacientes com DACPV. Foram realizadas buscas nas bases de dados PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library e ClinicalTrials.gov por estudos que comparassem BRP e SF em DACPV, definida como diâmetro de referência do vaso < 3,0 mm. Realizou-se metanálise com modelo de efeitos aleatórios, apresentando os resultados como diferença média (DM) ou razão de risco (RR). A significância estatística foi considerada para p < 0,05. A heterogeneidade foi avaliada por meio dos testes qui-quadrado, Tau e Tau2. O protocolo da revisão foi registrado na PROSPERO (CRD42024506502). Foram incluídos 12 estudos, totalizando 17.441 pacientes (média de idade entre 58 e 73 anos), com follow-up clínico variando entre 8 e 36 meses. Todos os estudos avaliaram BRP. Não foram observadas diferenças significativas entre BRP e SF em relação à revascularização da lesão-alvo (RR, 1,24; IC 95%, 0,82-1,85; p = 0,30), perda tardia de lúmen (DM, –0,09 mm; IC 95%, –0,41 a 0,23; p = 0,57), eventos cardiovasculares adversos maiores (RR, 1,01; IC 95%, 0,76-1,33; p = 0,95), mortalidade por todas as causas (RR, 0,81; IC 95%, 0,50-1,31; p = 0,39), mortalidade cardiovascular (RR, 1,74; IC 95%, 0,78-3,89; p = 0,17) e infarto do miocárdio (RR, 0,76; IC 95%, 0,46-1,27; p = 0,30). A angioplastia com BRP apresentou desfechos clínicos e angiográficos comparáveis aos observados com SF na DACPV, reforçando sua viabilidade como alternativa segura e eficaz em pacientes selecionados.
