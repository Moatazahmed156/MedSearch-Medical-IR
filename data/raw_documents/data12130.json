  "abstract": "Cardiac muscle wasting is a significant complication observed in lung cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Radiotherapy, a commonly used anticancer treatment, is known to cause cardiovascular complications; however, the mechanisms linking tumor irradiation to cardiac wasting remain poorly understood. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and CT26 tumor-bearing mice received localized tumor irradiation. Conditioned medium or EVs from irradiated tumor cells were collected and used to treat HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Autophagy, protein synthesis, and atrophy were assessed. The roles of tumor Thbs1 and cardiac PERK signaling were determined via shRNA-mediated knockdown and PERK mutation in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that localized tumor irradiation induces cardiac muscle wasting in mice, which is associated with PERK-eIF2α-Atf4 pathway activation and increased Thbs1 protein-but not mRNA-levels in cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, Thbs1 is delivered via extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from irradiated tumors. Tumor-derived Thbs1 These results indicate that radiotherapy promotes the release of Thbs1",
