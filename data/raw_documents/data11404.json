  "abstract": "This study mainly aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of 3D-printed orthoses versus low-temperature thermoplastic plate orthoses(LTT)on wrist-hand flexor spasticity post-stroke. Patients were stratified into three cohorts based on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) grades (1,1+, and 2), with 60 patients per cohort. Patients in each cohort were randomized into treatment and control groups: MAS1 (3D,  At 6 weeks, significant difference in the MAS scores were observed between groups: effective rates (ERs) were MAS1:71.4% vs. 30.8%,  3D-printed orthoses demonstrated superior efficacy to LTT orthoses in reducing mild-to-moderate (MAS 1, 1+) wrist-hand flexor spasticity post-stroke. For severe spasticity (MAS 2), further optimization of material properties and scanning technology may be necessary. ChiCTR-INR-2,300,070,454 (Registered: 4 December 2023).
