  "title": "Advancements in Renal Imaging: A Comprehensive Systematic Review of PET Probes for Enhanced GFR and Renal Perfusion Assessment.",
  "abstract": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a key indicator of renal function. Traditional methods for GFR measurement have limitations including invasiveness, low spatial resolution, and lengthy protocols. Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have emerged as promising tools for non-invasive, accurate, and dynamic renal function assessment. ",
