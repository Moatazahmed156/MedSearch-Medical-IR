    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Healthcare workers faced unique challenges during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic which necessitated rapid adaptation. Clinical event debriefings (CEDs) are one tool that teams can use to reflect after events and identify opportunities for improving their performance and their processes. There are few reports of how teams have used CEDs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to explore the issues discussed during COVID-19 CEDs and propose a framework model for qualitatively analyzing CEDs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a descriptive, qualitative study of a hospital-wide CED program at a quaternary children's hospital between March and July 2020. CEDs were in-person, team-led, voluntary, scripted sessions using the Debriefing in Suspected COVID-19 to Encourage Reflection and Team Learning (DISCOVER-TooL). Debriefing content was qualitatively analyzed using constant comparative coding with an integrated deductive and inductive approach. A novel conceptual framework was proposed for understanding how debriefing content can be employed at various levels in a health system for learning and improvement.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-one debriefings were performed and analyzed. Debriefings had a median of 7 debriefing participants, lasted a median of 10 min, and were associated with multiple systems-based process improvements. Fourteen themes and 25 subthemes were identified and categorized into a novel Input-Mediator-Output-Input Debriefing (IMOID) model. The most common themes included communication, coordination, situational awareness, team member roles, and clinical standards.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Teams identified diverse issues in their debriefing discussions related to areas of high performance and opportunities for improvement in their care of COVID-19 patients. This model may help healthcare systems to understand how CED tools can be used to accelerate organizational learning to promote safety and improve outcomes in changing clinical environments.",
