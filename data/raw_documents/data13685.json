  "title": "Transcriptomic Evaluation of Hollow Microneedles-Mediated Drug Delivery for Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy.",
  "abstract": "Microneedle array-based drug delivery offers a minimally invasive and safe approach for breaching the skin barrier, enabling localized and targeted treatment-an advantage particularly valuable in chronic condition management, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA presents a multifaceted pathophysiology, often necessitating long-term pharmacological management. However, conventional oral administration may lead to systemic drug distribution, increasing the likelihood of adverse effects, and ultimately undermining therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a hollow microneedle array was employed for effective delivery of Tofacitinib and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple levels, in which inflammation and cartilage degradation were assessed histologically using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Safranin O-Fast Green staining. Radiologically, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was employed to visualize bone structure alterations. On the molecular level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways were identified through transcriptomic profiling pre- and post-treatment. And the potential regulatory targets and mechanistic insights into the therapeutic response were elucidated through correlation analyses between gene expression profiles and pathological indicators. This study provides a mechanistic and computational basis for precision targeted therapy, validates the efficacy and safety of microneedle delivery in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model, and demonstrates its potential application in local drug delivery strategies.",
