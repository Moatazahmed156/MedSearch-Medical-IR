  "title": "Congenital vascular abnormality presenting as life-long asthma.",
  "abstract": "A female in her early 40s with a lifelong asthma diagnosis presented with worsening exertional dyspnoea and a dry cough despite being medically optimised. A clinical review revealed inspiratory stridor and swallowing difficulties, prompting further investigations. Spirometry showed an obstructive pattern and an elevated Empey index. This, along with a supporting flow-volume loop, raised suspicion of upper airway obstruction. Subsequent CT imaging (including an aortic angiogram) revealed a right-sided aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery arising from a Kommerrell diverticulum. This formed a vascular ring compressing the trachea and oesophagus. Surgical intervention resulted in significant symptomatic and physiological improvement, with a markedly increased FEV",
