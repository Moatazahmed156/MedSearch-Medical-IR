  "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is an increasing concern as more people pause or defer vaccinations for themselves and their children. A faith community nurse project in a rural Colorado county aimed to counter influenza vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccine uptake by collaborating with the public health department. Promising results among individuals who accepted the flu vaccine at a church vaccination event emphasize the value of faith communities actively seeking partnerships with public health services to increase vaccine uptake.",
