  "title": "Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) Peel-Enriched Pomace as Natural Anticancer Agents: Preclinical Evidence from Breast Carcinoma Models Supporting Preventive and Personalized Treatment Strategies.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women (∼25% of new cases). Plants adapted to specific niches accumulate secondary metabolites with bioactivity, including anticancer effects. To evaluate the chemopreventive and treatment potential of Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) peel-enriched pomace powder in BC models, hypothesizing system-level effects and synergy with standard therapy. Chemistry was profiled by LC-DAD-MS/LC-DAD from two extracts: BIL BIL Bilberry pomace shows multitarget anticancer activity across BC models; translational studies should confirm mechanisms, refine dosing, and explore biomarker-guided use.",
