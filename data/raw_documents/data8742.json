    "abstract": "Since the inception of Molecular Therapy in 2000, the field of gene therapy has made remarkable progress, evolving from no approved clinical products to 23 clinical gene therapy products today. In this review, we aim to capture the transformative changes in the field by surveying the literature over this period, with a particular focus on advancements in gene delivery vector technology, disease and tissue targeting, and the revolutionary molecular tools that have become central to the field. We also discuss the current challenges facing gene therapy and the need for greater collaboration to ensure its accessibility worldwide.",
