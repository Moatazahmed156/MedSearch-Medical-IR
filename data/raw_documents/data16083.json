  "title": "Maple Quality Testing: An Evaluation of Maple Syrup Compliance with Grade A Standards.",
  "abstract": "This study assesses the quality of pure maple syrup sold online to consumers. It aims to determine how likely consumers are to receive syrup that meets legal grading standards. Grade A clarity, color, density, and flavor tests were performed using visual color comparison to known standards, refractometry, and sensory analysis, respectively. The lowest compliance rates were observed in the color test for Golden syrup samples, with 1.7% in 2021, 26.4% in 2023, and 21.9% in 2024. The 2021 test was delayed due to COVID-19, which increased cases of color darkening. Flavor compliance was the second lowest, with Dark samples exhibiting compliance rates of 79.6% in 2021, 79.5% in 2023, and 73.9% in 2024, due to their ability to mask flavor, making it difficult for producers to detect. Syrup color often fails Grade A standards, especially for Golden syrup, likely due to producer grading issues and post-packaging darkening. The producer's ability to accurately evaluate flavor differs between Golden and Dark syrup, with higher observed flavor compliance for Golden syrup and lower compliance due to off-flavors in Dark syrup, as observed in this study. Using proper instruments to verify defects, accuracy, and limitations is essential, and consistent staff training and unbiased feedback are vital in preventing human error.",
