  "abstract": "To review the application progress of customized steel plates in osteotomy and orthopedic treatment for knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and provide reference for orthopedic surgeons and researchers. Extensive review of the literature on customized steel plates for osteotomies and knee-preserving surgeries for KOA, 2015-2025, with an overview of the principles of customized steel plate design, clinical applications, and future directions, describing their advantages and shortcomings. Customized steel plates have demonstrated many advantages in osteotomy and orthopedic treatment of KOA, which not only enhance surgical outcomes and optimize mechanical properties, but also reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, high cost, long manufacturing period, and selection of patient indications are still important factors restricting their use. Customized steel plates show promising potential in treating KOA. Not only do they reduce surgical duration and enhance postoperative healing outcomes, but they also effectively lower the incidence of postoperative complications, thereby improving patients' quality of life. 综述定制钢板在截骨矫形治疗膝骨关节炎（knee osteoarthritis，KOA）中的应用进展，为骨科医生和研究人员提供参考。. 广泛查阅2015年—2025年定制钢板用于截骨矫形保膝手术治疗KOA的相关文献，对定制钢板设计原理、临床应用及未来发展方向进行综述，阐述其优势及不足。. 定制钢板在截骨矫形治疗KOA中展现出诸多优势，不仅可以提升手术效果和优化力学性能，并且能够减少术后并发症的发生。但高成本、制造周期较长、患者适应证选择等仍是制约使用的重要因素。. 定制钢板用于治疗KOA方面有发展潜力，其不仅能减少手术时间和提升术后愈合效果，而且能够有效降低术后并发症的发生率，从而改善患者的生活质量。.",
