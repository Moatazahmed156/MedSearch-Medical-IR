    "abstract": "A marginal zone B-cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma which is normally located at the margins of the secondary lymph node follicles. According to 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, there are three main types classified according to the location of invasion: nodal lymphoma in the lymph nodes, splenic lymphoma in the spleen, and extranodal lymphoma in other locations. Recently, we have experienced a rare case of primary nodal marginal zone lymphoma that arose in the lower eyelid. Therefore, we report this case with a review of literature.",
