    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a critical role in nanotoxicity. Various types of nanoparticles are known to induce oxidative stress by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cellular uptake of nanoparticles and intracellular metal ion release are important factors for intracellular ROS generation. Besides, ROS generation can result from interactions of nanoparticles and cells that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo, nanoparticles induce the secretion of cytokines, which, in turn, induce secondary oxidative stress via generation of ROS and free radicals. However, not all nanoparticles induce oxidative stress. Intracellular ROS generation by nanoparticles depends on their physical and chemical properties, such as the crystalline phase, adsorption ability, and solubility. Even if the particle size is nanoscale (1-100 nm), physically and chemically inactive particles do not induce oxidative stress. Thus, the particle size is not a direct influencing factor in nanoparticle-induced oxidative stress.",
