    "abstract": "Supernumerary nipples are common anomalies, and their significance is usually limited to cosmetic concerns. However, a high index of suspicion should be maintained during physical examinations, because any disease process that involves anatomically normal breasts may affect aberrantly located breasts or nipples as well. These anomalies may be associated with several systemic disorders, particularly urinary tract abnormalities.",
