  "title": "Curcumin in colorectal cancer: preventive strategies and therapeutic mechanisms.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading global cause of cancer-related deaths, influenced by both genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors. Inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis account for a minority of cases, while modifiable risk factors like diet, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity significantly contribute to incidence rates. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from turmeric, has garnered interest due to its anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, particularly in CRC prevention and therapy. Despite promising preclinical data, challenges such as poor bioavailability hinder its clinical translation. Innovative delivery systems are under development to enhance its therapeutic potential. This review explores CRC's epidemiology, risk factors, current treatments, and curcumin's emerging role in management strategies.",
