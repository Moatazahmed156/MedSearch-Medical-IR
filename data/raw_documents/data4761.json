    "abstract": "In this research, atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a flat tip cantilever is utilized to measure Young's modulus of a whole yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741). The results acquired from AFM are similar to those obtained using a microfluidic chip compression system. The mechanical properties of single yeast cells are important parameters which can be examined using AFM. Conventional studies apply AFM with a sharp cantilever tip to indent the cell and measure the force-indentation curve, from which Young's modulus can be calculated. However, sharp tips introduce problems because the shape variation can lead to a different result and cannot represent the stiffness of the whole cell. It can lead to a lack of broader meaning when evaluating Young's modulus of yeast cells. In this report, we confirm the differences in results obtained when measuring the compression of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) bead using a commercial sharp tip versus a unique flat tip. The flat tip effectively avoids tip-derived errors, so we use this method to compress whole yeast cells and generate a force–deformation curve. We believe our proposed method is effective for evaluating Young's modulus of whole yeast cells.",
