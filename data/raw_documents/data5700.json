    "abstract": "Gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system tract through the gut-brain axis. Such communication involves neuronal, endocrine, and immunological mechanisms, which allows for the microbiota to affect and respond to various behaviors and psychiatric conditions. In addition, the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) may interact with and even change the abundance of microbiome to potentially cause adverse effects or aggravate the disorders inherent in the disease. The regulate effects of gut microbiome has been described in several psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression, but only a few reports have discussed the role of microbiota in AAPDs-induced Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive disorders. The following review systematically summarizes current knowledge about the gut microbiota in behavior and psychiatric illness, with the emphasis of an important role of the microbiome in the metabolism of schizophrenia and the potential for AAPDs to change the gut microbiota to promote adverse events. Prebiotics and probiotics are microbiota-management tools with documented efficacy for metabolic disturbances and cognitive deficits. Novel therapies for targeting microbiota for alleviating AAPDs-induced adverse effects are also under fast development.",
