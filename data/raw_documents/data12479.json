  "abstract": "Analyzing T-cell subsets in and between primary colorectal cancer (pCRC) and adjacent non-tumor mucosa (NM) may reveal distinct prognostic value in stage IV versus stages I-III patients. Specimens of pCRC and NM were collected retrospectively from stage IV patients (n = 55) with synchronous liver metastases (LM), and stages I-III patients (n = 44) who developed metachronous LM. CD3",
