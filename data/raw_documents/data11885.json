  "title": "The gut microbiome as a potential predictive biomarker for breast cancer: emerging association and geographic differences.",
  "abstract": "The gut microbiome may influence breast cancer (BC) development by modulating estrogen metabolism, immune responses, and microbial metabolites. Altered microbial patterns have been reported in BC, but their value as predictive biomarkers remains uncertain. We reviewed 13 case-control studies that compared gut microbiome composition in women with and without BC, focusing on diversity, compositional shifts, and geographic variation. Reduced microbial richness ( Despite heterogeneity, converging evidence supports reduced diversity and shifts in select taxa, particularly enrichment of ",
