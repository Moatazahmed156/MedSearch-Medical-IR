  "abstract": "Predicting which people with HIV are at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) would facilitate the targeted use of preventative strategies. This project investigated novel biomarkers of CAD and determined the longitudinal pattern of change approaching CAD. A retrospective single-centre case‒control study of samples from people with HIV and with CAD (cases,  Immediately prior to CAD diagnosis, cases had higher D-dimer, hsCRP and, IL-6. Twelve months prior to the event, the only biomarker with a significant difference was IL-6 (2.4 pg/mL [1.6, 3.4] compared with 1.8 pg/mL [1.1, 33]). LBP, IL-1RA, D-dimer, hsCRP, and IL-6 demonstrated statistically significant increases in cases compared with controls 12 months prior to CAD, but all were stable in the period before this. Inflammatory biomarkers were strongly correlated and correlated with markers of HIV control (CD4 cell count and HIV VL). IL-6, hsCRP, and D-dimer were associated with CAD and increased in the 12 months prior to the event. Further work is needed to determine whether an increase in these biomarkers could be used to prompt further investigation for CAD in people with HIV.",
