    "abstract": "Because life expectancy has increased greatly in the past few decades for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), transition to the adult healthcare setting has become a necessity to continue disease management. Transition for young adults with SCD is associated with declining health outcomes, including increased acute care use and mortality. Nurses can assist young adults with SCD who are at risk after transition by assessing the young adult's ability to carry out disease self-management, facilitating the supportive role of the family, and recognizing young adults who may have difficulty accessing healthcare resources and providers.",
