  "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the impact of chronic hepatitis B on fatty acids (FA) composition in erythrocyte membranes (RBC) and plasma, and its effect on lipoxin A4 and resolvin D1 levels. Sixty participants were enrolled: 30 hepatitis B patients (15 with cirrhosis, 15 without) and 30 healthy controls. Fatty acids content in plasma and RBC membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. Serum lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and resolvin D1 (RvD1) were measured via enzyme immunoassay. Principal component analysis (PCA) assessed correlations between fatty acid composition, LXA4 and RvD1 levels. Hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis exhibited significantly lower plasma lipoxin A4 (1812 pg/mL) compared to controls (2230 pg/mL) and non-cirrhotic hepatitis B patients (2453 pg/mL). Plasma n-3 FA levels (15.4% vs. 8.7%) and the n-3/n-6 ratio (0.8 vs. 0.4) were significantly reduced in cirrhotic patients. PCA data revealed associations between LXA4 and saturated fatty acids, and between n-3 FA and RvD1 pathways, suggesting disrupted lipid-mediated inflammation resolution. Erythrocyte membranes showed elevated trans C18:1 in cirrhotic hepatitis B. Chronic HBV infection, especially with cirrhosis, alters fatty acid profiles and reduces lipoxin A4 level, contributing to persistent hepatic inflammation and highlighting potential lipid-targeted therapies.",
