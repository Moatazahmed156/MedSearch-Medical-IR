    "abstract": "Metabolism drives function, on both an organismal and a cellular level. In T cell biology, metabolic remodeling is intrinsically linked to cellular development, activation, function, differentiation, and survival. After naive T cells are activated, increased demands for metabolic currency in the form of ATP, as well as biomass for cell growth, proliferation, and the production of effector molecules, are met by rewiring cellular metabolism. Consequently, pharmacological strategies are being developed to perturb or enhance selective metabolic processes that are skewed in immune-related pathologies. Here we review the most recent advances describing the metabolic changes that occur during the T cell lifecycle. We discuss how T cell metabolism can have profound effects on health and disease and where it might be a promising target to treat a variety of pathologies.",
