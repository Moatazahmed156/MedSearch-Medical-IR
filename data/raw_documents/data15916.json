  "title": "Bilingual digital health intervention to improve COVID-19 self-testing intentions among Hispanic adults.",
  "abstract": "Testing remains one of the most effective strategies for reducing the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 rapid antigen tests are well-suited for at-home use; however, several barriers, including language, hinder the widespread adoption of self-testing. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the impact of a bilingual digital health intervention on self-efficacy, intentions, and willingness to self-administer a COVID-19 antigen rapid test. Participants ( Participants in the bilingual digital health intervention reported significantly higher intentions to self-test for COVID-19 ( Our findings suggest that the bilingual digital health intervention may have a positive impact on enhancing intentions and willingness to self-administer a COVID-19 antigen rapid test. These findings highlight the potential of culturally and linguistically tailored digital health interventions to reduce barriers and promote access to at-home COVID-19 testing in Hispanic communities. Notably, to help alleviate cost barriers associated with purchasing COVID-19 rapid antigen test kits, the research team collaborated with a highly qualified team of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to disseminate approximately 4,500 free COVID-19 test kits throughout the community.",
