    "abstract": "Metastatic spinal cord syndromes usually result from neural compression by adjacent vertebral disease but are occasionally caused by intradural or intramedullary disease. MRI is the most accurate method for evaluation of such syndromes. Knowledge of the relevant imaging appearances and therapeutic options enables the radiologist to make an accurate assessment of the extent of disease and contribute information relevant to treatment planning.",
