  "title": "Brain-heart functional network dysfunction in temporal lobe epilepsy: A microstate-based analysis.",
  "abstract": "Epilepsy patients face significantly elevated cardiovascular risks, with cardiac arrhythmias occurring 2-3 times more frequently than in the general population. Current knowledge of brain-heart functional coupling abnormalities in epilepsy, particularly during interictal periods, remains limited. We investigated brain-heart interplay characteristics in temporal lobe epilepsy through synchronized electroencephalographic-electrocardiographic analysis using a synthetic data generation model and microstate analysis. We enrolled 52 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (mean age = 33.4 ± 12.7 years) and 42 age-matched healthy controls (mean age = 31.95 ± 11.03 years). Twenty-minute artifact-free electroencephalographic segments were analyzed during resting states. Four directional brain-heart coupling sequences were extracted: C Six microstate topologies were consistently identified across all brain-heart interplay sequences, with temporal lobe epilepsy patients demonstrating significantly more complex and unstable topological characteristics compared to healthy controls. For C Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by profound disruptions in brain-heart functional coupling during interictal periods, manifesting as altered microstate topographies and temporal dynamics. These findings establish microstate-based analysis as a promising framework for characterizing brain-heart axis dysfunction in epilepsy.",
