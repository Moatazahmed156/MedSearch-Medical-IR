  "abstract": "Although systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) have garnered attention as novel inflammatory response markers in various clinical contexts, their application in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating and validating the relationships between SII, SIRI, and the risks for all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in this specific patient population. 1222 participants diagnosed with STEMI and who underwent urgent PCI were included in the study. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were employed to analyze the association between log After a 1-year follow-up, 106 experienced all-cause mortality, and 163 experienced MACEs. Higher levels of log Log",
