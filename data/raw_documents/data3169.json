    "abstract": "Two weeks after her first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, a 38-year-old woman developed acute-onset pain and ulceration within a tattoo on the distal left leg. Progressive ulceration was noted approximately one week following her second dose of the vaccine. A biopsy revealed sarcoidal granulomas and a dense neutrophilic infiltrate. Ultimately, the final diagnosis of what we have termed a \"sarcoidal reaction with a Sweet-like phenomenon\" was made; the patient experienced a reduction in pain and re-epithelialization of the ulcers with two weeks of the use of topical clobetasol 0.05% cream twice daily.",
