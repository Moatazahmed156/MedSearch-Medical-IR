  "abstract": "The incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) may be a valuable tool for measuring exercise tolerance in patients after a hospital admission with COVID-19. However, the safety, physiological response and repeatability of the ISWT are unknown in this cohort. The present study aimed to explore the properties of this test using the Post-Hospital COVID-19 (PHOSP-COVID) study. Participants performed two ISWTs, with a 30-min rest between tests, at 5 and 12 months post-hospital discharge for COVID-19. Heart rate and fingertip peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded pre- and post-test. Reasons for test termination were noted. 1593 individuals (median (interquartile range) age 58 (50-66) years and body mass index 31.2 (27.6-35.8) kg·m The ISWT appeared to be safe in this large cohort, supporting use of this field walking test for this population in clinical and research settings. A familiarisation test is recommended, with further study needed to determine the number of familiarisation tests required to achieve acceptable within-day repeatability.",
