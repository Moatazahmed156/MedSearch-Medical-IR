  "title": "Mycoplasma Rash With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms: A Report of Two Cases.",
  "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in school-aged children. Various cutaneous reactions to M. pneumonia have been described, including reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption, morbilliform eruptions, and vasculitis. This study highlights two cases of Mycoplasma infection that presented with a morbilliform eruption and had clinical and laboratory findings similar to drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), a pattern not well documented in the literature, and emphasizes the clinical manifestations that help distinguish between these conditions.",
