  "abstract": "We discovered and validated miRNA biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, as more easily accessible biofluids are preferred for clinical assays, we compared the performance of the AD miRNAs in CSF to plasma to determine their potential use as AD biomarkers in this readily available biofluid. We obtained 320 donor- and date-matched normal control (NC) and AD CSF and plasma samples from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative, then analyzed 57 candidate AD miRNAs in both biofluids by RT-qPCR. For analysis, we divided the sample sets into 80% for discovery and 20% for validation. We then used predictive modeling of the 57 candidate AD miRNAs in the discovery phase to develop AD classifiers for each biofluid that showed similar performance in both CSF and plasma. However, in the validation phase AD classification performance was only maintained for the plasma models. When the plasma miRNA models were combined with clinical predictors (APOE genotype, age, sex, years of education) there was a boost in classification performance to a level comparable to the CSF proteins (Aβ",
