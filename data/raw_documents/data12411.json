  "title": "Dual-Path Convolutional Neural Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation Attention for Lung and Colon Histopathology Classification.",
  "abstract": "Lung and colon cancers remain among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for rapid and accurate histopathological diagnosis. Manual examination of biopsy slides is often time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, which highlights the importance of developing reliable and explainable automated diagnostic systems. This study presents DPCSE-Net, a lightweight dual-path convolutional neural network enhanced with a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention mechanism for lung and colon cancer classification. The dual-path structure captures both fine-grained cellular textures and global contextual information through multiscale feature extraction, while the SE attention module adaptively recalibrates channel responses to emphasize discriminative features. To enhance transparency and interpretability, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), attention heatmaps, and Integrated Gradients are employed to visualize class-specific activation patterns and verify that the model's focus aligns with diagnostically relevant tissue regions. Evaluated on the publicly available LC25000 dataset, DPCSE-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with 99.88% accuracy and F1-score, while maintaining low computational complexity. Ablation experiments confirmed the contribution of the dual-path design and SE module, and qualitative analyses demonstrated the model's strong interpretability. These results establish DPCSE-Net as an accurate, efficient, and explainable framework for computer-aided histopathological diagnosis, supporting the broader goals of explainable AI in computer vision.",
