    "abstract": "Opportunities for using inpatients for learning physical examination skills have decreased. In peer physical examination (PPE), students act as models for each other to learn skills in physical examination and other non-invasive procedures. PPE is extensively used and has high acceptability, but nevertheless poses some challenges. PPE may be less acceptable among culturally and linguistically diverse students. In the light of our findings and the published literature, best practice points are described.",
