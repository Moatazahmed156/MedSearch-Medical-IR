  "abstract": "Asthma diagnosis can be confirmed through the observation of significant bronchodilator response (BDR) measured by peak expiratory flow (PEF) during home monitoring or by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV To use salbutamol administration after an exercise challenge test in children as a model of bronchodilation to assess how well relative change in PEF reflects improvement in lung function, as defined by increase in FEV We retrospectively studied 326 free running exercise challenge tests with spirometry in children 6-16 years old. To assess congruency and differences between relative changes in PEF and FEV Relative change in PEF was, on average, greater than that in FEV Increase in PEF is not an accurate measure of BDR compared with increase in FEV",
