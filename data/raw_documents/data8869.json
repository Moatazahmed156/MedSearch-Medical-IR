    "abstract": "Quality improvement (QI) has become an integral part of healthcare. Despite efforts to improve the reporting of QI through frameworks such as the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines, there is no standard or well-accepted guide to evaluate published QI for rigor, validity, generalizability, and applicability. User's Guides for evaluation of published clinical research have been employed routinely for over 25 years; however, similar tools for critical appraisal of QI are limited and uncommonly used. In this article we propose an approach to guide the critical review of QI reports focused on evaluating the methodology, improvement results, and applicability and feasibility for implementation in other settings. The resulting Quality Improvement Critical Knowledge (QUICK) Tool can be used by those reviewing manuscripts submitted for publication, as well as healthcare providers seeking to understand how to apply published QI to their local context.",
