    "abstract": "With 240,000 new cases and 152,000 deaths per year, ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies. Late diagnosis because of asymptomatic development in early stages and resistance to existing treatments are the major causes of therapeutic failure in ovarian cancer. The recent discovery of tens of thousands of long non-coding RNAs and their action as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in pathways matching all the hallmarks of cancer in most - if not all - malignancies have attracted attention of the scientific community. A growing number of studies have implicated lncRNAs in diverse aspects of ovarian carcinoma biology. We present lncRNAs which have been involved in response to the different drugs currently used for the treatment of ovarian cancers, from first-line platinum salts and taxanes to the newly available PARP inhibitors. The data already available supports the potential use of several lncRNAs, alone or in combination with other molecules, as potential biomarkers for the prediction of response to treatment. Understanding the determinants of their action might reveal new potential therapeutic targets.",
