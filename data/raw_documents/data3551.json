    "abstract": "Zika virus was considered an innocent pathogen while restricted to the African and Asian population; however, after reaching the Americas in March 2015, it became a global threat. Despite usually causing mild or no symptoms in infected adults, Zika virus displays a different behavior toward fetuses. When infected during gestation, fetuses have their immature neural cells killed by the virus and consequently have devastating findings at birth. In the past year the drastic effects of Zika virus infection in newborns include neurological, ophthalmological, audiological, and skeletal abnormalities. These findings represent a new entity called congenital Zika syndrome. We summarize the ocular findings of congenital Zika Syndrome, as well as the current understanding of the illness, systemic manifestations, laboratory investigation, differential diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment for this disorder.",
