    "abstract": "Root hairs are cells from the root epidermis that grow as long tubular bulges perpendicular to the root. They can grow in a variety of mechanical or chemical environments. Their mechanical properties are mainly due to their stiff cell wall which also constitutes a physical barrier between the cell and its environment. Thus, it is essential to be able to quantify the cell wall mechanical properties and their adaptation to environmental cues. Here, we present a technique we developed to measure the Young's (elastic) modulus of the root hair cell wall. In essence, using custom-made glass microplates as cantilevers of calibrated stiffness, we are able to measure the force necessary to bend a single living root hair. From these experiments one can determine the stiffness and Young's modulus of the root hair cell wall.",
