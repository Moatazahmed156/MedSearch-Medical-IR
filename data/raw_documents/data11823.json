  "title": "Investigating the role of MYLK2 in breast cancer prognosis and assessing its clinical application value.",
  "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the mechanistic role of MYLK2 (myosin light chain kinase 2) in breast cancer and assess its potential as a prognostic biomarker for clinical applications. We performed a comprehensive analysis using gene expression data from breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression models were employed to evaluate the association between MYLK2 expression levels and patient survival outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that MYLK2 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal adjacent tissues (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that high MYLK2 expression correlates with poorer overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified MYLK2 as an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcomes in breast cancer patients. This study elucidates the critical biological functions of MYLK2 in breast cancer, suggesting that it may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker. These findings provide new insights for early diagnosis and treatment strategies in breast cancer management.",
