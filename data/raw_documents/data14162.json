  "title": "Lactose-Modified Hyaluronic Acid Molecule Attenuates In Vitro Chondrocyte Inflammation.",
  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative whole joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and inflammation. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding lectin secreted into the extracellular space, binds to glycosylated components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), modulating cell-matrix interactions and inflammation. This study aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Hylach Chondrocyte viability, after both Hylach HA and Hylach Hylach",
