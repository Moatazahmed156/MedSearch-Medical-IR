  "title": "Modulation of Liquid-to-Solid Phase Transition in Coacervates for Neurodegenerative Disease Treatments.",
  "abstract": "Coacervates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation represent a fundamental model for protocell and serve as a membraneless organelle in living cells, modulating various biological processes. During aging or under stress, protein misfolding and oligomerization trigger aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transition (LSPT), a process driven by multivalent interactions. These phase transitions disrupt cellular equilibrium, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The regulatory strategies is summarize to enhance molecular interactions in coacervate LSPT into three categories, including physical stimulation, molecular modulation, and sequence regulation. This review aims to establish a conceptual framework for modulating coacervate LSPT and further explores potential clinical treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",
