    "abstract": "Advancements in biomaterial-based spinal cord tissue engineering technology have profoundly influenced regenerative medicine, providing innovative solutions for both spinal cord organoid development and engineered spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. In spinal cord organoids, biomaterials offer a supportive microenvironment that mimics the natural extracellular matrix, facilitating cell differentiation and organization and advancing the understanding of spinal cord development and pathophysiology. Furthermore, biomaterials are essential in constructing engineered spinal cords for SCI repair. The incorporation of biomaterials with growth factors, fabrication of ordered scaffold structures, and artificial spinal cord assemblies are critical insights for SCI to ensure structural integrity, enhance cell viability, and promote neural regeneration in transplantation. In summary, this review summarizes the contribution of biomaterials to the spinal cord organoids progression and discusses strategies for biomaterial-based spinal cord engineering in SCI therapy. These achievements underscore the transformative potential of biomaterials to improve treatment options for SCI and accelerate future clinical applications.",
