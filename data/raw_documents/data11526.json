  "abstract": "Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitors show considerable translational potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases; however, limited literature exists regarding their application in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In this study, through structural modification, we designed and synthesized a series of RIPK1 inhibitors based on a benzothiazole-quinazoline core scaffold. Twenty compounds exhibited potent RIPK1 kinase inhibitory activity (IC",
