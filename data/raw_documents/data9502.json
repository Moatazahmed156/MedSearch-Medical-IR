  "title": "Exploration of the mechanisms of HLWDD on skeletal muscle lesions under the influence of diabetes based on bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation.",
  "abstract": "To investigate the molecular mechanisms of Huanglian Wendan Decoction in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated skeletal muscle lesions via integrated bioinformatics and experimental validation. T2DM-related skeletal muscle microarray datasets from the GEO database were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes ( HLWDD significantly reduced HbA1c, blood lipid, glucose, and renal dysfunction markers ( HLWDD alleviated T2DM skeletal muscle injury by modulating apoptosis-related pathways and immune interactions, as supported by multi-omics and experimental validation. This study provides novel therapeutic targets and mechanistic insights into HLWDD for T2DM management.",
