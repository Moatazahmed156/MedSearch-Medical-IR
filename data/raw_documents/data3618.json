    "abstract": "A fragile site on the X chromosome has been implicated in mental retardation and behavioral problems among both males and females. The fragile-X syndrome is second only to Down syndrome among causes of mental retardation associated with cytogenetic abnormalities. The clinical phenotype is extremely variable. During the early years, many affected children demonstrate normal or near-normal intellect and development. Folic acid may be of benefit before puberty.",
