    "abstract": "Synovial osteochondromatosis is an extremely rare benign condition in children and adolescents that have joint pain as a presenting manifestation. It is usually monoarticular with the knee as the most common affected joint. In this article, we describe the case of a female adolescent suffering from debilitating chronic right knee pain initially mimicking juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who was subsequently diagnosed with primary synovial osteochondromatosis. We present a review of synovial osteochondromatosis focusing on the clinical manifestations, radiographic features, histopathologic findings, and treatment, with a summarized review of pediatric patients with initial musculoskeletal presentations who were ultimately diagnosed as synovial osteochondromatosis. Although synovial osteochondromatosis is rare in children and adolescents, this condition should be included in the differential diagnosis of joint pain and may mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Appropriate diagnostic radiography, including both plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, is necessary to accurately diagnose this condition. We also emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to managing patients with synovial osteochondromatosis.",
