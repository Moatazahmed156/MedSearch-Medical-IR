    "abstract": "Background: Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among older adults. As an older population grows in the United States that has a tolerant attitude toward marijuana use, the dynamics of marijuana use and the effects of marijuana on personal, social, and health outcomes among older adults require attention. Objectives: This review summarizes epidemiological literature on marijuana use among older adults. Method: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, AgeLine, and an online search engine from January 2000 to December 2017, resulting in 18 articles. Results: The greatest increase in marijuana use was observed among those in the older adult population 50 years or older, and those 65 years or older had the greatest increase in marijuana use in the older adult population. Common correlates of marijuana use among those in the older population included being male, being unmarried, having multiple chronic diseases, having psychological stress, and using other substances such as alcohol, tobacco, other illicit drugs, and prescription drugs. Conclusion: The increased use of marijuana in older populations requires surveillance and additional research to understand the use and effects of marijuana in older populations to avoid negative health outcomes.",
