  "title": "A New Toolbox to Label Zinc-MTF1 Responsive Neuronal Populations Unravels Cellular Congruence between MTF1 Responses and T-type Calcium Channelopathies in an Experimental Model of Epilepsy.",
  "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of epilepsy and usually manifests after serious brain insults, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, and status epilepticus (SE). Previously, we identified a new epilepsy-associated transcriptional control mechanism that relies on the zinc-dependent transcriptional activator metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (MTF1). MTF1 is one of the key transcription factors involved in intracellular metal ion balance. Upon excessive increase in the concentration of zinc in the cytoplasm, zinc can bind to MTF1, inducing its translocation to the nucleus to activate the expression of metal-response element (MRE)-containing genes, including metallothioneins and the T-type calcium channel Ca",
