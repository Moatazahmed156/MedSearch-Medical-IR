    "abstract": "Teenage pregnancy increases the threat of depression because of its many factors. Pregnancy during young adulthood may also have several risk factors for depression compared to older pregnancies. However, data on depression in young adult pregnancies are lacking. This study investigated the association between teenage and young adult pregnancy and depression. Data from the Japan Environment and Children's study was used as a nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between age groups (14-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, ≥ 35 years) and depression, adjusted for behavioral and sociodemographic characteristics. Depression was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. In total, 96,808 pregnant women responded to the questionnaire. Teenage (14-19 years) and young adult (20-24 years) pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of depression compared to older pregnancy (≥ 35 years) (teenage: OR 4.28, 95% confidence interval, CI [3.24-5.64]; young adult: OR 3.00, 95% CI [2.64-3.41]). After adjusting for covariates, the magnitude of the risk of depression was attenuated. However, teenage and young adult pregnancy remained at a significantly increased risk of depression compared to older pregnancy (teenage: OR 2.38, 95% CI [1.77-3.21]; young adult: OR 2.14, 95% CI [1.87-2.46]). Our findings indicate that teenage and young adults' pregnancy are at an increased risk of depression compared to older pregnancy. These findings suggest prioritizing teenage and young pregnant women for prevention and interventions related to depression.",
