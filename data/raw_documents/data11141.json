  "title": "Comorbid Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Heart Failure.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist, driven by shared risk factors (smoking, inflammation) and bidirectional pathophysiological interactions, worsening prognosis. This review synthesizes evidence from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus (2005-2025), using keywords: COPD, heart failure, mechanism, and biomarkers. Included studies encompassed epidemiological, mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects. COPD-HF comorbidity complicates diagnosis due to overlapping symptoms and limitations of spirometry/imaging. Selective β1-blockers and bronchodilators show efficacy with cautious monitoring. Non-pharmacological interventions (rehabilitation, vaccination) reduce exacerbations. Multidisciplinary care integrating cardiopulmonary management improves outcomes. Optimizing COPD-HF management requires personalized strategies, multidisciplinary collaboration, and standardized protocols. Future research should prioritize β-blocker safety in advanced trials and artificial intelligence-driven predictive models to enhance care.",
