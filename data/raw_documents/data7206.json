    "abstract": "Determining the stage- and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression shown by the embryo and fetus will provide information about the control of normal development. Identification of alterations in these patterns associated with specific abnormal phenotypes will also be informative regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, qualitative and quantitative changes in gene expression that deviate from the norm may provide a potential marker system for predicting future developmental defects, a system that would be particularly useful in preimplantation embryo technologies before recipient transfer. However, there are a number of important issues regarding the interpretation and relevance of many gene expression studies currently undertaken that are often not considered or are ignored. Even when rigorous methodology is applied to detect differences in gene expression, their functional significance is rarely defined. This review discusses the relevance of gene expression changes as diagnostic markers in relation to protein and epigenetic changes and indicates that gene expression studies should be rigorously designed and interpreted to yield meaningful results.",
