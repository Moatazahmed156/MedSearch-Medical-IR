    "abstract": "Suicide among college students is a challenging problem globally. Yet, the association between sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation remains unclear. This study aims to understand if depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between sleep quality and suicide ideation and whether the interaction between depressive symptoms and sleep quality on suicidal ideation is additive. A total of 1182 college students were recruited, and sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation were assessed using questionnaires. Univariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, linear regression models, and the Sobel test were performed. The results showed that, among college students, poor sleep quality was positively associated with suicidal ideation, and the association was mediated through depressive symptoms. Moreover, there was a significant additive interaction between poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms on suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that, in the process of preventing and treating suicidal ideation in college students with sleep disorders, we should focus on the evaluation and intervention of depressive symptoms and adopt multidisciplinary team interventions for college students with sleep disorders and depression.",
