    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer is traditionally thought of as being a disease associated with alcohol and tobacco abuse and deprivation. It was the fourth most common cancer in males in Scotland in 2000 and just over 1,000 cases were diagnosed in 2007. As smoking becomes less prevalent, a fall in the incidence of head and neck cancer could be anticipated; however, increasing evidence of other aetiological factors contributing to the diagnosis of head and neck cancer, particularly oropharyngeal cancer in non-smoking, little-drinking populations, is impacting on that perception. This review will aim to look at current aetiological factors for head and neck cancer, along with current therapeutic modalities in treatment of this disease.",
