  "abstract": "To report on the Italian validation of the Child Epilepsy Quality of Life Questionnaire (CHEQOL-25), including both the child self-report and parent-proxy versions. The validation procedure was conducted at a single Italian centre between July 2024 and July 2025, involving 252 children with epilepsy and their parents. A forward-backward translation process was carried out in line with established best-practice guidelines. Data collection included family interviews and medical chart reviews. Psychometric evaluation covered reliability and validity. All items exceeded the accepted thresholds (≥ 0.78) for both content validity and comprehensibility.
