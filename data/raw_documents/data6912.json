    "abstract": "In traumatic brain injury (TBI), future integration of multimodal monitoring of cerebral physiology and high-frequency signal processing techniques, with advanced neuroimaging, proteomic and genomic analysis, provides an opportunity to explore the molecular pathways involved in various aspects of cerebral physiologic dysfunction in vivo. The main issue with early and rapid discovery in this field of personalized medicine is the expertise and complexity of data involved. This brief communication highlights the CAnadian High-Resolution Traumatic Brain Injury (CAHR-TBI) Research Collaborative, which has been formed from centers with specific expertise in the area of high-frequency physiologic monitoring/processing, and outlines its objectives.",
