    "abstract": "Type 17 T helper (Th17) cells, which are a subtype of CD4+ T helper cells, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and GM-CSF, which play crucial roles in immune defence and protection against fungal and extracellular pathogen invasion. However, dysfunction of Th17 cell immunity mediates inflammatory responses and exacerbates tissue damage. This pathological process initiated by Th17 cells is common in kidney diseases associated with renal injury, such as glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease and acute kidney injury. Therefore, targeting Th17 cells to treat kidney diseases has been a hot topic in recent years. This article reviews the mechanisms of Th17 cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmune responses in kidney diseases and discusses the related clinical drugs that modulate Th17 cell fate in kidney disease treatment.",
