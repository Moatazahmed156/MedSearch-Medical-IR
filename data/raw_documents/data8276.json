    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix proteins play a critical role in dermal wound healing by mediating matrix-cell interactions and re-establishing the dermal architecture and environment. Fibulin-5 is an elastin-binding protein essential for elastic fiber development in vivo, and it has recently been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. Here, we use mice deficient for the fibulin-5 gene (fbln5) to examine the role of fibulin-5 and the effect of the loss of elastic fibers in dermal wound healing. Fbln5 is upregulated in the granulation tissue 14 days after full-thickness wounding in wild-type mice, before the formation of elastic fibers. Although wounded fbln5(-/-) skin showed enhanced neovascularization compared to the wild-type skin, no difference in the rate of wound closure was observed between mutant and wild-type mice. In addition, a breaking strength test revealed that there was no difference in breaking stress or strain between wild-type and fbln5(-/-) wounded skin. These results suggest that fibulin-5 and elastic fibers are not directly involved in short-term wound healing. Clearly, the long-term effect of the absence of fibulin-5 on the function and integrity of regenerated skin needs to be further addressed.",
