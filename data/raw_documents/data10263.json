  "abstract": "Secondary preventive treatment for patients with known coronary artery disease reduces the risk of new cardiovascular events. We studied the extent to which patients with known coronary artery disease who were admitted with acute myocardial infarction had achieved the treatment targets for secondary prevention. The study used data from the Norwegian Myocardial Infarction Registry and included patients below the age of 85 years with known coronary artery disease who were admitted with type 1 myocardial infarction to Norwegian hospitals in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2022. Out of 74,993 patients below the age of 85 years who were admitted with type 1 acute myocardial infarction, 22,825 (30.4 %) had known coronary artery disease. Of these patients, 24.4 % were women and the median age was 72 years (interquartile range 64-78). The proportion with known coronary artery disease was stable during the study period. The proportion of non-smokers increased from 71 % to 75 % (+0.7 % per year), the proportion of patients with a healthy weight decreased from 33 % to 29 % (-1.8 % per year), and the proportion receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy increased from 88 % to 91 % (+0.3 % per year). The proportion receiving lipid-lowering therapy (77.0 %) and the proportion who had LDL cholesterol < 1.8 mmol/L (21 %) was stable. The proportion of patients with blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg decreased from 43 % to 30 % (-4.6 % per year until 2020, then unchanged). The study demonstrates the need for measures to improve secondary preventive treatment in patients with coronary artery disease in Norway.",
