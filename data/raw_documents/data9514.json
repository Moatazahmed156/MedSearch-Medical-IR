  "title": "Accessory Hepatic Tissue Attached to the Gallbladder: An Incidental Intraoperative Finding.",
  "abstract": "Ectopic liver tissue is a rare developmental anomaly that is usually asymptomatic and often detected incidentally during abdominal surgery. A 58-year-old female patient with a 13-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic steatohepatitis presented with recurrent biliary colic. Preoperative ultrasonography demonstrated a 1 cm gallstone, hepatomegaly (long axis 183 mm), and grade 2 hepatic steatosis. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, an accessory liver tissue attached to the gallbladder fundus by a pedicle was incidentally identified. The ectopic tissue was excised together with the gallbladder, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Although often asymptomatic, ectopic liver tissue carries a potential risk of malignant transformation. When encountered during cholecystectomy, it should be removed with meticulous attention to its vascular connection to avoid complications.",
