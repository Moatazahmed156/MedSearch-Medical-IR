    "abstract": "The phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning was discovered in 1986 in experiments with the heart, and then it was observed in almost all organs, the kidneys included. This phenomenon is underlain by conditioning of the tissues with short ischemia/reperfusion cycles intended for subsequent exposure to pathological ischemia. Despite the kidneys are not viewed as so vital organs as the brain or the heart, the acute ischemic injury to kidneys is a widespread pathology responsible for the yearly death of almost 2 million patients, while the number of patients with chronic kidney disease is estimated as hundreds of millions or nearly 10% adult population the world over. Currently, it is believed that adaptation of the kidneys to ischemia by preconditioning is the most effective way to prevent the development of acute kidney injury, so deep insight into its molecular mechanisms will be a launch pad for creating the nephroprotective therapy by elevating renal tolerance to oxygen deficiency. This review focuses on the key signaling pathways of kidney ischemic preconditioning, the potential pharmacological mimetics of its key elements, and the limitations of this therapeutic avenue associated with age-related decline of ischemic tolerance of the kidneys.",
