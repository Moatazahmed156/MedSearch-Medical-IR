    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Head and neck cancer (HNC) and its treatments can cause significant pain, which can profoundly impact patients' quality of life and treatment outcomes. Understanding the full scope of HNC pain is essential for effective management and improved patient care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This review aims to comprehensively analyze the multifaceted nature of pain experienced by individuals with HNC, including its various etiologies and management strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      HNC pain can arise from tumor extent, treatment-related toxicity, or comorbid conditions. The pathophysiology involves complex interactions between nociceptive, neuropathic, and inflammatory mechanisms. Optimal pain control requires a multimodal patient-tailored approach utilizing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Enhancing our understanding of HNC pain and optimizing its management is imperative for improving the overall well-being and treatment outcomes of affected individuals. Future research should focus on understanding detailed pain mechanisms, with the goal of developing personalized pain management strategies and exploring novel therapeutic targets. By implementing comprehensive approaches to HNC pain management, healthcare providers can better support patients through their cancer treatment journey.",
