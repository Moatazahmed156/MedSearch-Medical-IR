    "abstract": "Corticosteroid injections are used as a nonoperative modality to combat acute inflammation when conservative treatments fail. As female patients are regularly seen by orthopedic physicians, it is essential to identify and understand potential sex-related side effects. The aim of this article is to examine available literature for sex-related side effects of orthopedic-related corticosteroid injections. Although the incidence is low, sex-related side effects, such as abnormal menstruation, lactation disturbances, facial flushing, and hirsutism, are associated with corticosteroid injections. Physicians should be aware of these female-specific side effects and relay this information as part of the informed consent process. [Orthopedics. 2017; 40(2):e211-e215.].",
