  "title": "Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Cats: An Analysis of the Factors Involved.",
  "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is among the most frequent and clinically relevant metabolic disorders in cats, affecting a substantial proportion of the adult and geriatric feline population. The prevalence of CKD increases with age, being estimated at 20-50% in cats over 10 years of age. The etiology of this disorder involves genetic predisposition, dietary factors, as well as exposure to toxins or concomitant diseases that may accelerate the progression of renal lesions. The present study synthesizes data from the scientific literature together with clinical-epidemiological analyses performed on a cohort of 120 cats over a four-year period. The results highlighted an overall prevalence of CKD in the studied cohort, with a significantly higher frequency in cats over nine years of age, particularly affecting purebred animals. A slightly higher prevalence was observed in males compared to females, while reproductive status indicated an increased risk of CKD in neutered patients. Living environment and nutritional status were also influential, with a higher disease prevalence in indoor-only cats and in those fed nutritionally deficient diets. The multifactorial nature of CKD pathogenesis, combined with the nonspecific clinical manifestations in its early stages, explains the frequent late diagnosis of most cases. Consequently, an in-depth understanding of the epidemiology and associated risk factors constitutes an essential prerequisite for the development of preventive strategies, early screening protocols, and personalized therapeutic management aimed at optimizing quality of life and longevity in feline patients.",
