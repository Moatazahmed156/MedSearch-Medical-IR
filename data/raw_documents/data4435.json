    "abstract": "Breasts, including the nipple and areola, have two functions: lactation and as an erogenous area. Male breasts are much less studied that those of women. In men, breasts have only an erotic function. Because there is dense and very well organized innervation of the nipple-areola complex in men, nipple erection occurs frequently and via different mechanisms from penile erection. Although it seems to be less important for men than for women and it is poorly studied, the erotic value of breast stimulation is notable. Consequently, there is a need to include this aspect in sexological and andrological studies and to preserve breasts and their innervation or to reconstruct them in cases of surgical intervention.",
