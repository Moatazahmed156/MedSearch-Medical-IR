  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disorder involving pain and functional disturbance due to its impact on joint tissues. This study investigated the mechanism of the DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X)/NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway in pyroptosis and inflammatory responses in OA chondrocytes. Mouse chondrocyte ATDC5 cells were cultured in vitro and induced for chondrogenic differentiation, followed by H",
