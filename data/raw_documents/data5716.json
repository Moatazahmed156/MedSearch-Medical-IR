    "abstract": "A large number of microbial communities exist in normal human intestinal tracts, which maintain a relatively stable dynamic balance under certain conditions. Gut microbiota are closely connected with human health and the occurrence of tumors. The colonization of certain intestinal bacteria on specific sites, gut microbiota disturbance and intestinal immune disorders can induce the occurrence of tumors. Meanwhile, gut microbiota can also play a role in tumor therapy by participating in immune regulation, influencing the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs, targeted therapy of engineered probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation. This article reviews the role of gut microbiota in the occurrence, development, diagnosis and treatment of tumors. A better understanding of how gut microbiota affect tumors will help us find more therapies to treat the disease.",
