    "abstract": "Objectives: Psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics represent an important branch of care with good treatment results in Germany. So far, however, it is largely unclear which processes underlie the treatment successes. In the partial evaluations of the Hersfeld catamnesis study presented here, recourse is made to the construct of mentalizing ability, which has become very important in recent psychotherapy research. Methods: The mentalization ability of a large sample (N = 559) was assessed with the help of the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), and psychological and somatic complaints were assessed with HEALTH-PSB scale from HEALTH-49 at three points in time, namely at admission, at discharge and in a 6-month catamnesis. Results: Both the total score of the MZQ and all subscores show significant reductions in mentalization deficits in the small effect size range, the HEALTH-PSB in the high effect size range and the catamnesis in the medium effect size range. A regression analysis shows that the reduction in mentalization deficits has a high predictive power for symptom improvement. Conclusions: The results indicate that the construct of mentalization ability is a central target variable in psychosomatic rehabilitation.",
