  "title": "Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and the risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people with chronic kidney disease: results from the BRIGHTEN study.",
  "abstract": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, its clinical significance in CKD remains unclear. This study investigated the association between plasma MCP-1 levels and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. This multicenter, prospective, observational analysis used data from the BRIGHTEN study. Participants with anemia and CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m This study included 1,447 participants with advanced CKD (median eGFR 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m²). The group with the lowest MCP-1 level (< 324.5 pg/mL) had the highest baseline eGFR. In the univariable analyses, higher MCP-1 levels were associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (log-rank p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively), although these associations were not significant after multivariable adjustment. Analysis of the annual eGFR decline using a multivariable linear mixed-effects model revealed that higher MCP-1 levels were associated with an additional eGFR decline of approximately 1.0 mL/min/1.73 m In patients with CKD, higher plasma MCP-1 levels are associated with a more rapid decline in kidney function but not with the composite outcome of kidney failure. MCP-1 was not associated with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this population cohort.",
