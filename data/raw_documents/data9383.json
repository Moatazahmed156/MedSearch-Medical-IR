  "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is currently the most effective intervention for sustained weight loss and may reduce the risk of obesity-associated kidney disease. This study examined the relationships between MBS and adverse kidney outcomes. This retrospective cohort analysis included 4322 patients with obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), who underwent MBS, and 30,919 nonsurgical control patients from a large health system within the state of Indiana. A primary kidney composite [≥ 1 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 mL/min/1.73 m The mean (standard deviation) follow-up duration was 6.1 (4.5) years. MBS was associated with a 53% (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.52;  MBS was associated with markedly lower risks for adverse kidney outcomes in patients with obesity. These results support the potential for MBS as a weight loss intervention to preserve kidney function in patients with obesity, both with and without T2D.",
