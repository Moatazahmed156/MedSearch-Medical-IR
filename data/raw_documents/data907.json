    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual disability. Identifying fragile X syndrome at a young age can be quite challenging because the classical physical features usually present in late childhood or early adolescence; therefore, it is important to consider genetic testing for all males with unexplained developmental delays, intellectual disability, and autism, females with developmental delays, intellectual disability or autism, and a family history of fragile X gene disorders. There is no specific treatment to manage fragile X syndrome. Still, a prompt referral for early intervention is essential to help maximize the child's learning potential, as well as a referral to child psychology if any behavioral concerns are present. It is of paramount importance for families with a history of fragile X syndrome to have access to genetic counseling as it can aid in future reproductive decisions and the risk of future recurrences of this condition.
