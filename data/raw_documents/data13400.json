  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease, whose main characteristic is the death of dopaminergic neurons. The animal model of Parkinsonism with reserpine has been used to mimic the consequences of Parkinson's disease. The use of gold nanoparticles in the treatment of several diseases arises due to their evidence of promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Curcumin, in turn, presents neuroprotective activity in neurodegenerative diseases by reducing both inflammatory activity and oxidative stress in models of Parkinson's disease. This article seeks to understand the effects of the use of gold nanoparticles biosynthesized with curcumin in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease with reserpine. C57BL/6 mice were used, divided into five groups: I. Control; II. Parkinson's disease; III. Parkinson's disease + Gold nanoparticles; IV. Parkinson's disease + Curcumin; V. Parkinson's disease + Gold nanoparticles biosynthesized with curcumin. Mice were subjected to subcutaneous induction with reserpine, and treatments began 24 h after administration. Seven treatments were applied at 24-h intervals via the intranasal route. After the last treatment, behavioral tests were conducted, followed by euthanasia and removal of brain structures. The combined treatments demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects, reversing inflammatory and oxidative processes and partially reversing Parkinsonian behavior. Together, these therapies potentiated their effects, leading to near-complete reversal of reserpine-induced damage.",
