    "abstract": "Some South African (SA) healthcare practitioners are promoting the prescription and use of products claiming to contain ivermectin for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19 in SA. This study qualitatively analysed seven samples of ivermectin formulations (5 tablet and 2 capsule formulations) being sold in SA for human use. The samples were analysed using a high-performance liquid chromatography instrument connected to a Sciex X500R quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometer. The study found that all the samples had both the major homologues of ivermectin (B1a and B1b) and also that 4 out of the 5 tablet formulations tested had at least one additional undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient.",
