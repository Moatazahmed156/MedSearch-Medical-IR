    "abstract": "Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer has less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and less postoperative complications compared to laparotomies. Robotic technologic advantages over laparoscopic technique are most pronounced in obese patients. The shorter learning curve may explain the greater utilization of the robotic technique. Robotic surgery will continue as a mainstay in the treatment of uterine cancers as we become more efficient and cost conscious while maintaining the high quality outcomes that have been reported.",
