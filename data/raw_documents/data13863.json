  "title": "Long-term outcomes in seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the cumulative incidence of diagnosis switching, drug-free remission, and initiation of a biologic or targeted synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD) in individuals with seronegative RA. Adult residents of Olmsted County, MN with incident seronegative (rheumatoid factor-/anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody-) RA meeting the 1987 and/or 2010 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were included. Data were collected from 1/1/2005-12/31/2023 through manual chart review. Drug-free remission was defined as a period of ≥6 months where the individual was no longer on treatment for RA and did not have evidence of active inflammatory arthritis on evaluation by a rheumatologist. We calculated the 10-year cumulative incidence of a change in diagnosis, adjusting for the competing risk of death, and of drug-free remission and initiation of a b/tsDMARD, adjusting for the competing risks of death or change in diagnosis. A total of 176 individuals with seronegative RA (68% female) were included. The 10-year cumulative incidence of a change in diagnosis was 12.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-18.9%). The most common change in diagnosis was to a spondyloarthritis (4%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of drug-free remission and initiation of a b/tsDMARD was 26.6% (95% CI: 20.7-34.2%) and 19.9% (95% CI: 14.7-26.9%), respectively. Over a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 49 individuals entered drug-free remission. After initial diagnosis of seronegative RA, about 13% of individuals had a change in diagnosis and a quarter experienced drug-free remission within 10 years.",
