    "abstract": "Breast cancer screening by a combination of clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography is effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer in all age groups for years 40 and above. Mammography is the single most effective method in obtaining the mortality reductions. The CBE should not be omitted, however, in that it does add information not apparent on mammography. The CBE can be done safely by a nonphysician properly trained. Breast self-examination (BSE) is ineffectual in reducing mortality. It is debatable if it has a role in screening for breast cancer at all. This observer believes it should be done, in that its cost is minimal once the training is over.",
