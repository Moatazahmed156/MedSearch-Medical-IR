    "abstract": "Breast cancer, a heterogeneous and intricate disease, ranks among the leading causes of mortality in women. Restricted therapeutic choices, drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis are the predominant conditions that lead to mortality. Accumulating evidence has shown breast cancer initiation and progression happen through a multifaceted and intricate process that involves numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. The modulation of gene expression through epigenetic modifications, encompassing DNA methylation, histone alterations, and non-coding RNA regulation, has emerged as a fascinating field that represents a new avenue for breast cancer therapy. This review emphasizes various aberrant epigenetic regulations implicated in the onset and advancement of breast cancer. The critical epigenetic modifications closely associated with estrogen signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stemness, and drug resistance have been discussed extensively. Moreover, it highlights current epi-drugs, including DNA modifying agents, histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, histone methyltransferase inhibitors, and histone demethyltransferase inhibitors used for breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, we described current investigations pertaining to combination therapy employing epi-drugs and future challenges.",
