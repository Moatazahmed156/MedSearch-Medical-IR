  "title": "A rare case of involuting fibroadenoma in a young premenopausal female.",
  "abstract": "Fibroadenomas are prevalent among women in their teens and twenties, and while they generally present as palpable masses, their involution can present unique diagnostic and management challenges. The involution process is marked by a transition from a well-defined, hypercellular tumor to a more fibrotic and less cellular state, often leading to decreased size or complete resolution of the mass over time. This process of involution is typically seen with decreased estrogen which occurs after menopause. This case report presents a unique opportunity of following the progression of a biopsy proven fibroadenoma in a young premenopausal female without any medical or surgical history.",
  "disease": "breast cancer"
