    "abstract": "Many genes is plant mitochondria have been analyzed in the past 15 years and regulatory processes controlling gene expression can now be investigated. In vitro systems capable of initiating transcription faithfully at promoter sites have been developed for both monocot and dicot plants and will allow the identification of the interacting nucleic acid elements and proteins which specify and guide transcriptional activities. Mitochondrial activity, although required in all plant tissues, is capable of adapting to specific requirements by regulated gene expression. Investigation of the factors governing the quality and quantity of distinct RNAs will define the extent of interorganelle regulatory interference in mitochondrial gene expression.",
