  "title": "Surface-Engineered Ethambutol-Loaded Nanoparticles: Design, Fabrication, and In Vitro-In Vivo Evaluation for Tuberculosis Therapy.",
  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, aggravated by limitations of current chemotherapeutic regimens, including poor oral bioavailability, systemic side effects, and patient noncompliance. This study aimed to develop and evaluate macrophage-targeted, mannose-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles (Mn-ETB-SNs) for enhanced oral delivery of ethylbutol (ETB), a first-line anti-TB drug. The Mn-ETB SNs were fabricated using high-pressure homogenization followed by surface mannosylation through Schiff's base formation between mannose and amine-functionalized nanoparticles. The prepared formulations were characterized for particle size, ζ-potential, drug loading, entrapment efficiency, morphology, and stability. ",
