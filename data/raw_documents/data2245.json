    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment, is the most prevalent cause of dementia, and it poses a significant socioeconomic and caregiving burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Notwithstanding comprehensive research, the precise causes underlying AD remain ambiguous. Evidence increasingly indicates that AD is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease involving a mix of genetic and environmental factors. The amyloid-cascade hypothesis, neuroinflammation and immunity, vascular pathology, and oxidative stress all fulfill significant functions in the onset and development of AD. This review primarily examines the critical pathogenesis, key biomarkers, and novel therapeutic strategies of Alzheimer's disease to inform future research directions.",
