  "title": "The oncomicropeptide IADMP promotes lung cancer progression by stablilized RPS3A expression.",
  "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may encode functional micropeptides with diverse biological functions. Here, we identify a 79-amino acid micropeptide encoded by the human lncRNA IDH1-AS1, termed IDH1-AS1-derived micropeptide (IADMP). Functional assays demonstrate that IADMP enhances the malignant phenotypes of lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, IADMP interacts with and enhances the stability of RPS3A, a known driver of lung cancer progression. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized micropeptide axis involved in cancer biology and highlight IADMP as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",
