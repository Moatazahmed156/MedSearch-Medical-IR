  "abstract": "Background and aimsSevere pneumonia represents a serious threat to the health of elderly individuals. This study aims to exploratory analyse the effect of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and APACHE II scores for assessing the 28-day mortality risk in elderly patients with severe pneumonia.MethodsOur study enrolled 80 elderly patients with severe pneumonia (53 males and 27 females). The associations of NLR, oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), and acute physiology and chronic health score II (APACHE II) with 28-day mortality risk were assessed using multivariable logistic regression hazards model. The predictive value of BNP, NLR, and APACHE II scores for 28-day mortality risk in this patient population was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.ResultsBNP (odds ratio [OR], 1.007; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.002-1.012; ",
