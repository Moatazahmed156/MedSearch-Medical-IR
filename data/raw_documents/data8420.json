    "abstract": "Normal circadian rhythms are essential for organisms to adapt to diurnal changes and maintain an optimal state of physiological function. Disturbances in circadian rhythms such as shift work and working at night increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Myocardial infarction exhibits a marked circadian rhythm, usually peaking in the early morning. Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a transcription factor with a circadian rhythm, plays an important role in cardiac physiopathology. It has a protective effect against myocardial injury after myocardial infarction by regulating energy metabolism and inflammatory factors, among other pathways. Currently, the association between circadian rhythm, KLF15, and myocardial infarction is unclear, thus this paper reviews how circadian rhythm influences the role of KLF15 in myocardial infarction, aiming to reveal the association between circadian rhythm, KLF15, and myocardial infarction, and to explore the underlying mechanisms, to provide new theoretical insights and therapeutic strategies for the clinical treatment of myocardial infarction.",
