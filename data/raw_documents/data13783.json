  "abstract": "Since the late 19th century, the relationship between oral infections and systemic health has been widely debated. Recent advances in microbiome research suggest that oral microbial imbalance-dysbiosis-can contribute to systemic inflammatory and metabolic disorders. We propose that the term \"oral-systemic dysbiosis\" more accurately captures the complex interactions linking oral microbial disruption to systemic disease risk. This conceptual reframing moves beyond a purely infectious model toward a systems-based understanding of oral-body health connections. Furthermore, we hypothesize that oral administration of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)-grade probiotic ",
