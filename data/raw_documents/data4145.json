    "abstract": "People infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are at a higher risk of developing autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease. However, clinical studies have shown that, unlike bacterial infections, inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis is rarely triggered by viral infections. Generally, adult females have a higher incidence of rheumatoid arthritis compared to males (a female/male ratio of approximately 3:1). The secretion of female hormones is presumed to be deeply involved in the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, there is a definitive role of genetic factors in rheumatoid arthritis. Typically, rheumatoid arthritis is treated with steroids and antibody drugs, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibodies and anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibodies; however, although the symptoms of autoimmune diseases are alleviated by these drugs, the underlying pathology cannot be completely cured. Meanwhile, immunosuppressive treatment with steroids is effective against inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, the pathogenesis, symptoms, and pathological findings of inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis associated with COVID-19 are presumably different from those of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis. Since COVID-19-related autoimmune-like diseases, such as COVID-19-related inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis, have pathological conditions that are different from inherited autoimmune diseases, it is possible to establish treatments that aim at remission. Further pathological analyses of patients with post-COVID-19 inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis are essential to the development of treatments for this type of arthritis.",
