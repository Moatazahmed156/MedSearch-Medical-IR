    "abstract": "Efforts are under way to define the role of minimally invasive strategies for molecular monitoring and risk stratification in endometrial cancer. A recent publication aims to define the association between circulating tumor DNA level and disease stage in patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer and determine whether sequencing of longitudinal cell-free DNA samples can be used for disease monitoring and detection of progression or recurrence. These results accelerate the current knowledge of molecular follow-up in endometrial cancer. See related article by Ashley et al., p. 410.",
