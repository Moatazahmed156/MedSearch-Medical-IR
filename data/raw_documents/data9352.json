  "title": "Socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcome increase the risk of long-term cardiovascular disease: an analysis using the UK Biobank.",
  "abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and low socioeconomic status (SES) are both associated with an increased long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In this analysis, we evaluated whether the association between a history of APO and ASCVD risk varies across different SES groups. We conducted this analysis using data from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort including participants aged 40 years to 69 years recruited between 2006 and 2010, with ongoing follow-up. APOs included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, low birth weight (<2.5 kg), and stillbirth. At enrollment, SES was assessed using the following indicators: household income, education, employment, and Townsend Deprivation Score. The hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset ASCVD was analyzed according to history of APO and SES categories. Among 146,064 women, those with a history of APO had a higher risk of new-onset ASCVD and overall lower SES-including lower income, less education, higher unemployment, and greater deprivation-compared with those without APO (p<0.001). The increased ASCVD risk associated with APO history was significant only in the low SES group (adjusted HR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.36), but not in the high SES group (adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.55, p=not significant). We found that women with low SES were more vulnerable to the adverse effects of APO history, resulting in a greater increase in ASCVD risk. This study highlights the need for SES-tailored preventive policies to reduce long-term cardiovascular disease in women with a history of APO.",
