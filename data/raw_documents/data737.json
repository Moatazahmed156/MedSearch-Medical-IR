    "abstract": "In the aftermath of the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, the country was left with a collapsed health system and a huge burden of mental health problems to deal with. With only one psychiatrist at the time, a health ecosystem had to be reinvented to deal with these fragilities.
