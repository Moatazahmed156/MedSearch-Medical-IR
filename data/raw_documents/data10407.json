  "title": "Genetic Downregulation of Interleukin-6 Signaling, Coagulation Function, and Risk of Thromboembolic Disease.",
  "abstract": "Although genetic evidence supports IL-6 (interleukin-6) signaling inhibition as protective against atherosclerotic disease, its potential effects on thromboembolic outcomes are not well established. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the association of genetically proxied IL-6 signaling inhibition with venous thromboembolism, cardioembolic stroke, and coagulation cascade protein levels. IL-6 signaling inhibition was proxied using the rs2228145  Genetically proxied IL-6 signaling inhibition was associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.16-1.47],  These findings suggest that IL-6 signaling inhibition dysregulates coagulation homeostasis and increases venous thromboembolism risk. Further experimental, translational, and epidemiologic studies are warranted to delineate underlying mechanisms and to evaluate thromboembolic safety in pharmacologic IL-6 signaling inhibition.",
