    "abstract": "Gene therapy offers new and promising treatment for patients with hematological malignancies. Tumor cells--lymphoma cells, for example--are possible targets for gene therapy. In general, gene therapeutic approaches require efficient gene transfer into host cells and sufficient transgene expression. Although many methods of gene transfer into mammalian cells exist, most do not allow efficient DNA transfer into primary lymphocytes. In contrast to gene transfer into tumor cells and many other cell types, which can be successfully performed using a variety of methods, the efficient expression of foreign DNA in lymphoma cells presents unique problems and challenges, requiring a careful selection of the mode of gene transfer. In this review, we discuss the current strategies for gene therapy in the treatment of lymphoma. We also summarize the current gene transfer methods for lymphoma cells and efficiency of transgene expression.",
