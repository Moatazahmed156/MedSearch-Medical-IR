    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      There is paucity of literature on retroperitoneal haemorrhage/haematomas (RH) as these cases are extremely rare in obstetrics. Experience is available mostly from case reports and therefore the incidence of RH in obstetrics is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Literature search in Medline/Pubmed and Google scholar using MeSH; aneurysm, haematoma, haemorrhage, obstetrics and retroperitoneal.\n    \n\n\n          Aetiology and pathogenesis:\n        \n      \n      This article discusses aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic difficulties and dilemmas, as well as misleading symptoms that often mimic common clinical conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Diagnosis and management:\n        \n      \n      Management of RH is complex and continues to improve with advancements in the investigative strategies, treatment options and critical care specialty.
