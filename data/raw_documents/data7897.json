    "abstract": "Proteomics has long been considered an ideal platform, and urine an ideal source for biomarker discovery in human autoimmune kidney diseases. A number of studies have examined the urine proteome to identify biomarkers of disease activity, kidney pathology, and response to therapy. Increasingly, proteomic studies of kidney disease have expanded to include blood, circulating cells and kidney tissue. Recently the clinical potential of renal proteomics has been realized through a handful of investigations whose results appear to be applicable to patient care. In this review, approaches to the proteomic evaluation of autoimmune kidney diseases will be considered in the context of developing clinically useful disease biomarkers.",
