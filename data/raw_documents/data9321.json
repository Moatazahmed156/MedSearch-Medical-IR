  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit increasing comorbidity, yet the shared contribution of gut microbiota remains unclear. To investigate parallel microbial and functional alterations underlying PD, T2DM, and PD with diabetes (PDDM), we performed fecal metagenomic sequencing in 156 PD, 41 T2DM, and 44 PD with diabetes (PDDM) patients and 83 healthy controls (HC). PD and T2DM showed highly concordant microbial shifts, with 22 genera and 91 species consistently altered across disease groups compared with HC. Functional enrichment highlighted common perturbations in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, retinol metabolism, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, and xenobiotic degradation, implicating disrupted oxidative stress responses, neuro-metabolic regulation, and detoxification.
