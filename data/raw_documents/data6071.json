    "abstract": "The purpose of this descriptive study was to analyze physical therapists' clinical problem solving and compare the results with physicians' clinical problem solving. Ten skilled physical therapy clinicians were observed as they performed an initial interview with a patient. Their performance was audiotaped and later analyzed. The therapists defined their problem lists and developed treatment plans early in the interview, as they gathered data. This clinical problem-solving sequence is comparable to a method reported in the literature that is used by physicians. This model of clinical problem solving based on actual performance of clinicians can be used to train physical therapy students and, perhaps, to refine clinical evaluation skills.",
