  "abstract": "Ephrin type-B receptor 3 (EphB3) binds to transmembrane ephrin-B ligands to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. EphB3 exhibits a gradient expression pattern in the normal intestine, with the highest levels at the crypt base, and plays a crucial role in the maintenance of normal intestinal epithelium. Therefore, anti-EphB3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are required for basic research and diagnosis. In this study, we developed novel antihuman EphB3, Eb",
