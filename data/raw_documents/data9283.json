  "title": "Trimetazidine Ameliorates Progression of Diabetic Nephropathy by Reducing Serum Creatinine Level in Streptozotocin Induced Diabetic Rats.",
  "abstract": "Trimetazidine (TMZ) has anti-ischemic effects by increasing glutathione peroxidase and membrane damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also production of trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO) which causes cytoprotection and provides the renoprotective effect. This preclinical trial was conducted in Animal rat house of Pharmacology Department at BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh from 1st March to 31st 2017 for 30 days, this experimental study sixty-six (66) rats were divided into eight groups. Group I and II received no medication. Three groups (IIIa, IVa and Va) of rats were induced diabetic nephropathy by streptozotocin (STZ). Parallel to these groups, three combined treatment groups (IIIb, IVb and Vb) treated by trimetazidine concomitant with STZ. IIIa and IIIb were sacrificed on 22nd day to detect incidence of nephropathy, groups IVa and IVb were sacrificed on 43rd day to detect onset of nephropathy and groups Va and Vb were sacrificed on 57th day to detect progression of nephropathy. Biochemical indices like the status of oxidative stress were assessed by serum creatinine levels. In streptozotocin treated groups, serum creatinine was significantly (p<0.01) higher when compared to control. In TMZ treated group, whereas serum creatinine was significantly (p<0.01) lower when compared with STZ induced nephropathy groups of rats. It may be assumed from the present study that trimetazidine has cytoprotective as well as prevent renal damaged because of its special antioxidant effects, which can delay the onset, severity and progression of nephropathy induced by STZ in rats by reducing serum creatinine level.",
