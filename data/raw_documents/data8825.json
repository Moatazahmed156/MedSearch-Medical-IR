    "abstract": "Mortality rates for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remain high despite development of novel drugs and interventions over the past several decades. There is significant variability between hospitals in use of evidence-based treatments, and substantial opportunities exist to optimize care pathways and reduce disparities in care delivery. Quality improvement interventions implemented at local, regional, and national levels have improved care processes and patient outcomes. This article reviews evidence for quality improvement interventions along the spectrum of STEMI care, describes existing systems for quality measurement, and examines local and national policy interventions, with special attention to public reporting programs.",
