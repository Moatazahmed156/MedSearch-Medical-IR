  "abstract": "The investigation of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and inflammatory response associated with the different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) may reveal biomarkers of disease pathogenesis. Our goal was to identifying differences in the circulating miRNAs expression between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and non-dialytic (ND) patients and determine the regulatory miRNA-target gene networks and pathways potentially involved in disease pathogenesis. This was an exploratory cross-sectional study that included ND and PD patients with CKD stage 5 over 18 years of age. Inflammatory biomarkers and circulating miRNA expression profiles were evaluated. The study included 20 patients (57.2 ± 11.8 years). Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [0.37 (0.07-1.40) vs. 3.90 (2.50-5.79), p = 0.038] and interleukin-6 [3.35 ± 3.08 vs. 6.82 ± 4.08, p = 0.046] were significantly lower in the ND group in comparison to the PD group, respectively. Nine miRNAs were significantly deregulated (fold change (FC) ≥ 2 and p ≤ 0.05) in the PD compared to the ND group. Computational analyses showed a large number of target genes commonly regulated by at least two of the identified miRNAs. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, insulin secretion/resistance, and energy metabolism were among significant pathways regulated by miRNA target genes. Patients on PD treatment showed deregulated circulating levels of the 9 identified miRNAs and higher serum inflammatory biomarkers, compared to ND patients. Genes regulated by miRNAs are mainly associated with GPCR signaling, insulin resistance, and energy metabolism, playing roles in fibrosis and inflammatory-associated functions.",
