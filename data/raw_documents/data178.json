    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Elderly patients frequently experience poor sleep quality. We aimed to determine its prevalence and risk factors in diabetic elderly patients from Turkey.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An observational cross-sectional study of 220 diabetic elderly patients with a mean age of 70.4 ± 5.9 was conducted between June 2019 and December 2019. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used. Patients were divided based on sleep quality into poor (PSQI> 5) and good (PSQI≤ 5) sleep quality groups. Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Hendrich II Fall Risk Model were adopted. The prevalence of poor sleep quality and risk factors were evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Prevalence of poor sleep quality was 58.6%. Poor sleepers were significantly older, were more likely to be divorced, had more comorbidities, and used more medicines (ps<0.05). Longer duration of diabetes, higher incidence of hypoglycemic events, and diabetic complications were significantly associated with poor sleep quality (ps<0.05). Poor sleepers had higher levels of blood glucose and HbA1c levels (ps<0.05). PSQI was significantly correlated with age, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, higher depression, anxiety, and falling risk (ps<0.05). Severe depression, anxiety, and higher falling risk were independent risk factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Most patients experienced poor sleep quality. It was associated with a longer duration of diabetes, chronic diabetes-related complications, and higher HbA1c levels. Severe depression, anxiety, and higher falling risk were risk factors for poor sleep quality.",
