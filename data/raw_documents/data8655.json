    "abstract": "Yellow fever, a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever, is one of the most lethal diseases of humankind. The etiologic agent is the prototype member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, a group of small, enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses. Approximately one in seven people who become infected develop a rapidly progressive illness, with hepatitis, renal failure, hemorrhage and cardiovascular shock, with a case fatality rate of 20-50%. Yellow fever occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America, where it remains a continuing public health problem of varying magnitude, depending on the level of vaccination coverage in the human population and cyclical, ecologic and climatic factors that influence virus transmission.",
