    "abstract": "Tight junctions (TJs) are the most apical components of the cell-cell adhesion machinery in epithelial and endothelial cells and they play essential roles in homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed that aberrant expression of tight junction proteins (TJPs) is frequently observed in various type of cancers. Here we review cancer-associated aberrant expression of TJPs with focus on transmembrane-type TJPs including claudins, junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), and occludin. Some transmembrane-type TJPs are upregulated at the early neoplastic stage and their expression persists during dedifferentiation. Aberrant expression of TJPs contributes to proliferation, invasion, and dysregulated signaling of cancer cells. In addition to an increase in their expression level, their localization is altered from a TJ-restricted pattern to distribution throughout the whole cell membrane, making them suitable as therapeutic targets. Extracellular domains of transmembrane-type TJPs can be approached by target drugs not only from the lumen side (apical side) but also from the extracellular matrix side (basal side), including blood vessels. Aberrantly expressed TJPs are potential useful diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets for cancers.",
