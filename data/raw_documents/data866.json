    "abstract": "Tight junctions play an essential role in sealing tissues, by forming belts of adhesion strands around cellular perimeters. Recent work has shown that the condensation of ZO1 scaffold proteins is required for tight junction assembly. However, the mechanisms by which junctional condensates initiate at cell-cell contacts and elongate around cell perimeters remain unknown. Combining biochemical reconstitutions and live-cell imaging of MDCKII tissue, we found that tight junction belt formation is driven by adhesion receptor-mediated ZO1 surface condensation coupled to local actin polymerization. Adhesion receptor oligomerization provides the signal for surface binding and local condensation of ZO1 at the cell membrane. Condensation produces a molecular scaffold that selectively enriches junctional proteins. Finally, ZO1 condensates directly facilitate local actin polymerization and filament bundling, driving the elongation into a continuous tight junction belt. More broadly, our work identifies how cells couple surface condensation with cytoskeleton organization to assemble and structure adhesion complexes.",
