    "abstract": "Standard neuroleptic medications have been augmented by the introduction of risperidone and clozapine into clinical practice. A great deal of attention has also been focused on efficacy and the lower propensity to extrapyramidal side-effects associated with the new agents. However, antipsychotic medication, both old and new, can cause a range of other adverse effects, some of which are serious, and many of which have the potential greatly to diminish the quality of life of patients who need to take medication in the long term. Of particular significance are postural hypotension, cardiotoxicity, peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, sedation, weight gain, and endocrine and haematological effects. Various antipsychotic compounds differ substantially with regard to propensity to adverse effects. Side-effects can be minimized by optimization of clinical strategies, including choice of appropriate drug, slow titration and dosage reduction. It is also vital to explain carefully to both patients and carers the nature of the side-effects which can be anticipated. The choice of antipsychotic is often determined by evaluation of the potential impact of the various adverse effects on a particular patient. New drugs, such as risperidone, are well tolerated, with fewer side-effects, and should now be considered as a first-line option.",
