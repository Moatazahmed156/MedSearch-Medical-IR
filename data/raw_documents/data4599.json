    "abstract": "We present the case of a 69 years old man affected by Aarskog-Scott syndrome. He came to our attention for an aneurysm of the aortic root, with almost moderate aortic regurgitation; moderate mitral regurgitation was discovered during preoperative assessment. We performed a modified Bentall's procedure and mitral valve repair. A patent foramen ovale was closed. Aarskog-Scott syndrome is a complex developmental disorder, characterized by X-linked recessive hereditariness short stature, craniofacial abnormalities, hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal joints, and genital malformations. Diagnosis is still a challenge, in light of various clinical pictures and features in common with other syndromes (i.e., Noonan, SHORT, and Robinow syndromes). It has been longly debated if cardiac surveillance is needed among the affected patients; it should be probably undertaken, in view of the higher incidence of congenital heart disease. Moreover, the presence of extremely flexible joints suggests the coexistence of a connective tissue disorder.",
