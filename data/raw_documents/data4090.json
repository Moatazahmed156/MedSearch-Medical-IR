    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Osseous form is a rare manifestation of hydatid cystic disease, and it is easily misdiagnosed for other musculoskeletal infections and tumor-like lesions as it presents in a solitary form with subtle and unspecific radiological features and clinical symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      Our study is a case report of a young female patient with hydatid cyst in the distal femur, who was treated successfully with surgical resection, conducted in 2021 and the case was followed up for 8 months.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Several cases had been reported of osseous hydatidosis commonly in the axial skeleton and often diagnosed lately, stressing the importance of keeping unfamiliar diagnosis in mind when dealing with untypical lesions of bone.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Hydatid osseous is a rare parasitic disease that has a non-specific clinical and radiological presentation, differentiating it from similar looking tumor-like lesions and early diagnosis is not simple. However it is crucial as it requires precise treatment plan to prevent recurrence, and long term follow up is important.",
