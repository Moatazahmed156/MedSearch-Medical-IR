  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition marked by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation and significantly affects global health. The intricate relationship between COPD and the lung microbiome has garnered attention, with metagenomic analyses revealing critical insights into microbial community dynamics and their functional roles. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive metagenomic analysis comparing throat samples from COPD patients (",
