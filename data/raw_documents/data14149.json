  "abstract": "Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling, yet its molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of proteoglycan 4 ( Using high-resolution Visium HD spatial transcriptomics, we examined the spatial distribution of  Spatial transcriptomics revealed that  These findings highlight the region-specific and time-dependent function of ",
