  "title": "Interactive Effects of Telomere Length and Genetic Variants on Alzheimer Disease Risk Across Multiple Ancestral Populations.",
  "abstract": "Telomere length (TL), a biomarker of biological aging, but its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We estimated TL in whole-genome sequencing data from 35,014 Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project participants using TelSeq, which after quality control yielded a dataset including 6,973 persons of European ancestry (EA), 4,188 African Americans (AA), 4,005 Caribbean Hispanics (CH), and 4,170 Native American Hispanics (NAH). TL was log-transformed, adjusted for age and blood cell counts, and z-scaled. Scaled TL was dichotomized into long and short groups according to the median. An AD GWAS for the interaction of TL with variants having a minor allele count >20 was performed in each ancestry group using logistic regression models including SNP and TL main effects and a SNP×TL interaction term. AD risk was associated with shorter TL (β = -0.18,  We identified variants that significantly impact AD risk through their interaction with TL, suggesting that TL maintenance pathways may be central to AD pathogenesis.",
