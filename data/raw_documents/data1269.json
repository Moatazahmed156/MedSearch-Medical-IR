    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent rhythm disturbance that raises the possibility of heart failure (HF) and stroke. AF is a multifactorial disorder combining genetic and environmental etiologies. Over the last decade, advancements have been made regarding the genetic base of this arrhythmia. We present the existing knowledge of genetic analysis and genome editing for atrial fibrillation, indicating the existing gaps and future directions. We aim to elucidate how genome editing could be utilized for patients with atrial fibrillation.",
