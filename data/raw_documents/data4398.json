    "abstract": "With the rapid development of nanotechnology, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNPs) are widely used in many fields. People in such workplaces or researchers in laboratories are at a higher risk of being exposed to TNPs, so are the consumers. Moreover, increasing evidence revealed that the concentrations of TNPs are elevated in animal organs after systematic exposure and such accumulated TNPs could induce organ dysfunction. Although cellular responses such as oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, autophagy, signaling pathways, and genotoxic effects contribute to the toxicity of TNPs, the interrelationship among them remains obscure. Given the pivotal role of oxidative stress, we summarized relevant articles covering the involvement of oxidative stress in TNPs' toxicity and found that TNP-induced oxidative stress might play a central role in toxic mechanisms. However, available data are far from being conclusive and more investigations should be performed to further confirm whether the toxicity of TNPs might be attributed in part to the cascades of oxidative stress. Tackling this uncertain issue may help us to comprehensively understand the interrelationship among toxic cellular responses induced by TNPs and might shed some light on methods to alleviate toxicity of TNPs.",
