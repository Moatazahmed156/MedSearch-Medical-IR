  "abstract": "Concomitant administration of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and influenza vaccination schedules has been widely adopted. However, long-term data on the immunological impact, particularly on variant-specific responses, remain limited. In this 10-month prospective study, 80 participants (40 per group) received either a concomitant bivalent COVID-19 mRNA booster and quadrivalent influenza vaccination (Group C) or separate vaccinations (Group S) at least 4 weeks apart. Immunogenicity was evaluated using an anti-S IgG electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, anti- receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT), and hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Both Groups C and S elicited robust immune responses for up to 10 months with no immune interference, as antibody responses against wild-type (WT) and Omicron BA.5 remained comparable between the groups. Notably, neutralising antibody titre against Omicron BA.5 were higher in Group C at 1 month post-vaccination, with significantly higher neutralising potency (FRNT",
