  "title": "Antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination and breakthrough infections in naïve and convalescent individuals suggest imprinting to the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2.",
  "abstract": "The binding and neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are important correlates of protection of current COVID-19 vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 exposure status and COVID-19 vaccine types can influence these responses and the breadth of cross-reactivity to variants. In this longitudinal cohort study, we used SARS-CoV-2-specific multiplex Luminex antibody assays and live virus neutralization of ancestral (VIC01/2020), Delta and Omicron (BA1, BA2, and BA5) SARS-CoV-2 variants to compare antigen-specific binding, and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to primary vaccination (two doses) of adenovirus vectored (AdVV) or mRNA vaccines followed by a booster dose of mRNA vaccine in convalescent (",
