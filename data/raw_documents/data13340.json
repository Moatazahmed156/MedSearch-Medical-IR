  "title": "Isolated REM sleep without atonia and isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: a study of clinical and prognostic differences.",
  "abstract": "Isolated REM sleep without atonia (iRSWA) is increasingly detected on polysomnography (PSG), yet its clinical relevance remains unclear. We compared the demographic profile, sleep physiology, comorbidities, and longitudinal outcomes of people with iRSWA and isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD). We retrospectively reviewed PSG reports (2008-2022) from a tertiary sleep-medicine center, classifying people as iRSWA or iRBD based on self-reported dream-enactment behavior. Clinical data were extracted from charts, and PSG variables from sleep reports. Neurological and psychiatric diagnoses before the sleep examination were obtained from national registries. Comparisons used multivariable regression and Fine-Gray competing-risk models. The cohort comprised 302 participants (iRSWA = 98 and iRBD = 204). Participants with iRSWA were more often female (38.8% vs 23%,  iRSWA differs from iRBD in profile and pre-index comorbidity patterns. Our findings support the view that iRSWA may reflect mechanisms other than a uniform prodromal stage of α-synucleinopathy.",
