    "abstract": "Aims:\n        \n      \n      Smoking and human papillomavirus (HPV) are both distinct risk factors for head and neck cancer, but the nature of interaction between these 2 risk factors in the development of head and neck cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this review is to determine the potential effect of smoking in causation of HPV-related head and neck carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A literature search was carried out using the keywords human papillomavirus, head and neck cancer, smoking, tobacco, and cervical cancer. The English-language articles, references, and other relevant studies evaluating the association of smoking, HPV, and risk of head and neck cancer were collected and analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overall, our review points to smoking tobacco posing an additional risk for development of head and neck cancer in the presence of HPV infection. This is consistent with available laboratory data that show evidence of biological plausibility for interaction between smoking and progression of HPV infection to carcinogenesis. It is therefore important that cessation of smoking is promoted in smokers with HPV infection.",
