  "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains the gold-standard treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis, yet persistent challenges in prosthetic material performance limit its long-term clinical efficacy. CoCrMo alloy is commonly used material of femoral component in TKA due to its excellent mechanical durability. However, two critical limitations persist: (1) substantial elastic modulus mismatch inducing stress-shielding effects, and (2) bioinert surface impairing osseointegration. To address these dual challenges, we developed a synergistic surface engineering strategy combining 3D-printed porous architecture with Mg",
