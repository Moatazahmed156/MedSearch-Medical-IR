    "abstract": "With the widespread use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the optimal management strategy for axillary lymph nodes following chemotherapy has become a hot topic of discussion. For patients with clinically positive axillary lymph nodes (cN +) (defined as axillary lymph nodes confirmed positive by pathology before NAC), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains the current standard treatment. However, there is still no consensus on whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and other local axillary treatments following NAC can safely replace ALND to reduce injury and complications. This article provides a narrative review of strategies for managing axillary lymph nodes in this patient population.",
