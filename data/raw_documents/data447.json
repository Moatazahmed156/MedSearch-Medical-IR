    "abstract": "Older adults account for 25% of first-time seizures, with many of these seizures caused by accumulated injuries and insults to the brain and comorbidities associated with aging or as a result of a life-threatening comorbidity, yet seizures in older adults are often so subtle that they are not recognized or treated. Once an older adult has 1 seizure, they are at higher risk of more seizures and ultimately a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy affects quality of life and safety and may jeopardize life itself in the older adult; thus, it is important to be able to recognize seizures in older adults and know what to do.",
