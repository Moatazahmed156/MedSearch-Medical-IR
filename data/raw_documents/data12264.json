  "abstract": "Zwitterionic heterocycles hold significant therapeutic potential; however, their application is often hindered by poor membrane permeability and limited target-cell selectivity. Here, we report an innovative strategy for the in situ synthesis of these compounds within cancer cells, using a rationally designed precursor that is nontoxic, non-ionic, and membrane permeable. The synthesis is initiated by endogenous acrolein, an oncometabolite elevated in cancer cells, which triggers a cascade involving 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, diazo formation, carbamate cleavage, imine formation, intramolecular 6π-azaelectrocyclization, oxidative aromatization, and ester hydrolysis. We validated this methodology in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, where the in situ-synthesized zwitterionic heterocycle exhibited anticancer activity. Conversely, its pre-synthesized congener showed minimal cytotoxicity, underscoring the poor membrane permeability of the zwitterionic form. Precursor optimization resulted in a lead compound that, upon administration to A549 cells, converted into a cytotoxic zwitterionic heterocycle with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC",
