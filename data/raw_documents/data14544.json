  "title": "The role of gut microbiome in aging-associated diseases: where do we stand now and how technology will transform the future.",
  "abstract": "The gut microbiome has emerged as a critical regulator of human aging and healthspan, with age-related dysbiosis increasingly implicated in a broad spectrum of aging-associated diseases. This review synthesizes evidence linking gut microbial alterations to infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, cancer, metabolic, kidney, cardiovascular, bone, and muscular diseases, highlighting shared mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolite imbalance. We further explore how enabling technologies, including functional multi-omics, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence-driven analytics, biobanking, and autologous fecal microbiota transplantation, are revolutionizing microbiome research and the design of interventions. Ethical considerations surrounding microbiome-based therapies are also addressed. To translate these scientific insights into clinical innovations, we formulate the PRIME framework: a five-phase roadmap encompassing ",
