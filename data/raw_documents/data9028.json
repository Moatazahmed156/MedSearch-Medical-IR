    "abstract": "Color is a crucial sensory attribute that guides consumer expectations. A high-performance pequi carotenoid extraction process was developed using ionic liquid-based ethanolic solutions and a factorial design strategy to search for a potential substitute for the artificial azo dye yellow tartrazine. All-trans-antheraxanthin was identified with HPLC-PAD-MSn for the first time in pequi samples. [BMIM][BF4] was the most efficient ionic liquid, and the maximization process condition was the solid-liquid ratio R(S/L) of 1:3, the co-solvent ratio R(IL/E) of 1:1 ([BMIM][BF4]: ethanol), and three cycles of extraction with 300 s each and yielded 107.90 μg carotenoids/g of dry matter. The ionic liquid-ethanolic solution recyclability was accomplished by freezing and precipitating with an average recovery of 79 %. In CIELAB parameters, pequi carotenoid extracted with [BMIM][BF4] was brighter and yellower than the artificial azo dye yellow tartrazine. A color change of 11.08 and a hue* difference of 1.26° were obtained. Furthermore, carotenoids extracted with [BMIM][BF4] showed antioxidant activity of 35.84 μmol of α-tocopherol. These findings suggest the potential of employing the pequi carotenoids to replace the artificial azo dye yellow tartrazine in foods for improved functional properties.",
