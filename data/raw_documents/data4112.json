    "abstract": "In this case report, we encountered a pseudocyst as a complication of endoscopic lumbar discectomy in a high-level athlete within 3 months, which is atypical according to the literature.

This case report outlines a review of the patient's clinical report, imaging, operative procedure, and complications, together with a literature review on pseudocysts after endoscopic lumbar discectomy.",
