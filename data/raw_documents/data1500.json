    "abstract": "Heart failure is a progressive condition that continues to increase in both incidence and prevalence despite pharmacologic treatment. The high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with advanced heart failure has led to exploration of additional treatments, which include surgical interventions to improve outcomes. Heart transplant remains the gold standard but, because of the persistent donor shortage and increasing number of patients with advanced heart failure, mechanical circulatory support is gaining acceptance and can be used as a bridge to heart transplant for those eligible or as destination therapy.",
