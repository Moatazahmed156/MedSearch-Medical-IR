    "abstract": "Risk factors for osteoporosis based on literally analysis were reviewed. For the prevention for the incidence of osteoporosis, the risk factors were low BMI, smoking and low impact exercise. Calcium and Vitamin D intake was the important preventive factor for the disease. Risk factors to assess the prevalent osteoporosis early were also reviewed. Finally, risk assessment for osteoporosis integrated by members of WHO collaborating centre for metabolic bone diseases were stated. They have undertaken a series of meta-analyses to identify clinical risk factors for fracture to determine their dependence upon age and sex. These were based on the individual data from prospective population-based studies. They concluded the risk factors for osteoporosis were age female-sex, low BMI, family history of fracture, current smoking, ever use of systemic corticosteroids, alcohol intake more than two units per day, rheumatoid arthritis and low BMD at the femoral neck or total hip.",
