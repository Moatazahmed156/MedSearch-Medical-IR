  "title": "Molecular Testing in Organ Biopsies and Perfusion Fluid Samples from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Positive Donors.",
  "abstract": "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2-positive donors were not considered eligible for organ donation. The Italian National Transplant Centre has gradually introduced measures to prevent donor-to-recipient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through organ transplantation. The current national screening protocol for deceased SARS-CoV-2-positive donors recommends molecular testing of donor lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples, graft biopsies and organ perfusion fluids. The aim of the study is to describe the 3-year experience of protocol application in a northern region of Italy. From 1 January 2022 to 31 January 2025, a total of 132 samples were analyzed (29 liver biopsies, 35 kidney biopsies, 68 perfusion fluids) from 40 organ donors with an active or resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 PCR on LRT samples was positive in 26/40 (65%) donors, negative in 11/40 (27.5%) cases and in the remaining 3 (7.5%) the PCR result was unknown. Overall, 65 organs were transplanted into 60 recipients. All processed graft biopsies and organ perfusion fluid samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data suggest that the utilization of non-lung donors with resolved or active SARS-CoV-2 infections who died of other causes appears justified and safe.",
