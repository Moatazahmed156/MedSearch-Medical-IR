  "title": "From antinuclear antibody testing to undifferentiated connective tissue disease diagnosis: a three-year median follow-up of 119 patients.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the progression rate of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) to defined CTDs by applying two sets of UCTD criteria alongside the most recent CTD classification criteria. A retrospective review was conducted on 1342 patients who underwent antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing at a rheumatology outpatient clinic between February 2021 and February 2023. UCTD was defined in patients exhibiting autoimmune features without meeting criteria for a specific CTD. Patients were categorized into two groups: (1) ANA-positive with disease duration ≥3 years (Mosca) and (2) positive finding for at least one of the following serological markers (ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-scl 70, SS-A or SS-B, Jo-1 antibody, sedimentation rate (two times normal), C-reactive protein) in the absence of infection, regardless of disease duration (Kinder). A total of 119 patients with UCTD (95% women) were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 34.1 (IQR: 21.4-52.7) months. Sixteen patients (13%) progressed to defined CTDs or rheumatoid arthritis (RA): primary Sjögren's syndrome ( Application of the most recent CTD classification criteria revealed a 13% progression rate from UCTD to defined CTDs or RA during a three-year median follow-up. In patients with suspected CTD, evaluation of serological markers beyond ANA may contribute to the diagnosis of UCTD. The establishment of standardized definitions for UCTD is essential to improve the methodological consistency of future studies and to facilitate more accurate prognostic assessments.",
