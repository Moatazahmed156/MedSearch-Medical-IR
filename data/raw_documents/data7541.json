    "abstract": "The role of operative therapy in stage IV breast cancer continues to evolve with advances in therapy and improvements in survival among this population. Traditionally surgery was performed with palliative intent to alleviate symptoms related to the intact breast primary. Several retrospective studies have challenged this paradigm, demonstrating survival advantage with surgery in de novo metastatic disease. Prospective studies are ongoing and maturing data. A comprehensive approach to local therapy following systemic therapy may be beneficial to achieve improved survival outcome associated with stage IV- no evidence of disease and to decrease local failure in inflammatory breast cancer.",
