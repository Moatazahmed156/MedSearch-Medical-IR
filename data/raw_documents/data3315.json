    "abstract": "A 5 day old girl was transferred to the pediatric ward of Kyushu University Hospital because of papules noted since birth. The papules were distributed on her skin corresponding to the dermatomes innervated by the left Th1-Th3 and the left L1-L3. Varicella-zoster virus antigens were detected in scrapings of incised papules. The diagnosis of herpes zoster was made and acyclovir (ACV) was administered. She responded to ACV well, but she experienced a recurrence twice after discontinuation of ACV. This is the first report of 'congenital herpes zoster', which supports the hypothesis that varicella embryopathy is the sequelae of herpes zoster in utero.",
