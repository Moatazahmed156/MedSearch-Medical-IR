    "abstract": "Family involvement in newborn intensive care quality improvement dates back to the 1980s. In recent years, there has been an evolution of support for family partnerships at the bedside, transforming parents from being passively present to being active and engaged caregivers and team members. Through those same efforts, a transformational understanding of the power of the family perspective in system design and improvement has occurred. Even with the progression and deepening of this involvement, opportunities exist to learn from families and to improve the quality of neonatal care as a result of the unique family perspective.",
