  "title": "Second Episode of Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition resulting from skeletal muscle breakdown, leading to the release of intracellular contents-most notably myoglobin-into the bloodstream. The accumulation of myoglobin can result in acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances. Common etiologies include trauma, strenuous physical activity, infections, genetic predisposition, and certain medications. Clinically, patients may present with muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, dark-colored urine, and decreased urine output. Creatine kinase, an enzyme predominantly located in skeletal muscle, serves as a highly sensitive marker for muscle injury and is a key diagnostic indicator of rhabdomyolysis.",
