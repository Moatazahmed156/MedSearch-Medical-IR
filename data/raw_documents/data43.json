    "abstract": "In the past, it was thought that physical rest was relevant for recovery of patients with prostate cancer; however, more recently there has been a paradigm shift towards physical activity parallel to oncological treatment. Diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer are associated with limitations at various levels and side effects [9], which in the course of therapy can be a potentially therapy-limiting factor associated with dose reduction, delay or even discontinuation of therapy with negative consequences for outcome and median survival. The current study situation on the topic of physical activity in prostate cancer includes various studies with differentiated physical activity interventions and treatment time points. The studies measured physiological and psychological parameters such as physical performance, incontinence, quality of life, and fatigue. Further studies also show a positive influence of exercise therapy on the prevention of long-term complications [11, 14-16]. Various international guidelines recommend physical activity during ongoing oncological therapy [5].",
