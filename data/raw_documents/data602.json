    "abstract": "Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are indolent subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both are typically CD5 and CD10 negative. In recent years, there have been several scientific advances that have helped improve the diagnosis of these conditions. These conditions have been managed similarly in previous years with observation in asymptomatic patients and systemic therapy in advanced stages. However, there are specific differences. Differential responses are also seen with novel agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. It is encouraging to see that there several clinical trials specific for patients with LPL and MZL ongoing.",
