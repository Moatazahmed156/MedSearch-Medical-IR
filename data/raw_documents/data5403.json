    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is currently one of the most common malignant tumors in females with poor survival rates around the world, killing about 200,000 women each year. Although great progress has been made in treatment, most patients receiving first-line therapy experience tumor recurrence. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in regulating the progression and prognosis of ovarian cancer. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells are the main cell population in the tumor microenvironment, which affect the progression, prognosis and chemical resistance of ovarian cancer. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells can also interact with other microenvironmental components, such as exosomes, macrophages, and adipocytes. Some studies have developed drugs targeting cancer-associated mesothelial cells in ovarian cancer to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency. In this review we highlighted the key role of cancer-associated mesothelial cells in the progression and prognosis of ovarian cancer. We also described the progress of cancer-associated mesothelial cells targeted therapy for ovarian cancer. Continued insight into the role of cancer-associated mesothelial cells in ovarian cancer will potentially contribute to the development of new and effective therapeutic regiments.",
