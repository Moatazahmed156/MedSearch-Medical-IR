  "title": "Stage-specific association of urinary C-megalin with diabetic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study in type 2 diabetes.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate urinary C-megalin in relation to disease staging and diagnostic accuracy in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this cross-sectional study, 325 participants were classified into No-DKD, early-DKD, and late-DKD based on kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Urinary C-megalin was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as absolute and creatinine-normalized values. Group comparisons, correlation analyses, and multinomial logistic regression were performed to assess associations with disease stage. Creatinine-normalized C-megalin excretion was higher in early-DKD compared with No-DKD (median 125.0 vs. 92.0 ng/mg Cr;  Urinary C-megalin demonstrates stage-dependent diagnostic behavior in DKD, suggesting potential as a complementary marker for early tubular injury and advanced disease in high-risk diabetic populations.",
