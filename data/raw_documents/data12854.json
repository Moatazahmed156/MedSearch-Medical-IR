  "title": "Neuropeptide Y at the crossroads of neurodegeneration: Mechanistic insights and emerging therapeutic strategies.",
  "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a widely distributed and highly conserved neuropeptide, plays a central role in the regulation of diverse physiological processes, including stress responses, energy homeostasis, vascular tone, and immune modulation, via activation of its receptor subtypes. Beyond its physiological roles, the dysregulation of NPY expression has been documented in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Machado-Joseph disease, and retinal disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. These alterations in NPY levels and receptor activity highlight its potential not only as a biomarker for disease progression but also as a promising therapeutic target. Previous evidence revealed that NPY exerts neuroprotection by alleviating excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation while concurrently facilitating neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cellular resilience. NPY activates receptor-mediated intracellular signaling cascades like PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and p38K, that control cellular survival, proteostasis, and inflammation and thereby influence disease trajectories. Understanding NPY operation with these mechanisms can unveil new avenues for targeted therapy. Current insights into the complex roles of NPY in neurodegeneration are discussed in this review, and their implications in diagnostic and treatment strategies are addressed.",
