    "abstract": "Wilms' tumor is childhood's most common renal tumor, and its presentation in the adult age is extremely rare. Due to the low frequency in adults, no standard management guidelines are available for this population, also the natural history of the disease and management is unclear. We present a case report of a 31-year-old woman with metastatic Wilms' tumor, with lymph node, lung and liver involvement; systemic treatment with chemotherapy was started, with complete clinical response. Finally, a literature review is performed to showcase the differences in the clinical course, prognosis, and treatment alternatives, in adult disease compared to childhood.",
