    "abstract": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), or histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare, benign, and self-limiting condition characterized by subacute necrotizing cervical lymphadenopathy. Diagnosed through excisional lymph node biopsy, KFD predominantly affects young adults, especially females, with a higher incidence in Asian populations. The case discussed involves a 17-year-old male from Nayarit, Mexico, presenting with recurrent cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to antibiotics. Physical examination and imaging suggested lymphoproliferative disease, while biopsy confirmed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68 positivity. KFD’s aetiology is unclear, with infectious and autoimmune theories proposed. The disease commonly resolves within 4 to 6 months with symptomatic management, including antipyretics and analgesics. This case is notable due to the patient’s young age, large lesion size, and male gender, diverging from the typical presentation, underscoring the importance of considering KFD as a differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.",
