    "abstract": "Management of pain after spinal cord injury remains a difficult clinical problem. In particular, neuropathic spinal cord injury pain, like other forms of deafferentation pain in which there is loss or modification of normal afferent sensory inputs, is notoriously resistant to currently available modes of treatment. Although there have been some advances in our understanding of spinal cord injury pain, the mechanisms of neuropathic spinal cord injury pain remain largely unknown and treatment is often ineffective. This review presents findings from recent publications that deal with the mechanisms and management of spinal cord injury pain.",
