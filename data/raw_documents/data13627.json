  "title": "Kynurenic Acid Analog Attenuates the Production of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, Calgranulins (S100A 8/9 and S100A 12), and the Secretion of HNP1-3, and Stimulates the Production of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Stimulated Gene-6 (TSG-6) but Does Not Alter IL-17 Levels in Whole-Blood Cultures of Patients with Spondyloarthritis.",
  "abstract": "Kynurenic acid (KYNA) has recognized anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Previous studies demonstrated that KYNA reduces TNF-α, S100A12, S100A8/9, and α-defensin production while increasing tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) levels in rheumatoid arthritis. This study evaluated a synthetic KYNA analog's effects on TNF-α, S100A8/9, S100A12, α-defensin, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) production and TSG-6 expression in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 54 AS and 38 PsA patients and 11 healthy controls were stimulated with heat-inactivated ",
