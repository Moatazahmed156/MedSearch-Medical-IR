    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a novel kind of regulated cell death distinct from autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis; it is predominantly caused by the iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. According to studies, numerous conventional signaling pathways and biological processes are implicated in the process of ferroptosis. In recent years, researchers have shown that ferroptosis plays an important role in the genesis, development, and metastasis of malignancies, including ovarian cancer. Several studies have revealed that ferroptosis has synergistic effects with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in inhibiting the growth of ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that ferroptosis is important in ovarian cancer treatment and may be a new target. In this review, we summarize the features of ferroptosis, including its underlying basis and function in ovarian cancer, as well as its potential applications in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",
