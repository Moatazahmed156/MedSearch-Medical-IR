    "abstract": "Urinary tract infections are common clinical entities occurring in a variety of patient groups, most frequently caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Novel methods of preventing UTI currently under development are focused on three key approaches: (1) use of cranberry products, (2) restoration of the normal flora using Lactobacillus-based probiotic preparations, and (3) vaccine development. Although promising studies in each of these areas have been published or are ongoing, additional properly designed and powered clinical studies based on solid scientific evidence are needed.",
