    "abstract": "Purpose of the review:\n        \n      \n      In the United States, spinal cord injuries affect approximately 18,000 individuals annually, most commonly resulting from mechanical trauma. The consequent paraplegia severely impairs motor functions, creating an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies that extend beyond traditional rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy. This review assesses the effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) in improving motor function in patients with spinal cord injuries, with a particular focus on paraplegia. SCS, an emerging intervention, has gained attention for its ability to activate paralyzed muscles and enhance the effects of physical therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Our review demonstrates that SCS can lead to significant functional improvements when optimally combined with rehabilitation strategies. The success of SCS depends largely on the precise placement of electrodes with individualized parameters and the integration of stimulation with intensive physical training. This review underscores the considerable potential of SCS to improve motor outcomes in individuals with paraplegia caused by spinal cord injury, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize SCS parameters, electrode placement, and its integration with rehabilitation protocols. This review highlights the potential of SCS as a therapeutic intervention for improving motor function in individuals with paraplegia caused by spinal cord injuries.",
