  "title": "Diminishing activities of daily living as severity of chronic breathlessness worsens: a national, cross-sectional survey.",
  "abstract": "Effective management of chronic breathlessness requires understanding people's activity limitations. This study evaluated the extent to which chronic breathlessness limits people's self-reported everyday activities. A web-based, cross-sectional survey (adults ≥18 years). Recruitment was through a marketing research company, stratified to the 2016 Australian Census for key demographics (age, sex, state/territory of residence, rurality). Self-reported measures included demographics, breathlessness limiting exertion (modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale) and breathlessness impact (yes/no question; three most important activities affected). Impact was categorised as performing with difficulty/reduced/ceased. 7300 respondents were included (mean age 46.5 (SD 18.6); men 50.8%; mMRC ≥1 290.0%). 30.6% (648/2119) with mMRC ≥1 versus 2.6% (136/5181; p<0.001) with mMRC 0 reported activities affected; the proportions increased for each mMRC level.2342 activities were nominated with the most frequent being: high intensity sport, household chores and mobility. The order changed for mMRC 2 (household chores>high intensity sports>mobility) and mMRC 3-4 (mobility>household chores>high intensity sports). Breathlessness increased the likelihood of activities being reduced or ceased.In a logistic regression model exploring the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule, controlling for baseline factors, most affected domains were getting along (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 4.2)), life activities (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.7)) and participation (OR 6.4 (95% CI 4.2 to 9.9)). Chronic breathlessness of every intensity above mMRC 0 affects people's ability to perform a range of everyday activities. The progressive loss of these activities is a key coping mechanism to avoid precipitating breathlessness and is mostly invisible to other people.",
