  "abstract": "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction, most commonly reported in young, otherwise healthy individuals. Although recent studies from the United States have identified a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B07:02 and C07:02 alleles, no cases have been reported in East Asian populations. A 37-year-old Korean male with rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease developed rapidly progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia after receiving TMP-SMX for Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction positivity. The patient was diagnosed with TMP-SMX-induced ARDS. Surgical lung biopsy demonstrated diffuse alveolar injury with delayed epithelialization. HLA genotyping confirmed the absence of HLA-B07:02 and C07:02 alleles. TMP-SMX was discontinued, and the patient received maximal supportive therapy, including corticosteroids, mechanical ventilation, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Despite aggressive management, the patient required prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and was transferred for lung transplantation evaluation due to persistent severe respiratory failure. This case represents the first reported TMP-SMX-induced ARDS with diffuse alveolar injury with delayed epithelialization pathology in an East Asian individual, suggesting ethnic variability in HLA-associated risk alleles. The findings underscore the need for population-specific pharmacogenomic investigation in severe drug-induced lung injury.",
