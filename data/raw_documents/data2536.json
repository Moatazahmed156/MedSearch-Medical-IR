    "abstract": "There is evidence that nutritional impairment can complicate juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). It is also recognized that the JIA drug treatment may affect the nutritional aspects of patients. It is crucial to understand the impacts that nutritional aspects can have on a patient's treatment, health, and life. Therefore, this review explores how nutrition influences juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Dietary aspects play essential roles in JIA patients' growth, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), inflammation, and recovery. Suboptimal nutrition seems to adversely affect the long-term outcome of JIA patients. Nutritional deficiency potentially affects JIA patients' general wellbeing and disease control and contributes to growth, inflammation, BMI, and BMD disturbances. It was also possible to verify that the correct status of nutrients helps the body recover and reduce inflammation in JIA patients, since nutritional status and nutrients play an important role in regulating immune function. Studies are diverse, and most analyze the effects of a single nutrient on JIA. Moreover, the diet and nutrition impacts are difficult to interpret in the pediatric population due to family influence, dietary regulation, and data collection in children/adolescents. Despite the lack of standardization among studies, the potential benefits of a healthy diet on short- and long-term health and wellbeing in JIA patients are noteworthy.",
