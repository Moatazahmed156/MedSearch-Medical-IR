    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this paper is to advance healthcare service quality research using hierarchical component models.\n    \n\n\n          Design/methodology/approach:\n        \n      \n      This study used a quantitative approach with cross-sectional design as a survey method, combining cluster and convenience sampling and partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to validate the research model and test the hypotheses.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The study extends health service quality literature by showing that: patient satisfaction (PS) is dominant, significant and indirect determinant of behavioural compliance (BC); perceived service quality has the strongest effect on BC via PS.\n    \n\n\n          Research limitations/implications:\n        \n      \n      Only one hospital was evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Practical implications:\n        \n      \n      The study provides managers with a service quality model for conducting integrated service delivery systems analysis and design.\n    \n\n\n          Originality/value:\n        \n      \n      Overall, the study makes a significant contribution to healthcare organizations, better health outcomes for patients and better quality of life for the community.",
