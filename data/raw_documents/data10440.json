  "abstract": "Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) (Orphanet ORPHA code: 692305) is an emerging rare adult-onset cardiovascular disease, first identified in Japan. In TGCV, defective intracellular lipolysis of long-chain triglycerides results in cellular steatosis and energy failure, leading to intractable heart failure, diffuse coronary artery disease, and ventricular arrhythmia. A hallmark of TGCV diagnosis is the reduced washout rate (WR) of ",
