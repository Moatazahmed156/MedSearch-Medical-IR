  "abstract": "MraY is an essential bacterial enzyme for peptidoglycan synthesis in cell walls and serves as a promising but unrealized target for developing effective antibacterial drugs. Nature has provided a remarkable array of nucleoside inhibitors of MraY, and researchers have skillfully refined these structures to develop inhibitors that effectively mimic natural products. Yet, both natural products and their synthetic variants often face challenges regarding inadequate ",
