    "abstract": "Low back pain is commonly seen in physical therapy practice, and many methods of treatment are used to reduce it. In this article, we discuss the magnitude of the low back pain problem, outline the various treatment methods, and develop a strategy to classify and standardize the treatment of the patient who has low back pain. We will develop this thought process by discussing five management considerations: (1) the dilemma of diagnosis, (2) the information gained from the assessment, (3) a patient classification system, (4) the objectives of the low back treatment process, and (5) a proposed physical therapy intervention model that matches the objectives of treatment to the classification of the patient.",
