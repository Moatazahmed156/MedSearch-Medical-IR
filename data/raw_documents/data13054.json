  "abstract": "The relationships between 24-h time-use composition (i.e., sleep, sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) and brain morphology in older adulthood remain poorly understood. We examined associations between 24-h time-use composition and brain age using compositional data analysis, predicting that 24-h time use would be associated with brain age and that a greater amount of time engaged in MVPA would drive associations with younger brain age. Baseline data from the Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE;  The final sample included 573 adults (69.8±3.7 years, 407 females). It was found that 24-h time-use composition was associated with brain age (F = 2.72,  These results suggest that 24-h time use, especially time spent in MVPA, relates to structural brain age in late adulthood. Maintaining or increasing MVPA may help preserve younger brain age, irrespective of which behaviors this time was reallocated from. Future research should examine whether systematically shifting 24-h time use toward MVPA alters brain aging trajectories.Clinical Trial Registration Number and Name of Trial Registry: ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02875301. Time use relates to brain age in older adults.More time spent in MVPA may contribute to younger brain age.Associations between time use and brain age are independent of demographic variation or genetic risk for AD.",
