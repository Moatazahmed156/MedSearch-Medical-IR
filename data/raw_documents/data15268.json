  "abstract": "Magnetic anchor-guided endoscopic submucosal dissection (MAG-ESD) has significant advantages in the treatment of difficult lesions (Mortagy et al. in World J Gastroenterol 23:2883-2890, 2017). However, the main problem of MAG-ESD is that the placement of the magnetic anchor in vivo often requires the withdrawal and reinsertion of the endoscope, which prolongs the operation time (Zhang et al. in Tech Coloproctol 27:679-683, 2023). We introduced a novel technique, magnetic hydrogel-assisted ESD, and compared it with conventional ESD to explore its advantages and disadvantages. We uniformly configured 0.5% sodium alginate (Sanchez-Ballester et al. in Carbohydr Polym 270:118399, 2021) (SA) solution, 1% CaCl The median submucosal dissection time for magnetic hydrogel-assisted ESD (MHA-ESD) and conventional ESD was 15.13 min (IQR 11.21-19.05) and 17.89 min (IQR 13.74-22.04), respectively. The submucosal dissection time for MHA-ESD was significantly shorter compared to conventional ESD (P = 0.0368). Similarly, the submucosal dissection speed for MHA-ESD and conventional ESD was 74.81 mm Compared with conventional ESD, MHA-ESD significantly accelerates the speed of submucosal dissection, effectively improves surgical efficiency, and enhances procedural convenience, thereby reducing the overall difficulty of ESD.",
