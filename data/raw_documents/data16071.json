  "abstract": "Bloodborne pathogens including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and  Cases of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) were analyzed by using ELISA. Infection rates were quantified as stratified percentages based on sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. Chi-square trend tests were performed to examine the variation in trends. The chi-square test was performed to evaluate associations between sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and occupation) and the risk of pathogen infection (HBV, HCV, HIV, and  Analysis of 231,733 blood samples from 114,593 donors revealed an overall 0.51% seropositivity for TTIs, with prevalence rates of HBV (0.23%), HCV (0.03%), HIV (0.03%), and syphilis (0.22%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, a declining trend was observed for all infections. The chi-square test disclosed that HBV and  Continuous monitoring of the prevalence of TTIs among blood donors offers valuable information for ensuring blood safety and new directions in the development of blood transfusion systems.",
