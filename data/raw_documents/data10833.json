  "title": "Infant gut anellovirus composition associates with early life factors and childhood atopic disease.",
  "abstract": "Anelloviruses are single-stranded circular DNA viruses that infect eukaryotic cells. They are acquired in infancy and can be found in most body compartments. The Anelloviridae family is highly prevalent and genetically diverse, but factors shaping the composition and the relationship with disease remain elusive. Here, we characterise faecal viromes of 647 one-year-old children from the deeply phenotyped Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood",
