  "title": "COVID-19 and its impact on healthcare services provided to patients with COPD: a qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted primary healthcare for chronic disease patients, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Information about whether virtual or remote consultations were effective or acceptable to patients with COPD is sparse. E-consultation and telephone triage strategies were deployed, with the vast majority of triaged consultations taking place over the phone or through video calls. This study explored the views of patients with COPD and providers on the effects of the pandemic on their health and healthcare, and barriers to/enablers of remote consultations. 12 semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions were conducted via telephone/Zoom among patients with COPD and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the West Midlands, UK. Patients with COPD were recruited from the Birmingham Lung Improvement StudieS (BLISS) cohort. HCPs were approached via an advert distributed through general practitioner practices that were part of the BLISS cohort; brief adverts were disseminated to several professional organisations throughout the West Midlands area and social media. Interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six steps of thematic analysis. Three major themes around coping and life adjustment, NHS service accessibility and healthcare inequalities related to e-health literacy. Post-pandemic priorities should include enhancing remote consultation training for providers, with a focus on rapport-building and care delivery. Equally important are providing flexible healthcare access, continuity of care and targeted support for vulnerable patients with COPD to maintain essential services during crises.",
