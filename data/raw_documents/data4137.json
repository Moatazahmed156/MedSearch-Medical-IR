    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Targeted radiotherapy, surgery, and localised disease progression can all result in fistulous tract formation in patients with a pelvic malignancy, in particular cervical or endometrial cancer. This report discusses a novel technique for palliative management of ureterovaginal fistulas in end-stage disease.\n    \n\n\n          Presentation of case report:\n        \n      \n      We report the case of a 37 year old female with metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma previously treated with chemoradiation who presented with progressive disease and secondary development of a symptomatic ureterovaginal fistula.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This case report discusses the causes and sequalae of uretero-vaginal fistula formation, the role of the interventional radiology with regards to palliative intervention, and potential patient factors that can affect performance of such procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Interventional radiology plays an important role in palliative and symptomatic management of end stage malignant disease. Ureteric embolisation via a retrograde transurethral approach by way of an existing stent is a novel approach to access making the procedure easier for both the patient and radiologist.",
