Over half of these cardiovascular deaths are due to acute myocardial infarction. Management of the patient with acute myocardial infarction during and after hospitalization is discussed with an emphasis on primary and secondary prevention, patient autonomy and decision making. There is also a review of the directions that treatment of acute myocardial infarction will take in the future.",
