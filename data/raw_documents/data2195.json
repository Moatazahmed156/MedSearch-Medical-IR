    "abstract": "Spinal cord injuries disproportionately affect young males in their peak wage-earning years, with catastrophic personal and economic consequences. New pharmacological and surgical interventions have evolved from extensive research on the pathophysiology and biomechanics of SCI. Management of SCI must be individualized and will depend on the level and severity of the injury and the patient's medical condition. Rehabilitation is integral to the treatment of SCI to help patients achieve their highest possible level of function. Prevention of spinal cord injuries, however, is the optimal strategy, and neurosurgeons should actively participate in prevention programs.",
