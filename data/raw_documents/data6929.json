    "abstract": "Participation in elite sporting activities is becoming increasingly popular for individuals with brain injury. This article outlines the types of brain injury and the associated movement dysfunctions. In addition, specific pathophysiologic and medical challenges facing athletes with brain injury are discussed. Further research conducted using athletes with brain injury will add to the existing literature indicating the benefits of athletic training in this population. Increased scientific study within this area stands to further improve understanding of the complex interaction between neuromuscular impairment and athletic performance.",
