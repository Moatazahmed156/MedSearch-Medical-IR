  "title": "Safety Profile of Using Tocilizumab in the Treatment of Severely Ill Patients with COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "Tocilizumab, originally used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, had its use expanded to treat hyperinflammatory changes in coronavirus disease 2019. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of secondary infections and gastrointestinal side effects in patients treated with tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 infection. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 97 patients to evaluate the safety of tocilizumab use in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Thirty patients (30.9%) were diagnosed as having a secondary infection; all of these patients required mechanical ventilation. These patients had higher 30-day mortality and longer lengths of stay compared with those without a secondary infection. The results of our study suggest a degree of safety in short-term tocilizumab use and suggests that clinicians pay attention to the elevated risk of secondary infection in the patient population treated with tocilizumab and require a ventilator for respiratory support.",
