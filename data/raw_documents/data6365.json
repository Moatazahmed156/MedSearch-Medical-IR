    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that chronic increment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be involved in the development and progression of chronic prostatic disease, such as BPH and PCa; adipose tissue produces bioactive substances called adipokines, also involved in the production of ROS. Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between obesity and oxidative stress in prostate disease.",
