    "abstract": "Lung transplantation offers a major survival benefit in selected patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. In recent years, there is accumulating evidence of an increase in solid organ tumors and especially in primary lung cancer. There is also some anecdotal evidence that lung transplantation may be beneficial as a treatment option in some patients with lung cancer, such as the ones with extensive bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. In this review, we analyze the literature data reporting the incidence of lung cancer after lung transplantation with its inherent risk factors, and we summarize the available data on possible treatment of lung cancer by lung transplantation. Finally, bronchial epithelial chimerism as possible cause for lung cancer is discussed.",
