    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Glucocorticoids represent the standard therapy for reducing inflammation and immune activation in various diseases. However, as with any potent medication, they are not without side effects. Glucocorticoid-associated side effects may involve most major organ systems. Musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine, neuropsychiatric, dermatologic, ocular, and immunologic side effects are all possible.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      This article analyzes English-language literature and provides an update on the most recent literature regarding side effects of systemic glucocorticoid treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      The risk/benefit ratio of glucocorticoid therapy can be improved by proper use. Careful monitoring and using appropriate preventive strategies can potentially minimize side effects.",
