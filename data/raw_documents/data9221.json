    "abstract": "The implications of scientific breakthroughs are rarely faced up to in advance of their realization. Stem cell-derived human gametes, a disruptive technology in waiting, are likely to recapitulate this historic pattern absent active intervention. Herein we call for the conduct of thoughtful ante hoc deliberations on the prospect of stem cell-derived human gametes with an eye toward minimizing potential untoward post hoc regulatory or statutory impositions.",
