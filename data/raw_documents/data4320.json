    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Rabbits are easily available and docile animals; thus, they are a promising model for medical research. White New Zealand rabbits are usually employed for research.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to determine the kidney's histological structure using rabbit embryos and fetuses at various stages of gestation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Morphogenesis and histogenesis of the kidney were assessed using Harris's hematoxylin and eosin staining at different gestational periods in rabbits.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Around the 10th day of gestation, the intermediate mesoderm started to differentiate into kidney tissue. The first primitive form of the kidney was the pronephros, which consisted of pronephric tubules and ducts. Large mesonephroi occupied a large part of the abdominal cavity from the 13th day of gestation and persisted for several days. At 15th day of gestation, the permanent kidney, the metanephros, began its differentiation and then persevered until formation of the adult kidney tissue at 24th day of gestation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study clarified normal kidney histogenesis in rabbits; this would provide better understanding of kidney diseases aid in kidney transplant.",
