  "title": "Management of Refractory Hepatic Encephalopathy.",
  "abstract": "Refractory hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex and debilitating disorder that significantly impacts healthcare utilization and causes lingering cognitive defects that can at times be permanent. It represents an economically and emotionally costly entity for patients and caregivers. Precipitants and pathogenic factors of this disease are numerous, cumulative, and often present with subtle features. A systematic approach to management should include a thorough evaluation of medication adherence, identification of precipitating factors, consideration of a rare disease called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration in patients with pyramidal symptoms, and assessment for both iatrogenic and spontaneous portosystemic shunts. Second-line treatments may include branched-chain amino acids, zinc supplementation, probiotics, and shunt embolization procedures, which have demonstrated significant improvements in HE episodes and hospitalizations. Strong clinical acumen and a systematic approach are essential for improving outcomes in this challenging patient population with refractory HE.",
