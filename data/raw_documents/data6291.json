    "abstract": "Prostate disorders are commonplace in medicine, especially in older men, with prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and prostate cancer being the most abundant pathologies. The complexity of this organ, however, turns treatment into a challenge. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the efficacy of alternative treatments, which are not normally used in conventional medicine, with a particular focus on nutrients. In order to understand why and how nutrition can be beneficial in diseases of the prostate, we give an overview of the known characteristics and features of this organ. Then, we provide a summary of the most prevalent prostate illnesses. Finally, we propose nutrition-based treatment in each of these prostate problems, based on in-depth research concerning its effects in this context, with an emphasis on surgery. Overall, we plead for an upgrade of this form of alternative treatment to a fully recognized mode of therapy for the prostate.",
