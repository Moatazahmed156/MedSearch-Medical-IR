  "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of cystatin SA (CST2) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression. However, the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance of CST2 in NSCLC remain unexplored, highlighting the need for a comprehensive investigation to identify potential therapeutic targets. The study recruited 69 NSCLC patients and purchased NSCLC cell lines including A549, PC-9, and H1299 as well as human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) for the study. The mRNA levels of CST2 and transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) were quantified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, while their protein expression was assessed by western blotting or immunohistochemistry assay. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were analyzed using the 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, transwell migration and invasion assays, respectively.
