  "title": "High-resolution monitoring of air pollution and climate variability in the Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra basins: Insights into physical drivers.",
  "abstract": "The Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra river basins are now among the world's most climate sensitive regions, driven by rapid population growth, improper land utilization, extensive land use and land cover (LULC) changes, and worsening air pollution. This study uses several high-resolution reanalysis datasets, together with the non-parametric statistical techniques and Google Earth Engine (GEE) algorithms, to assess air pollution, climate variability, and their physical drivers across annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal timescales from 2010 to 2023. The findings reveal a substantial increase in air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, UV absorbing aerosols, and atmospheric formaldehyde, averaging 0.06 mol/m",
