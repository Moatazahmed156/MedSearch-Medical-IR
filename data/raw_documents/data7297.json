    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To compare the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 of nasopharyngeal carcinoma at Xi'an and Shenzhen area.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The protein expression of MMP 9 and TIMP 1 were studied by immunohistochemistry staining in 21 cases nasopharyngeal carcinoma of Xi'an and 22 cases of Shenzhen.\n    \n\n\n          Result:\n        \n      \n      The expression positive rates of MMP-9 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues at Xi'an and Shenzhen were 61.90% and 68.18%. The positive rates of TIMP-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues at two regions were 28.57% and 31.82%. The expression between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were negative relationship either Xi'an or Shenzhen. The expression of MMP-9 was positively correlated to lymph node metastasis, and TIMP-1 was no relationship with lymph node metastasis. The expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was no difference between Xi'an and Shenzhen.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma 2 tissues was no difference between Xi'an and Shenzhen. Increase of MMP-9 play an important role in progression and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
