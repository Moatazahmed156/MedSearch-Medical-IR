  "abstract": "This study examines the differences between male and female Alzheimer's Disease patients diagnosed with Attention Concentration Deficit (ADACD) and Cognitive Communicative Disorder (ADCCD), focusing on pharmacological and demographic factors. A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify pharmacological and demographic factors associated with ADACD and ADCCD in male and female patients. In the adjusted analysis for male patients, use of donepezil (OR = 1.683, 95 % CI: 1.172-2.417, p = 0.005), and risperidone (Risperdal) use (OR = 3.177, 95 % CI: 1.841-5.484, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with ADCCD. The use of memantine (OR = 0.189, 95 % CI: 0.091-0.393, p < 0.001), aripiprazole (OR = 0.065, 95 % CI: 0.015-0.278, p < 0.001), were associated with ADACD. For female patients, citalopram use (OR = 2.470, 95 % CI: 1.751-3.484, p < 0.001) was associated with ADCCD. These results underscore the urgent need to establish strategies aimed at addressing sex disparities in the care of ADACD and ADCCD patients.",
