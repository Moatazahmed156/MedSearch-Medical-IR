  "title": "Cardiometabolic Outcomes after Surgical Remission of Endogenous Hypercortisolism: a Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "Evidence on the evolution of cardiometabolic comorbidities following surgical remission of hypercortisolism is scarce. To determine the impact of surgical remission on cardiometabolic comorbidities in patients with endogenous hypercortisolism and to identify factors associated with cardiometabolic improvement. Prospective single-center cohort study (2019-2025) of adults with Cushing syndrome (CS) or mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) with surgical remission of hypercortisolism. Outcomes included 1) changes in severity of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and obesity between baseline, 3-, and 12-months post-remission and 2) factors associated with improvement in comorbidities. Among 357 patients (49% MACS, 36% pituitary CS, 10% adrenal CS, 5% ectopic CS; median age 53 years [IQR 42-62]; 81% women), 336 (94%) had hypertension, 241 (68%) had obesity, and 122 (35%) had DM. At a median of 12 months post-surgery, improvement in hypertension occurred in 70% (90/128) of patients with CS and 51% (60/117) of patients with MACS, DM in 90% (46/51) patients with CS and 37% (13/35) patients with MACS, and obesity in 79% (77/97) patients with CS and 20% (14/71) patients with MACS. In a multivariable analysis, higher baseline biochemical severity scores were associated with improvement in hypertension (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), DM (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-4.1), and obesity (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8) at a median of 12 months post-remission of hypercortisolism. Post-surgical improvement of cardiometabolic comorbidities was observed in both patients with CS and MACS. Higher baseline biochemical severity scores were associated with higher post-remission improvement in comorbidities.",
