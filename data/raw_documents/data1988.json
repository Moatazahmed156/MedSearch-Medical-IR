    "abstract": "Lumbar spine injections play a role in the evaluation and treatment of low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy. These injection procedures have been demonstrated to be effective in determining the pain generator for low back pain. There is still debate as to the long-term pain relief from epidural and intra-articular facet joint injections, and no controlled studies have examined the long-term effects of SI joint injections. Additional investigation is certainly warranted to evaluate further the long-term benefits and determine with patients would benefit the most from these injections. Current evidence validates that these injections provide temporary relief of low back and radicular leg pain up to several months, if not longer. This duration of pain relief creates an opportunity to maximize rehabilitation efforts while symptoms are minimal.",
