  "title": "MRI patterns and clinical outcomes in cerebral palsy: insights from a large MRICS-based cohort.",
  "abstract": "To classify MRI patterns in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using the MRI Classification System (MRICS) and examine their associations with perinatal risk factors and clinical outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included 1,403 children with CP who underwent post-neonatal cranial MRI between 2011 and 2020. MRI patterns were categorized using MRICS. We analyzed the associations between MRI findings and perinatal risk factors (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, sex, perinatal adversity, plurality) using univariate and multivariable multinomial logistic regression. Clinical outcomes-including CP subtype, gross motor function, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and composite impairment index-were assessed using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and correspondence analysis. MRI abnormalities were observed in 86.5% of children, with predominant white matter injury (PWMI) being most common (46.5%). Preterm birth and perinatal adversity significantly increased the risk of PWMI and PGMI. PWMI was linked with spastic CP, better motor outcomes, and lower rates of intellectual disability. In contrast, PGMI and maldevelopments were associated with epilepsy, hearing loss, and severe impairment. Importantly, a subset of children with normal MRI findings still exhibited substantial functional impairments, emphasizing the limitations of structural imaging alone. MRI patterns, as classified by MRICS, provide critical insight into the neurodevelopmental heterogeneity of CP. Normal MRI findings do not preclude significant clinical impairment, underscoring the need for integrated neuroimaging and clinical-genetic assessment in CP management.",
