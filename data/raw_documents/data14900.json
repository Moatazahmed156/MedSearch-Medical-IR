  "title": "Prognosis after resection or ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: real-world evidence from a Danish population-based cohort.",
  "abstract": "The real-world clinical course of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. We aimed to describe the prognosis of Danish patients with HCC treated with curative-intent resection or ablation strategies. This was a population-based, historical cohort study of all patients with HCC within two Danish regions (population 2 million). Information was extracted from patients' medical records. Patients diagnosed with HCC in 2013-2023 and treated first-line with resection/ablation with curative intent were included. We used multistate models, competing risk analyses, and cause-specific Cox models to describe the clinical course and examine risk factors for recurrence. The cohort comprised 296 patients [79% male; median age 69 years (IQR 62-76); 60% ( This population-based real-world study demonstrated that current curative-intent treatment strategies for early HCC are insufficient for long-term disease control, and that we need more effective management and follow-up of patients with HCC.",
