    "abstract": "Gastric cancer accounts for about 6% of cancers worldwide, being the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer related death. Gastric carcinogenesis is a multistep and multifactorial process and is the result of the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The identification of predisposing conditions and of precancerous lesions is the basis for screening programs and early stage treatment. Furthermore, although most gastric cancers are sporadic, familial clustering is observed in up to 10% of patients. Among them, hereditary cases, related to known cancer susceptibility syndromes and/or genetic causes are thought to account for 1-3% of all gastric cancers. The pathology report of gastric resections specimens therefore requires a standardized approach as well as in depth knowledge of prognostic and treatment associated factors.",
