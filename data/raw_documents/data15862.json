  "title": "Biofabrication of chitosan-loaded gold nanoparticles: investigation of antimicrobial and anticancer activity and its morphological assessment in liver cancer cells.",
  "abstract": "The rise of antimicrobial resistance to current antibiotics has driven researchers to discover novel natural compounds with antibacterial properties. This study established a sustainable approach for the biofabrication of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) utilizing Ephedra alata leaf extracts conjugated with environmentally friendly, less-toxic, and chitosan (CS), resulting in chitosan (CS)-loaded gold nanoparticles (CS@GNPs). The characterization of GNPs and CS@GNPs is performed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and DLS measurements. This investigation evaluated the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the agar diffusion technique using human pathogens. The IC",
