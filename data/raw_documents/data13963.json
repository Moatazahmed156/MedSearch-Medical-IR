  "title": "Pathological characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine Shi Zheng and related therapeutic formula, effective compounds: a general review.",
  "abstract": "Shi Zheng (Dampness syndrome) is a prevalent condition in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome caused by the humid environment (external dampness) or metabolic imbalance (internal dampness) and characterized by sense of heaviness in the body and numbness in the limbs. Most Shi Zheng patients suffer from metabolic disorders and inflammation, and they were diagnosed as the diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus by modern medicine, and they are prone to complications or recurrent episodes despite long-term medication. Chinese medicine formulas (CMFs) and their effective compounds have shown promising results in treating these diseases, with high cure rates and a low incidence of adverse events. However, modern science has yet to establish a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms between Shi Zheng, related diseases, and CMFs, probably because of the extremely abstract concept of TCM syndrome. Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of the characteristics of Shi Zheng and the effects of CMFs and active compounds in TCMs on typical diseases associated with Shi Zheng to clarify the concrete connection between TCM symptoms and modern diseases, thereby to bridge the gap between TCM syndrome concepts and modern medicine.",
