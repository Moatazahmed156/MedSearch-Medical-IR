    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant changes in the lifestyle and dietary habits of the population characterized by an increased intake of high-calorie food and a sedentary lifestyle without physical activity. The increased prevalence of overweight and obesity has led to metabolic dysfunction and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance, clinical features, and pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated kidney disease (MDAKD). MDAKD is a term that describes kidney disease arising from metabolic dysfunction, often in the context of metabolic syndrome, and is characterized by the presence of chronic kidney disease in individuals with metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. MDAKD includes diabetic kidney disease, obesity-related kidney disease, and, increasingly, other less common kidney diseases where metabolic dysfunction may affect disease progression. MDAKD is part of a spectrum of diseases whose pathogenesis is driven by metabolic dysfunction and has recently led to the proposal of a new nomenclature including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and cardio-kidney-metabolic syndrome. The new terminology of MDAKD places additional emphasis on the pathogenic role of metabolic dysfunction in kidney disease.",
