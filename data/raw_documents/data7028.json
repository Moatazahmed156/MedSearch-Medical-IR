    "abstract": "Among the most deadly malignancies that strike women worldwide, ovarian cancer is still one of the most common. The primary factor affecting a patient's survival is early lesion discovery. Unfortunately, because ovarian cancer is a sneaky illness that usually manifests as nonspecific symptoms only in advanced stages, its early detection and screening are challenging. A lot of research is being conducted on effective methods of diagnosing and treating ovarian cancer. Recently, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have gained great popularity, which are considered to be the main regulators of many cellular processes, especially those occurring in cancer. LncRNAs are also being studied for their therapeutic use in the treatment of ovarian cancer and their use in diagnostics and as indicators of poor prognosis. In this article, we reviewed lncRNAs described in the literature that may play an important role in ovarian cancer.",
