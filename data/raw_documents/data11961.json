  "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with rapid progression, high metastatic risk, and limited treatment options. Clinical TNBC specimens show severe hypoxia along with elevated expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). Inspired by these patient-derived hallmarks, it is engineered targeted self-assembled albumin-cerium oxide nanozymes (ACCD NPs) that couple SPARC-mediated tumor targeting with catalytic hypoxia modulation for synergistic sonodynamic-chemotherapy. Albumin enables selective delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) via SPARC-receptor interactions, while oxygen vacancy-engineered cerium oxide (CeO",
