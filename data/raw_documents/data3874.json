    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the effect of vardenafil in kidney of rats submitted to acute ischemia and reperfusion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-eight rats were randomly distributed into two groups. Right nephrectomy was performed and the vardenafil group received vardenafil solution (at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mg/kg) while the control group received 0.9% saline solution (SS) one hour prior to the ligature of the left renal pedicle. After one hour of ischemia, animals were submitted to twenty-four hours of reperfusion, followed by left nephrectomy. The kidney's histological parameters evaluated on the study included vacuolar degeneration and tubular necrosis. Apoptosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 using the point-counting and digital methods (Cytophotometry). Also, a biochemical analysis for creatinine was conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were statistically significant differences between groups only with regards to the vacuolar degeneration parameter and to the cleaved caspase-3 digital method.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Vardenafil showed a protective effect on the kidney of rats subjected to acute ischemia and reperfusion in this model.",
