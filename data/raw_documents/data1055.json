    "abstract": "This review presents several areas of current interest in head and neck oncology including endoscopic and conservation management of early laryngeal cancer, intraoperative radiotherapy, and microvascular reconstruction techniques. Endoscopic treatment of early laryngeal cancer using the CO2 laser has been shown to be effective in several recent studies, and improved laryngeal reconstruction techniques following conservation laryngeal surgery have resulted in improved functional results. Intraoperative radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma has received more attention recently, with encouraging results for the treatment of advanced and recurrent skull base and head and neck tumors. New techniques of free flap reconstruction following surgery for head and neck cancer continue to result in improved rehabilitation.",
