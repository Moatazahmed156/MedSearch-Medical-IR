  "title": "T1/T2-weighted Ratio to Improve MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound-induced Chronic Lesion Contrast in Patients with Tremor Syndrome.",
  "abstract": "Background T2-weighted MRI is the standard for visualizing MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy lesions in essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson disease (TDPD); however, chronic lesion visibility is often variable, including low-contrast or undetectable lesions, complicating long-term assessment, especially in patients with tremor recurrence. Purpose To determine whether T1/T2-weighted ratio imaging improves the lesion normalized contrast (NC) of chronic MRgFUS thalamotomy-induced lesions compared with T2-weighted imaging. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with ET or TDPD who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy (January 2019 to November 2023). Lesion NC was quantified on T1/T2-weighted ratio and T2-weighted images at the 6-month follow-up. Between-modality NC comparisons used paired ",
