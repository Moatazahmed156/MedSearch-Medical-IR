    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a frequently observed type of gynaecologic malignancy generally associated with poor prognosis around the world. Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) form the largest subfamily of deubiquitylating enzymes and have emerged as potential therapeutic targets against human cancers. Through a systematic analysis of the prognostic significance of USP expression, USP2 was found to be inversely correlated with patient survival in ovarian cancer. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of USP2 on ovarian cancer by exploiting its small molecule inhibitor ML364. Our findings show that ML364 effectively hindered ovarian cancer growth and migration using a series of in vitro assays. In addition to apoptosis induction, ML364 also sensitized ovarian cancer cells to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, ML364 treatment resulted in cyclin D1 downregulation, increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and elevated ROS levels in ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest USP2 as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, and hence, its pharmacological inhibition warrants further investigation.",
