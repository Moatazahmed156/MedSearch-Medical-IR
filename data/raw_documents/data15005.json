  "title": "Targeting RNA Polymerase I Inhibits Ribosome Biogenesis to Block Liver Fibrosis Progression.",
  "abstract": "Liver fibrosis significantly burdens global health, and increased protein synthesis during hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation plays a crucial role in its progression. Ribosome is the site of protein synthesis. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a protein that regulates the transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes into ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in ribosomal biogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the role and mechanism of Pol I-regulated ribosome biogenesis in HSCs activation and liver fibrosis progression. Initially, we assessed the expression levels of Pol I in the serum of patients diagnosed with liver fibrosis. Then, we assessed Pol I-regulated ribosome biogenesis levels in mouse models of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl Pol I levels were elevated in the serum of patients with liver fibrosis. Additionally, Pol I-regulated ribosome biogenesis levels were significantly increased in both MASH and CCl Pol I-regulated ribosome biogenesis is significantly increased during HSCs activation and liver fibrosis progression. Pol I may serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis.",
