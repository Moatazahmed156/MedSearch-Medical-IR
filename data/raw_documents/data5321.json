    "abstract": "All physicians should be alerted to the many drugs and other agents that are associated with drug-related lupus, as there is an increasing number of such drugs. A wide range of immune responses and antibodies are being reported with this syndrome. A new concern is the perceived ability of new biologic treatments to induce these autoimmune phenomena. More in-depth studies of various environmental factors are providing new insights into possible mechanisms. These include the immune responses to the drugs, their metabolites, and drug-altered conjugates; bioactivation mechanisms of drug protein conjugation; the role of macrophages in antigen recognition and processing; and lastly, the important role of the acetylation of various drugs and the relationship to immunogenetic factors. Continued study of this human experimental model of lupus will help to clarify the etiology and mechanisms of systemic lupus erythematosus itself.",
