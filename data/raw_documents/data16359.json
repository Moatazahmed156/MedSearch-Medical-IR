  "abstract": "Acute respiratory infections(ARIs) represent a major global public health concern and affect all age groups. Children are infected approximately two to three times more frequently than adults. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and seasonality of viral pathogens associated with respiratory tract infections in children in our region. Between January 2019 and December 2024, respiratory viral pathogens were analyzed using the Rotor-GeneQ MDxdevice (Qiagen, Germany) with the FastTrack Diagnostics \"FTD Respiratory Pathogens 21 Assay\" multiplex real-time PCR kit. The most frequently detected viral pathogen was RSV A/B (25.18%), while the least detected was PIV1 (0.54%). The most common pathogens were RSV A/B in 2019 and 2023, RSV A/B in 2020, PIV3 in 2021, RSVA/B in 2022, and Rhinovirus in 2024. RSV A/B was the most frequently detected virus in both girls and boys. HMPV A/B was significantly more common in males (p<0.05). Viral pathogens were detected in 73.60% of individuals aged ≤1 year, with RSV A/B being the most frequently identified. ARIs peaked during the winter months and were lowest in the summer. ARIs reached their highest level in December and dropped significantly in August. RSV A/B predominated in December, January, February, and March; Rhinovirus in April, May, and June; Adenovirus in July, August, September, and October; and Bocavirus in November. Monitoring the annual and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses is critical for predicting and identifying epidemics and pandemics. This approach can help ensure accurate pathogen identification and prevent inappropriate antimicrobial treatments.",
