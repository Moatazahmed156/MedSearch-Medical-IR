    "abstract": "Triploidy is an effective tool for producing sterile fishes but often results in impaired performance in commercial aquaculture. In light of this, our study compared the physiological response to exhaustive exercise in juvenile diploid and triploid Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, a polar species with great potential for aquaculture. A standard ramping swimming protocol revealed no significant difference in critical swimming velocity (Ucrit) between ploidies. There was also no effect of ploidy on post-Ucrit blood glucose, lactate or haematocrit. However, triploids had a significantly higher frequency of erythrocyte nuclear segmentation. Independent of ploidy, there was also a significant positive correlation between blood lactate levels and Ucrit. We conclude that triploidy does not impair the response to exhaustive exercise in juvenile S. alpinus.",
