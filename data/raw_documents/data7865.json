    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity has led to a corresponding rise in metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is associated with a significant risk of kidney disease. There is a complex relationship between pediatric obesity and MetS, with metabolic derangements such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, contributing to kidney damage through multiple mechanisms. A focus on pediatric cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health may lead to improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and management of MetS and kidney disease. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate MetS as a significant cause of kidney disease in children.",
