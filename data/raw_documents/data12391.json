  "title": "Freestanding plasmonic BiVO",
  "abstract": "Precise manipulation of interfacial charge carrier transport is essential for developing high-performance photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors with minimal background and high anti-interference capability in complex matrices. In this work, we present a novel low-background PEC biosensing platform capable of programmable switching of carrier transfer direction for the sensitive detection of PARP-1 in cancer tissues. The sensing architecture is based on freestanding plasmonic Schottky junctions formed by integrating Au nanoparticles into electrospun BiVO",
