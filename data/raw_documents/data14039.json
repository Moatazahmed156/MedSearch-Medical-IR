  "abstract": "Early detection of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is important. Spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame (T To evaluate if stretched- (SE) and bi-exponential (BE) T Case-control study. Twenty-six healthy subjects (mean age 51.5) and 26 early knee OA patients (mean age 61.8). T T Parameters were adjusted for age. Mann-Whitney U-test (group comparisons), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CI). Significance level set at p < 0.05, using the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple comparisons. In the global analysis, no model demonstrated significant diagnostic performance (p-values of 0.63, 0.96, 0.63 for ME, SE, and BE). Multi-regional SE model (AUC = 0.83, CI: 0.72, 0.93) significantly distinguished OA and healthy groups. Calibration analysis showed the SE model had the lowest Brier score (0.17), significantly better than the ME model (0.26). Sub-regional analysis of T 4. Stage 2. Knee osteoarthritis is a disease that leads to the degradation of the knee joint, and its early detection is important for managing the disease. However, standard imaging methods often fail to reveal subtle changes in cartilage health. The purpose of the study was to see if advanced MRI analysis could improve early disease identification. Researchers compared the standard measurement methods with complex models that map the quality of cartilage in specific areas of the knee. The study results showed that a region‐specific model was capable of better distinguishing the early‐stage disease signs.",
