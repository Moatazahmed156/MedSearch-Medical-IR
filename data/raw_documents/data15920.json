  "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant  We included patients prescribed vancomycin for pneumonia and defined three cohorts: pre-intervention (Cohort 1), post-test implementation (Cohort 2), and post-test implementation with electronic medical record (EMR) enhancements and active stewardship involvement (Cohort 3). The primary outcome was total duration of vancomycin treatment. We performed a desirability of outcome ranking with response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (DOOR/RADAR) analysis to prioritize clinical outcomes including adverse events, escalation of care, and death. The median duration of vancomycin therapy decreased between Cohorts 1 and 2 (55 versus 47 hours,  Vancomycin treatment duration was shorter in patients after a pharmacy-directed, EMR-based MRSA PCR intervention was implemented, with a greater response after implementation of additional EMR enhancements and active stewardship involvement, improving test collection rate and result response. This study will help inform future interventions pairing automated EMR-based interventions with stewardship team efforts.",
