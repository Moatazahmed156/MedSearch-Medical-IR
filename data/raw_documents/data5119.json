    "abstract": "I have spent more than the last 40 years at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), studying T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. I was blessed with supportive mentors, an exceptionally talented group of trainees, and wonderful collaborators and colleagues during my journey who have enabled me to make significant contributions to our understanding of how the TCR initiates signaling. TCR signaling events contribute to T cell development as well as to mature T cell activation and differentiation.",
