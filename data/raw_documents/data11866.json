  "title": "Exploring the Role of Long Noncoding RNAs in Breast Cancer Progression: A Comprehensive Study on Biomarkers and Therapeutic Approaches.",
  "abstract": "Among the many forms of cancer that plague women all over the globe, breast cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent kinds. BC is a multifaceted disease that can manifest in many ways depending on the individual. The identification of new biomarkers that may be used to diagnose and prognosis of the BC, as well as those that can aid in the creation of novel therapeutic approaches and the understanding of how to regulate multiple pathways in metastasis, may initiate the process of creating novel therapeutic interventions for cancer patients. According to data from recent studies, long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) contribute to the development of BC via several distinct biochemical mechanisms. Remembering that long LncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not encode proteins is essential. Through its interaction with the EGF, TGF-β, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and p53 pathways, the abnormal production of LncRNA has a substantial impact on the progression of BC. This research investigates the biological properties of LncRNAs to ascertain their role in regulating cell signaling pathways and the subsequent changes in cell survival, invasion, and proliferation components that characterize BC.",
