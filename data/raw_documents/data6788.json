    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to define and contrast a explicative model of the relationship between the variables of quality of life that make up the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 1641 Colombian university students aged between 17 and 18 years (17.69 + 0.490) participated in this research (61.2% males and 38.8% females) analyzing the dimensions of the KIDSCREEN-52 quality of life questionnaire. A model of structural equation was made and adjusted (χ2 = 118.021; DF = 6; p < 0.001; CFI = 0.953; NFI = 0.951; IFI = 0.954; RMSEA = 0.076).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The analyzed dimensions of quality of life were related in a positive and direct way, except for the Parent Relationship and Family Life (Family L.) with Social Acceptance (Social A.), which were associated in a negative and indirect manner.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The main conclusion of this investigation is that all dimensions of quality of life associate in a positive manner with the exception of Parent Relationship and Family Life (Family L.) which associated with Social Acceptance (Social A.). The qualities improve together, highlighting the idea that working on any of the areas that comprise quality of life will cause development of the remaining areas.",
