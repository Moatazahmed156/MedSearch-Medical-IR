  "abstract": "The frequency of acute exacerbations (AECOPD) is a critical predictor of disease progression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the dynamics of the lower respiratory microbiome across a spectrum of exacerbation frequency remain poorly characterized, limiting insights into microbial drivers of susceptibility. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 39 hospitalized AECOPD patients, stratified into non-frequent (NFE, ≤ 1 event/year,  Microbial alpha diversity exhibited a significant, graded decline from NFE to FE groups (e.g., Shannon index: NFE 3.68 ± 0.34, ME 3.02 ± 1.02, FE 0.84 ± 0.54;  Our findings delineate a gradient of airway microbial dysbiosis along the exacerbation frequency spectrum in COPD. The exacerbation-prone phenotype is defined by a loss of microbial diversity, expansion of ",
