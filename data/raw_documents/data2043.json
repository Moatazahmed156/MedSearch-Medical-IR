    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Proteins are molecules that have role in the progression of the diseases. Proteomics is a tool that can play an effective role in identifying diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for lung cancer. Cytokines are proteins that play a decisive role in activating body's immune system in lung cancer. They can increase the growth of the tumor (oncogenic cytokines) or limit tumor growth (anti-tumor cytokines) by regulating related signaling pathways such as proliferation, growth, metastasis, and apoptosis.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      In the present study, a total of 223 papers including 196 research papers and 27 review papers, extracted from PubMed and Scopus and published from 1997 to present, are reviewed. The most important involved-cytokines in lung cancer including TNF-α, IFN- γ, TGF-β, VEGF and interleukins such as IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, IL-10, IL-22, IL-1β and IL-18 are introduced. Also, the pathological and biological role of such cytokines in cancer signaling pathways is explained.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      In lung cancer, the cytokine expression changes under the physiological conditions of the immune system, and inflammatory cytokines are associated with the progression of lung cancer. Therefore, the cytokine expression profile can be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic responses, and survival of patients with lung cancer.",
