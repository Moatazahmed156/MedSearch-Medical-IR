  "title": "Divergent effects of exercise training on peak oxygen uptake and 6-min walk distance in older HFpEF patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
  "abstract": "Reduced exercise capacity is a hallmark of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and this limitation is particularly pronounced in older patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a high-risk population characterized by poor prognosis. Although previous studies have demonstrated that exercise training (ET) can improve exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF, its efficacy in older patients with coexisting HFpEF and T2DM remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of ET on peak oxygen uptake (peakVO",
