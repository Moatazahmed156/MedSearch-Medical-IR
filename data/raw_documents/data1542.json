    "abstract": "There is a growing, aging population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) with an increasing incidence of heart failure. Unquestioning extrapolation of widely applicable definitions of heart failure and guidelines for managing heart failure in adults with acquired heart failure to adults with CHD can be problematic. A nuanced and flexible application of clinical judgment founded on a deep understanding of underlying pathophysiology is needed to most effectively apply the many recent advances in managing acquired heart failure to the care of adults with CHD.",
