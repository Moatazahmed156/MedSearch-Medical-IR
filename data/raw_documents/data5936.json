    "abstract": "The N-nitroso-compounds and the bacteriological contamination of gastric juice could represent a risk factor for cancer of the stomach when the mucosal barrier is altered. In the unresected stomach and gastric stump, the hypo-achlorhydria and bilopancreatic reflux permit the development of bacterial flora and the production of N-nitroso-compounds in the presence of nitrite. A survey was performed on 71 patients: 15 normal controls, 31 with gastroduodenal disease (9 gastrites, 10 gastric ulcers, 10 duodenal ulcers, 7 neoplasias), 20 patients with gastric resection (8 BI, 12 BII), using an endoscopic-histopathologic control and a chemical-bacteriological analysis of the gastric juice. We studied the gastric juice for the following parameters: pH, concentration of nitrite, identification of bacterial type, count and nitrate-reductase activity. An inverse relationship was found between the concentration of nitrite and the hydrogen ion concentration. In the alkaline gastric juice, we identified aerobic bacteria with nitrate-reductase activity and anaerobic bacteria. The latter has the ability to transform biliary salts into carcinogenic and cocarcinogenic compounds and to catalyze the nitrosations. The chemicobacteriological characteristics of the gastric juice from gastric ulcers (Johnson type I), atrophic gastrites, and resected stomachs lead one to think that there is a risk of carcinogenesis brought about by the N-nitroso-compounds.",
