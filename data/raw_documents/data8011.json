    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Several risk factors have been empirically linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Some of them are therapeutically amenable to modification; while others are not. Modifiable risk factors include physical inactivity, tobacco use, diet, \"bad fats\" in the blood, hypertension, and being overweight; while non-modifiable risk factors include the patient's family history, the presence versus absence of diabetes mellitus, and demographic characteristics like age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this article, we review those risk factors that are both clinically important and amenable to change.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      To prevent cardiovascular disease, it is important to minimize modifiable risk factors, like LDL cholesterol.",
