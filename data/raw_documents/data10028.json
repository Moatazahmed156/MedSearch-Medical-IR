  "title": "Occupational Health Hazards and Morbidities among Bank Employees in a Metropolitan City, with Special Reference to Hypertension.",
  "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases are on the rise. Changing policies and practices in the financial sector are putting bank employees at risk of developing morbidities, in addition to the sedentary nature of their work and work pressure. Early identification of risks can help prevent morbidities and improve quality of life. The aim of this study was to describe the occupational health hazards and morbidities among bank employees, estimate the proportion of hypertensives, and determine the association of hypertension with known risk factors. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among bank employees of a nationalized bank in Mumbai city. 160 employees were interviewed face-to-face in their residential bank quarters, using an expert-validated case record form containing nine domains. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0. Descriptive analysis was performed using frequency and percent tables. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were applied to determine the association between risk factors and hypertension. 39 (24.4%) employees had hypertension, and 64.4% were found to be pre-hypertensive. 7.5% of participants were diabetic. 16.9% and 25% were obese, as per BMI and waist circumference, respectively. 67% reported musculoskeletal complaints. Visual discomfort was experienced by 39.4% of study subjects. Moderate stress levels were perceived in 61.9% of employees. Age, extra salt consumption, smoking, and central obesity were found to be significantly associated with hypertension among bank employees. Bank employees are at risk of developing hypertension, musculoskeletal morbidities, and stress. Preventive health programs may be undertaken by the banking sector.",
