    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      This paper presents our experience on delayed-onset haematoma formation after cochlear implantation, a topic which has not been well discussed in the literature.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective case review study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five children who had undergone cochlear implant surgery at 1.5 to 4 years of age (median, 2.5 years) were studied. The haematoma episodes occurred 2-12 years (median, 6 years) after cochlear implantation. Two patients had recurrent episodes. Two of the seven haematoma episodes were managed by needle aspiration alone, four by incision and drainage alone, and one by both needle aspiration and incision and drainage. Other than one patient with coagulopathy, there were no obvious predisposing factors, including trauma.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The majority of delayed-onset haematomas occurred without obvious predisposing factors. Needle aspiration can differentiate a haematoma from an abscess or cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and it provides an effective immediate therapeutic solution. However, aseptic techniques are emphasised to minimise the chances of an uncomplicated haematoma converting into a septic one.",
