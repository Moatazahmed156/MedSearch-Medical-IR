    "abstract": "To evaluate prostate cancer (PCa) detection after repeated negative saturation biopsy, 75 patients, aged 53-78 years, underwent transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) because of persistent suspicion of cancer; median PSA was 11.8 ng ml(-1) and 58 men complained lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). In 12 (16%) and 3 (4%) men a T1a and T1b PCa was found with median PSA and Gleason score equal to 14.2 vs 23.6 ng ml(-1) and 5.6 vs 7 ng ml(-1). In case of persistent suspicion of PCa after repeated negative saturation biopsy, TURP may be proposed, aside from the coexistence of LUTS, to rule out a PCa, in younger patients with high PSA values (> or =20 ng ml(-1)).",
