  "title": "Evaluating Asthma Clinical Remission with Inhaled Therapy: Post Hoc Analyses of CAPTAIN.",
  "abstract": "Clinical remission (CR) is an emerging treatment goal in asthma. However, evidence showing whether CR is achievable with inhaled therapy is lacking. This post hoc analysis of CAPTAIN evaluated attainability of a composite CR endpoint with inhaled fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) or FF/VI. CAPTAIN (GSK 205715) was a Phase IIIA, randomized, controlled, 24-52-week trial comparing once-daily single-inhaler FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI in adults with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma despite ICS/LABA. CR was defined as a composite endpoint comprising no systemic corticosteroids, no severe exacerbations, ACQ-5 total score < 1.50, and either change from baseline in FEV More patients met the CR endpoint (lung function stabilization/optimization) with FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI at W24 (stabilization: 42-47% vs 31-36%; optimization: 31-36% vs 19-26%) and W52 (stabilization: 43-47% vs 33-34%; optimization: 30-38% vs 21-24%). Using more stringent ACQ-5 thresholds, fewer patients met the CR endpoint with ACQ ≤ 0.75 versus < 1.50 across treatment arms and timepoints. The odds and probability of meeting the CR endpoint versus not meeting the CR endpoint at W24 were greater with FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI, regardless of FF dose. The results of this post hoc analysis demonstrate that CR is achievable with inhaled therapy in moderate-to-severe asthma and is more likely with FF/UMEC/VI than FF/VI. CR should be considered an attainable treatment goal for patients with asthma, irrespective of disease severity or treatment history. ClinialTrials.gov identifier, NCT02924688.",
