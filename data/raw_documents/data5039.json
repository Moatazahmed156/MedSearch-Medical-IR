    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Present highlights from recent research examining the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Although debate remains about the optimal sequencing of docetaxel and novel androgen directed therapies in addition to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of men with new metastatic prostate cancer, the novel LHRH antagonist relugolix seems poised to become an appealing option in a choice of initial ADT. Novel radioisotopes, genomically selected therapies, and immune therapy combinations show progress in opening up new treatment options for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Although no clear consensus has emerged, evolving data continue to refine the selection of systemic therapies in treatment naïve metastatic prostate cancer. With potentially less cardiotoxic androgen deprivation therapies, novel radioisotopes, targeted pharmaceuticals, and immune therapy combinations, progress appears to be on the horizon in improving outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer.",
