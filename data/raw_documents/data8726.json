    "abstract": "With recent advances in genetic engineering technology, gene therapy is now being considered as a treatment not only for congenital diseases but also acquired diseases, such as cancer. Gene therapeutic agents for hereditary immune disorders, haemophilia, retinal diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and lymphoma have been approved in the United States and Europe. In the field of dermatology, clinical trials of gene therapy have been conducted, because the skin is an easily accessible organ that represents an attractive tissue for gene therapy. In recent years, gene therapy has been attempted for a variety of skin diseases, such as genodermatoses (including epidermolysis bullosa and Netherton syndrome), cutaneous lymphoma, and malignant melanoma. As a result, it is difficult to grasp the current status of gene therapy in dermatology. This review focuses on each of the gene-transfer techniques currently in use and describes the current status of gene therapy for skin diseases using each technology.",
