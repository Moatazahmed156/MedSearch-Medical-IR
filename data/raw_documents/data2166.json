    "abstract": "In the past, little attention has been given in the imaging literature to spinal cord findings in the human immunodeficiency syndrome. This article summarizes the major pathologic conditions found in the spinal cord in patients with AIDS and compares them to MR features. The details of toxoplasma myelitis, spinal cord lymphoma, HIV myelitis, and tract pallor are demonstrated. A review of literature and a description of the pathologic cord changes will help the reader understand the alterations of the spinal cord in patients with AIDS.",
