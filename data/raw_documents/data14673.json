  "title": "Effects of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) on the Cardiovascular System: A Review of Literature.",
  "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone that plays a crucial role in phosphate metabolism; its synthesis increases with phosphate intake. The effect of FGF23 is reduced by the decrease in Klotho protein in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As a result, there is less phosphate excretion and, consequently, an increase in serum FGF23 levels. Several studies have shown that elevated FGF23 levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This is a consequence of the various alterations it causes at this level, including arterial stiffness, increased pulse wave velocity, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac tissue fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, and atherosclerosis, resulting in increased cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms by which FGF23 generates all these alterations are novel and will be discussed in this review. Therapeutic strategies to reduce FGF23 levels include low-phosphate diets, some intestinal phosphate binders, calcimimetics, dialysis therapies, and some other medications that require further research to evaluate their effectiveness.",
