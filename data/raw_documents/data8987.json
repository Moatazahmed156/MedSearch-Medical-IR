    "abstract": "Splenic rupture is a rare and severe condition in neonates. The signs and symptoms are vague and non-specific and are often not recognised before the onset of hypovolaemic shock or death. A 2-day-old infant presented with scrotal ecchymosis, and ultrasonography detected haemorrhage in the scrotal, right inguinal and adrenal regions. Computed tomography demonstrated a peri-splenic haematoma. Haemoglobin (Hb) was 2.79 g/dL and, despite repeated transfusions, the Hb level could not be sustained. Exploratory laparotomy detected a large haematoma in the splenic region, and, because of the uncontrolled haemorrhage, splenectomy was required.",
