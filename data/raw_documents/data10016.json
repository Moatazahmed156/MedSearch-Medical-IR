  "title": "Trends of Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases Attributable to High Sodium Intake From 1990 to 2021 and Projections to 2030: A Population-Based Study.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the temporal trends and distribution characteristics of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden attributable to high sodium intake, while forecasting future shifts by 2030 in this disease burden to inform resource allocation and the development of health policies. We calculated the estimated annual percent change (EAPC) and project future disease burden using the general additive model. Global data for 2021 revealed that the age-standardized mortality rate of CVD attributable to high sodium intake was 20.40 per 100 000 population, and the DALY rate was 437.70 per 100 000 population. By 2030, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania are projected to have the highest age-standardized mortality and DALY rates at 36.8 and 756.33 per 100 000 population, respectively. Concurrently, the GBD super regions Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania are anticipated to exhibit the second smallest reductions in these metrics, with declines of 6.84% and 7.85%, a performance surpassed only by Sub-Saharan Africa, where the respective reductions are projected to be 5.89% and 6.81%. Considering the large population size of Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania, the burden of CVD attributable to high sodium intake is expected to remain the most severe globally. The worldwide burden of CVD attributable to high sodium intake remained significant and displays marked variability across different geographical regions and age groups. Given the disparities in dietary habits and genetic predisposition to sodium sensitivity, it is essential to focus on facilitating tailored interventions aimed at curbing excessive salt intake, thereby alleviating the CVD burden.",
