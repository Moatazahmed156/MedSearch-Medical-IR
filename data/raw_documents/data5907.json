    "abstract": "Ischemic necrosis is a feared complication of acute gastric volvulus, occurring in 11% of patients presenting with the condition and responsible for mortality in 30%. In such cases, there are few well-validated options for surgical reconstruction. We present the case of a 77-year-old woman with intraabdominal mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus with segmental ischemic gastric necrosis who underwent wedge gastrectomy and hand-sewn gastrogastrostomy. She did well postoperatively and experienced no significant gastrointestinal complications. Gastric wedge resection with gastrogastrostomy presents a novel surgical intervention for a rare and highly morbid entity. We hope to add it to the repertoire of surgeons facing acute gastric volvulus complicated by segmental necrosis.",
