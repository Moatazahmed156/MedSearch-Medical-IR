  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in older adults, and both show well-documented sex-specific differences in terms of clinical presentation, prevalence, and progression trajectories. However, the underlying neurobiological substrates that underpin these differences are poorly understood.  We conducted a literature search of PubMed for studies published between January 2000 and May 2025 examining sex differences in neuroimaging and biofluid markers of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and/or DLB. Eligible studies were required to include sex-stratified or sex-interaction analyses in human participants with clinically defined MCI (due to AD or DLB), AD, or DLB. Of a total of 261 articles imported for screening, 63 met inclusion criteria, comprising 50 cross-sectional and 13 longitudinal investigations across biofluid markers ( There is growing evidence that biological sex significantly influences the pathophysiology of AD and DLB as captured by ",
