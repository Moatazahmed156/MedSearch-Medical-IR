  "title": "Cartilage organoids: an emerging platform for novel osteoarthritis therapies.",
  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, multifactorial joint disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration and dysfunction of various joint tissues. Current treatments primarily focus on symptom management, offering limited success in halting cartilage degradation or repairing damaged tissues. Consequently, there is a pressing need for innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at cartilage regeneration and structural repair. Over the past 2 decades, cartilage organoids have emerged as a promising alternative for OA treatment. Due to their unique regenerative properties, cartilage organoids provide a versatile platform for various applications in OA research and therapy, including ",
