    "abstract": "Over a 2-year period, swellings of all 4 eyelid margins developed in a 32-year-old woman and was accompanied by complete loss of eyelashes. An inflammatory dermatologic condition was considered the most likely cause. A full-thickness right lower eyelid biopsy revealed a multinodular lymphoid tumor at the eyelid margin which immunophenotypically and genetically was diagnosed as an extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The mode of presentation of the disease was considered to be most unusual, as was its B cell lineage, since the majority of primary cutaneous lymphomas are of T-cell origin. Systemic workup demonstrated bilateral involvement of the external auditory canals.",
