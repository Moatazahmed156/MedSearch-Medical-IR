  "title": "Association between asthma control and health-related quality of life in severe asthma: a cross-sectional study from KoSAR.",
  "abstract": "Severe asthma (SA) imposes a significant burden on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to quantify HRQoL burden and identify clinical determinants associated with HRQoL impairment in patients with SA. Cross-sectional data were collected from 701 patients (592 with SA, 109 with non-severe asthma (NSA)) in the Korean Severe Asthma Registry (KoSAR). HRQoL was measured using the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) and Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ). Asthma control status was assessed with the Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores. Multivariable and ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with HRQoL. Patients with SA had lower EQ-5D-5L scores than those with NSA (SA: 0.83  Uncontrolled asthma, particularly its impact on daily functioning, was associated with HRQoL impairment in patients with SA. Enhancing asthma control may significantly reduce the disease burden and improve HRQoL in SA.",
