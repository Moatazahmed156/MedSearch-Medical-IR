  "title": "Diaphragmatic curvature analysis using dynamic digital radiography.",
  "abstract": "To investigate area under diaphragm (AUD) obtained by dynamic digital radiography (DDR) for the differentiation between normal subjects and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. This retrospective study included healthy volunteers and COPD patients recruited from 2009 to 2014 at Fukujuji Hospital, who received DDR and pulmonary functional test. AUD was defined as an area under a hemidiaphragm and above the line connecting the ipsilateral costophrenic angle to the top of the hemidiaphragm on DDR image. AUD in full inspiration minus AUD in full expiration (ΔAUD) was also calculated. The diaphragmatic surface was demarcated manually on DDR image to calculate AUD. Three-group comparison of AUD and ΔAUD among normal, mild COPD, and severe COPD subjects was tested with one-way analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparison with Tukey-Kramer method. The diagnostic accuracy of COPD by ΔAUD was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curve. Sixty-eight participants (36 men, 29 COPD patients) were enrolled. AUD in full inspiration was larger in healthy volunteers than in COPD patients (right, p < 0.001; left, p = 0.02). ΔAUD were different in the three-group comparison (right, normal, 208.7 ± 184.6 mm The value of ΔAUD was smaller according to the severity of COPD. ΔAUD can be helpful in distinguishing healthy subjects from COPD patients.",
