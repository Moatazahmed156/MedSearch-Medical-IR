    "abstract": "The liver, spleen, and kidneys are the commonest injured solid organs in blunt and penetrating trauma. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale (OIS) is the most widely accepted system for categorizing traumatic injuries. Grading systems allow clear communication of findings between clinical teams and assign a measurable severity of injury, which directly correlates with morbidity and mortality. The 2018 revised AAST OIS emphasizes reliance on CT for accurate grading; in particular regarding vascular injuries. Dual-Energy CT (DECT) has emerged as a promising tool with multiple clinical applications already demonstrated. In this review article, we summarize the basic principles of CT attenuation to refresh the minds of our readers and we scrutinize DECT's technology as opposed to conventional Single-Energy CT (SECT). This is followed by outlining the benefits of various DECT postprocessing techniques, which authors of this article refer to as the 3Ms (Mapping of Iodine, Material decomposition, and Monoenergetic virtual imaging), in aiding radiologists to confidently assign an OIS as well as problem solve complex injury patterns. In addition, a thorough discussion of changes to the revised AAST OIS focusing on definitions of key terms used in reporting injuries is described.",
