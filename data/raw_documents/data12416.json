  "abstract": "Surgical resection is recommended for operable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while radiotherapy reserved for inoperable patients. Very comorbid patients may receive no treatment at all. Social determinants of health (SDOHs) may influence access to these treatments. We examined how SDOHs affect treatment modality among these patients using a population-based retrospective cohort study using ICES data including adults with stage I NSCLC diagnosed between 2007 and 2023. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between SDOH and treatment received. Of 19,179 patients, 54.4% received only surgery, 15.8% received only radiotherapy, 27.5% received no treatment, and 2.3% received surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery was less likely in patients aged >80 versus <50 (OR 0.07, ",
