  "title": "Hot-water immersion: a (not so) new therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of hypertension?",
  "abstract": "Hypertension affects over 30% of adults worldwide, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. While regular physical activity is a well- established strategy for lowering blood pressure, additional therapeutic approaches may help individuals who struggle to achieve target blood pressure levels. Hot-water immersion is garnering attention due to its potential cardiovascular benefits. Historically practiced for therapeutic and cultural purposes, hot-water immersion induces physiological responses that share key similarities with physical activity. Accumulating evidence suggests that hot- water immersion may contribute to blood pressure reduction. However, while small-scale studies report promising acute and chronic blood pressure lowering effects, critical gaps remain in the literature. This review summarises current evidence on the anti-hypertensive effects of hot-water immersion, outlining key areas for future research. Hot-water immersion may emerge as an accessible and culturally relevant adjunct therapy for hypertension management.",
