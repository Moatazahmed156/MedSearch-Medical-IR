  "title": "Evidence for neuroprotection by Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050 via synaptic plasticity and oxidative balance in Alzheimer's disease.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, synaptic impairment, and oxidative stress. Probiotics with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been proposed as potential adjunctive strategies. This study examined whether oral administration of Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050 could attenuate hippocampal oxidative stress, modulate synaptic plasticity, and influence spatial working memory in an Aβ",
