    "abstract": "Among all cancer-related death, prostate cancer accounts for the second prominent reason for cancer-associated death in men. Despite the castration mediated reduction in testosterone synthesis, adrenal glands, as well as tissues of prostate cancer, continue to produce androgens, which ultimately lead to the growth of prostate cancer. This phase is referred as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which throws an obstacle to treatment. Androgen antagonists, in addition to deprivation of hormone, is being used for reducing the level of prostate-specific antigen but has not successfully come in front as a choice for prolonging the life of patients suffering from prostate cancer. In this prevailing scenario, abiraterone acetate (AA) has proved to be a boon for patients suffering from prostate cancer. AA selectively inhibits the actions of enzymes C17, 20-lyase and 17α-hydroxylase on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 17 when administered orally. The signaling of androgen receptor, being important for primary to metastatic phases of prostate cancer, CYP17 is essential for the synthesis of androgen. Herein, the in-detail pharmacological profile of AA, including androgen signaling, mechanism of action of AA, mechanism of AA resistance, pharmacokinetics, latest clinical findings, predictive markers, optimal treatment sequence, toxicity, and food interaction profiles have been reviewed.",
