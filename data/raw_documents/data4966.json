    "abstract": "Prostate carcinoma is a growing concern in our aging society. While the disease often follows a indolent course, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males. Prostate cancer screening is promising but remains unproven and controversial. The therapy of prostate cancer has changed little over the past 10 years. The tumor remains refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. True containment of this disease will require novel strategies of diagnosis, biologic assessment, and therapy.",
