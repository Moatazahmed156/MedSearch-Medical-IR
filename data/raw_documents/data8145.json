    "abstract": "Pediatric spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare but devastating group of processes affecting children and their families. Following an initial event, many secondary health conditions (SHC) predictably develop and change over time that require management. We discuss many of these SHC in the context of pediatric SCI. The transitions to home, school, and adulthood play critical roles in wellness for this population and are uniquely discussed in this review of care following pediatric SCI.",
