  "title": "Remnant Cholesterol as a Predictor of No-Reflow Phenomenon in Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.",
  "abstract": "Remnant cholesterol (RC) has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the impact of RC levels on the occurrence of no-reflow in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) remains poorly understood. Patients were classified into 2 groups: those (n = 90) who developed no-reflow (+) and those (n = 350) who did not develop no-reflow (-). RC was calculated as total cholesterol minus low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). RC (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.28, ",
