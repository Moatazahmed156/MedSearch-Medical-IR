  "abstract": "Lung disease is variable among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and depends on genetic and environmental factors. To better understand the molecular determinants of lung disease variability, we carried out an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in sputum samples from patients with CF. We profiled 64 sputum samples using Human Methylation EPIC BeadChips and assessed the correlation between DNA methylation levels and four clinical traits: lung function (FEV1 In the EWAS, we identified two differentially methylated CpG sites (cg11047325/SOCS3, p = 4 × 10 We provide the first longitudinal assessment of genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of patient with CF and identify CpG sites that predict clinical traits of key importance for lung disease. The associated genes play a critical role in inflammation or pancreatic endocrine activity. Overall, our results underscore the emerging role of DNA methylation as a key modulator of disease severity in CF.",
