    "abstract": "Mechanisms sustaining atrial fibrillation are yet to be clarified. This article focuses on milestones in the theory of atrial fibrillation and addresses the different leading hypotheses concerning atrial fibrillation mechanisms. We start off with electric potential originating from the pulmonary vein, which triggers atrial fibrillation, discuss classic activation mapping and phase mapping as well as computer models, which have contributed to the our understanding of atrial fibrillation, and end with new mapping methods and studies highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of current mechanistic hypotheses. The technical evolution of mapping atrial fibrillation has led to new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation. A comparison between methods is essential for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each method when mapping atrial fibrillation. Ultimately, the combination of several methods might shed light on the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and lead to a better understanding of atrial fibrillation and subsequently improve treatment of this condition.",
