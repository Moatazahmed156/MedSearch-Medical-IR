  "title": "Stunting Increases Influenza Virus Shedding Duration in Preschool/School-Aged Children.",
  "abstract": "The role of under-nutrition on influenza virus shedding is unclear. We assessed stunting, an indicator of chronic under-nutrition, as a predictor of shedding duration in children in the Household Influenza Cohort Study, in Managua, Nicaragua. Stunted children, aged 3-9 years, shed influenza longer than their non-stunted peers. In sub-group analysis, associations were driven by H3N2 and influenza B (IB) infections. Analysis of cycle threshold (Ct) values showed slower clearance of IB viruses in stunted children. These findings suggest under-nutrition may prolong influenza shedding, with implications for transmission dynamics and control strategies in low- and middle-income countries where stunting remains prevalent.",
