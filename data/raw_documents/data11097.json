  "abstract": "This study aims to observe the protective effects of the water extract of  HPLC quantified WEPT constituents. COPD mice models established via chronic smoke exposure underwent WEPT treatment, and the therapeutic effect was evaluated by lung function test, histopathology and cytokine profiling. Integrated multi-omics analyses (network pharmacology, transcriptomics, microbiomics) identified bioactive compounds, therapeutic targets, pathway regulations, and microbiota dynamics. Molecular docking validated compound-target interactions, while immunohistochemical/fluorescence assays confirmed key protein expression in lung tissues. WEPT administration effectively reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in COPD mice, improved lung function, and alleviated histopathological damage like alveolar structural injury and airway inflammation. Network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses identified Norhyoscyamine and Onjixanthone I as key active components, targeting PIK3CA and AKT1 via PI3K-AKT pathway regulation. Microbiome analysis showed WEPT restored gut microbiota balance. Molecular docking confirmed strong binding of bioactive compounds to core targets, while immunostaining assays demonstrated WEPT suppressed p-PI3K and p-AKT protein expression. WEPT may exert its intervention effects on COPD through a multi-target and multi-level comprehensive regulatory mechanism.",
