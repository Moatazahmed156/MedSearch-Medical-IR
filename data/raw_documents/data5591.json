    "abstract": "Systematic reviews offer radiologists a comprehensive synthesis of all relevant evidence pertaining to a specific question, aiding them in shaping their clinical practices. It is crucial for radiologists to familiarize themselves with the methods used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses and to understand the limitations. By doing so, they can effectively appraise and interpret results, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the evidence provided in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.",
