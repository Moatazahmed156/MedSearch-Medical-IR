  "abstract": "Current guidelines for the evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not recommend screening for pulmonary hypertension (PH), despite the high prevalence and impact on outcomes. A simple screening tool to identify patients with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is urgently needed, as they may benefit from PH-specific therapy and more urgent referral for lung transplantation. We sought to examine whether a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV Individuals with COPD who underwent right heart catheterisation from two academic medical centres were included. Adjusted multinomial models tested associations between FEV Approximately 40% of the 411 individuals included had PH with an elevated PVR. For every 0.1 increase in the FEV These findings suggest that disproportionate reductions in DLCO predict PH with an elevated PVR in a COPD population. The FEV",
