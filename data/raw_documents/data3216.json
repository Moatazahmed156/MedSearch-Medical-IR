    "abstract": "This case report describes a 15-year-old female who presented with acute onset of painful genital ulcers. She denied being sexually active and tested positive for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 five days prior. Associated symptoms on days 1 to 3 included fatigue, nausea, headaches, and fever. Lipschutz ulcers (LUs), also known as aphthous ulcers, acute genital ulcers, and acquired genital ulcerations; are an uncommon, self-limiting, nonsexually transmitted condition characterized by the rapid onset of painful, necrotic ulcerations of the vulva or lower vagina. The pathogenesis of LUs is unclear, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion.",
