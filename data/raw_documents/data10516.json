  "abstract": "The presence of eosinophils in the lung is a decisive pathophysiological feature of asthma. Some severe asthma patients have persistent eosinophil infiltration in the lung despite receiving high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. Previous studies indicate an association between glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) expression and the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids. Whether there is a correlation between eosinophilic inflammation and GLCCI1 deficiency remains to be discussed. Wild-type (WT) and GLCCI1-deficient (GLCCI1",
