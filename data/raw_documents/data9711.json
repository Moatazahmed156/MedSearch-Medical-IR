  "title": "Olfr2 Promotes Recruitment of Monocytes via CX3CR1 in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.",
  "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are characterized by ECM (extracellular matrix) degradation and chronic vascular inflammation, with macrophages playing a key role. The mechanisms regulating macrophage activation in AAA remain incompletely understood. Vascular macrophages express Olfr2 (olfactory receptor 2), a GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) implicated in inflammation, but its role in AAA development is unknown. We investigated the role of Olfr2 in AAA using PPE (porcine pancreatic elastase) infusion in Olfr2-deficient ( Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of the human Olfr2 orthologue OR6A2 in AAA tissue. Flow cytometry showed OR6A2 upregulation in monocytes from patients with large versus small AAAs. In both human and murine tissues, up to 30% of vascular macrophages expressed OR6A2/Olfr2, which peaked in MHCII Olfr2 regulates monocyte recruitment and macrophage-driven inflammation during AAA. Its genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition protects against AAA, whereas receptor activation worsens the disease. Olfr2 represents a critical modulator of vascular inflammation and a potential therapeutic target in AAA.",
