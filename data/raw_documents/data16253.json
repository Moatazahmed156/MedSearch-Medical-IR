  "title": "Viral Vaccines as an Alternative to Antimicrobials: A Perspective from Swine Veterinarians on Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Directions.",
  "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing concern in food animal production. In swine herds, viral infections often lead to secondary bacterial disease and higher antimicrobial use (AMU). This study describes how U.S. swine veterinarians view the role of viral vaccines in reducing this reliance on antimicrobials. We conducted a national survey of swine practitioners and follow-up semi-structured interviews with a subset of respondents. Across participants, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), swine influenza (SIV), and rotaviral enteritis were most often named as viral diseases in urgent need of improved vaccines. These diseases cause substantial economic losses and frequently trigger AMU in commercial herds. Veterinarians reported several recurring challenges with current vaccines, including limited cross-protection against field strains, interference from maternally derived antibodies, and short duration of protection. Despite these limitations, most respondents supported vaccination as a key tool to curb AMU and indicated they would accept higher prices for clearly improved products. These findings reveal both a clear need and specific opportunities for future vaccine development to provide broader and more reliable protection, reduce AMU, and help slow the development of AMR.",
