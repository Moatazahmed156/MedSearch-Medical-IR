    "abstract": "Biochemical integrity of the brain is vital for normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). One of the factors contributing to cerebral biochemical impairment is a chemical process called oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs upon excessive free radical production resulting from an insufficiency of the counteracting antioxidant response system. The brain, with its high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich content, is highly susceptible to oxidative stress. Therefore, oxidative stress-induced damage to the brain has a strong potential to negatively impact normal CNS functions. Although oxidative stress has historically been considered to be involved mainly in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease, its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression, is beginning to be recognized. This review is a discussion of the relevance of cerebral oxidative stress to impairment of emotional and mental well-being.",
