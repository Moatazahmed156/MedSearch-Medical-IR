  "title": "Profiles and Influencing Factors for Self-Regulatory Fatigue in Patients with Colorectal Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Self-regulated fatigue (SRF) can seriously damage the physical and mental health of persons with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergoing chemotherapy. Understanding how to improve self-regulation ability is of crucial importance. To investigate the status of potential profiles of SRF in persons with CRC treated with chemotherapy and the factors associated with these profiles. A convenience sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey with 322 hospitalized persons with CRC who were undergoing chemotherapy at three tertiary-grade A hospitals in China. Data were collected through the General Information, Self-Regulatory Fatigue Scale, Family Health Scale, the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and cancer information overload scale. Latent profile analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to analyze the data. SRF among persons undergoing chemotherapy for CRC could be divided into three potential profiles: low SRF-extensive social profile (53.1%), moderate SRF profile (32.3%), and high SRF-low mood profile (14.6%). Gender, per capita family monthly income, family health, psychological distress, and cancer information overload were predictive factors for different profiles of SRF. There were three latent profiles of SRF in persons with CRC. Family health, psychological distress, and information overload were significant predictors of SRF. Health care providers should adopt individualized interventions to help patients improve disease coping, reduce SRF, and provide support through family care, information filtering, and psychological support.",
