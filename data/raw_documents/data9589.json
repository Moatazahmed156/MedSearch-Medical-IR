  "title": "Diabetes outcomes of patients followed by pharmacists newly embedded in primary care clinics.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early impact of embedded pharmacists on diabetes outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes in the primary care setting. This study assessed pharmacists' impact on quality of care by comparing the diabetes outcomes of patients managed by newly embedded clinical pharmacists to those of patients managed exclusively by providers. A multicenter, observational, retrospective cohort study was conducted examining adults with a diagnosis of diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level above 8%. The primary outcome was the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up 3 to 6 months later. A total of 98 patients were included, with 49 patients in the pharmacist intervention group and 49 patients in the comparator primary care provider group. In the pharmacist group, HbA1c levels decreased by 2.14%, compared to a decrease of 0.15% in the provider group (P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes of the number of telephone encounters, the number of medication adjustments, continuous glucose monitor use, and assistance with medication access had statistically significant differences between the groups. Pharmacists also implemented more evidence-based medications when looking at patient comorbidities. Pharmacist management of type 2 diabetes significantly lowered HbA1c levels. Pharmacists provided closer follow-up allowing for more timely therapeutic adjustments, implemented additional evidence-based medications, assisted with medication access or barriers, and increased use of continuous glucose monitors more than primary care providers alone.",
