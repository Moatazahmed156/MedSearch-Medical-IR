    "abstract": "Gene expression analysis by microarray and more recently by next-generation sequencing has become a core part of biomedical research and its value can be seen in thousands of research papers. A successful gene expression experiment needs to be augmented by specialized data mining techniques if the data are to be fully exploited. Here, tools that concentrate on three areas-gene enrichment analysis, literature mining, and transcription factor binding site analysis-are described for the novice user of microarray and next generation sequencing technologies. The focus of this chapter is on free, publicly available, web-based tools.",
