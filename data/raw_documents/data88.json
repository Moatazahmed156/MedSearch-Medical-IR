    "abstract": "The purpose of this systemic literature review is to unveil a greater understanding of Physical Activity in Latinas. We used PubMed and PsycInfo databases to search for articles published between 1991 and August 2016, examining physical activity and its correlates exclusively in adult Latinas. Only 21 primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Although physical activity derives from body movements in various domains, the leisure domain led the focus of research interest. The use of self-reports, cross-sectional design, and the ecological framework predominated. Only one study included examining the occupational domain, albeit as disaggregate in studies with a general physical activity approach. Occupational physical activity showed negative associations with education and acculturation. Positive associations were found between leisure-time physical activity, education, acculturation, and perceived health status. Despite the limited evidence to reach overall conclusions, this review uncovered methodological challenges and opportunities to advance knowledge about physical activity in Latinas.",
