  "title": "Echocardiographic Results of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Women With Severe Aortic Stenosis: The RHEIA Trial.",
  "abstract": "In the RHEIA (Randomized Research in Women All Comers With Aortic Stenosis) trial, the incidence of the primary end point of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year was lower with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) than with surgical aortic valve replacement. The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI. At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory. Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (<1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%;  Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.
