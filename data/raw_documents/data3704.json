    "abstract": "As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide, there is an enhanced need for effective disease management. Type 2 diabetes is managed through a stepwise program of intensive therapy that consists of lifestyle modifications and sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic agents and insulin as necessary. Successful implementation of this approach lessens the microvascular complications of the disease and promotes a lifestyle that may reduce macrovascular complications and comorbidities. Because of the progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure that causes hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, many people with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require insulin for disease management. Insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral agents to achieve glycemic control with a minimum of side effects. Although disease management regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual with type 2 diabetes, the health care provider should always employ an aggressive, treat-to-target strategy to lower hyperglycemia and lessen diabetes-related risk factors.",
