  "abstract": "Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) occurs in the salivary glands, but pulmonary EMC (P-EMC) is an extremely rare histological type. Here, we report a case of effective thoracoscopic lung reduction for P-EMC. A woman in her 80s was referred to our hospital following detection of an abnormal shadow on a chest CT performed during an annual lung cancer screening programme. The mass was 11 mm in the right lower lobe, and 11 mm and 5 mm multiple nodules were identified in the left lower lobe. A thoracoscopic partial right lung resection was performed for diagnosis and treatment, and the patient was diagnosed with P-EMC. After a follow-up of approximately 2 years, a left basal segmentectomy and lymph node dissection by complete video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were performed. The final pathology revealed a P-EMC.",
