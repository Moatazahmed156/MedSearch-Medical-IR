  "title": "Sex Disparities in Mortality Outcomes Among COPD Patients Awaiting Lung Transplantation: A Comprehensive Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Lung transplantation (LT) is a viable option for end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients when conventional treatments fail. However, sex disparities in mortality outcomes among COPD patients awaiting LT remain understudied. LT waiting lists are generally shorter in Western countries compared to Israel. To evaluate sex-specific differences in mortality and co-morbidities among COPD patients awaiting lung transplantation, to identify key risk factors influencing survival. We assessed associations between sex, co-morbidities, exacerbations, and mortality using Cox regression models, adjusting for confounders. Survival curves for lung transplant candidates were stratified by sex using Fine and Gray models. We identified 385 COPD patients listed for LT at Rabin Medical Center. Females exhibited higher rates of asthma (P = 0.008), anxiety (P = 0.005), and depression (P = 0.002); males were more frequently diagnosed with ischemic heart disease (26.5% vs. 10.83%, P = 0.001) and had a higher lung transplant rate (24.9% vs. 15%, P = 0.029). Multivariate analysis revealed that female sex (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.06-2.29, P = 0.025), older age (HR 1.02, 95%CI 1.002-1.054, P = 0.035), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.12-2.48, P = 0.011), and depression (HR 1.81, 95%CI 1.15-2.83, P < 0.01) were significantly associated with increased mortality. Females showed higher 1-year mortality rates than males (40.3% vs. 29.8%, P < 0.001). Female sex is a significant risk factor for increased mortality among COPD patients awaiting LT, likely due to a higher burden of co-morbidities.",
