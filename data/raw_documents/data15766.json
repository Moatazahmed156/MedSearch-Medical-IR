  "title": "Physicochemical Characterisation of Ceftobiprole and Investigation of the Biological Properties of Its Cyclodextrin-Based Delivery System.",
  "abstract": "Ceftobiprole is a novel and promising antibiotic; however, the direct pharmacological use of its native form is limited by its low water solubility. The first part of this study provides a deeper insight into the physicochemical properties of this drug. One- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra in D",
