    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine whether differences exist in the rates of obstetric intervention between women with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes, and whether there has been any change in cesarean rates over time, paralleling that seen in the general obstetric population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were examined from a prospectively collected series on the outcomes of 1030 deliveries (382 by women with type 1 diabetes, 648 by women with type 2 diabetes) from 1988 to 2008.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There was a secular trend to increasing maternal age (type 1, P < 0.003; type 2, P < 0.03). Intervention rates (induction of labor or elective cesarean) did not differ between type 1 (88%) and type 2 (85%) diabetes. The overall cesarean rate was 52%-55% with no secular trend. Poorer glycemic control in early pregnancy and primiparity were associated with primary cesarean in both groups. In women with type 1 diabetes, greater maternal obesity and retinopathy were also associated with primary cesarean.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Intervention rates are high in pregnancies among women with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes but they have not changed significantly. Secular trends toward increasing maternal age and obesity suggest that intervention rates are unlikely to decrease in the near future.",
