    "abstract": "OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONSGlobalization and eCommerce continue to fuel unprecedented growth in the logistics and warehousing markets. Simultaneously, the biggest bottleneck for these industries is their human capital. Where automation and robotic solutions fail to deliver a return on investment, humans frequently take over handling tasks that place harmful loads and strains on the body. Occupational exoskeletons can reduce fatigue and strain by supporting the lower spine and are designed to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders and other injuries. They are a mid- to long-term investment for industries to improve ergonomic conditions in workplaces, with the potential for reducing absences from work, sick days logged, and workers compensation claims. To examine the effectiveness of the newly introduced Paexo Back exoskeleton, a study was completed with 10 participants who completed manual load handling tasks with and without the exoskeleton. Key findings include significant reductions in metabolic effort and low back loading when the exoskeleton is worn.",
