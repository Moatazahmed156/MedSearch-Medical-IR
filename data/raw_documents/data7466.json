    "abstract": "Breast cancer is by far the most common malignancy in women. The median age is 64 years. Stage at diagnosis and biological features determine the prognosis. Patients with early breast cancer, with locally advanced disease and with locoregional relapse can be cured. Modern treatment is multimodal. It includes surgery, radiation and drug therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are treated with palliative intent. Aims are alleviation of symptoms and prolongation of survival. Breast cancer specific mortality has continually decreased in the past 10 years. Five year survival rate is 87% in Germany. Patients with early breast cancer have an even higher chance of cure.",
