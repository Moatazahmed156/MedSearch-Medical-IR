  "title": "Quality and Quantity? The Clinical Significance of Myosteatosis in Various Liver Diseases: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Myosteatosis is associated with poor outcomes in various liver diseases. However, standardized methods for assessing, defining, and diagnosing myosteatosis in the context of liver diseases remain unclear. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms by which myosteatosis leads to pathophysiological progression and adverse health outcomes remain elusive. Therefore, in this review, we elaborate on the currently available measures, definitions, and diagnostic criteria of myosteatosis in the existing literature. We thoroughly clarify the recent evidence and data regarding the possible involvement of myosteatosis in the progression and deterioration of various liver diseases and resulting complications, including liver cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic/metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, it synthesizes insights from basic research on the pathogenesis of myosteatosis, which involves multifactorial mechanisms, including insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Finally, from an operational and pragmatic perspective, several regimens, including physical, nutritional, and pharmacological therapies, have been discussed as potential treatments for myosteatosis.",
