  "abstract": "To investigate the clinical efficacy of azithromycin in treating pediatric mycoplasma pneumonia and its effects on platelet count, D-dimer levels, and serum inflammatory factors. This was a retrospective study. Eighty children with mycoplasma pneumonia admitted to Anhui Children's Hospital between June 2022 to June 2024 were selected as study subjects. They were divided into an observation group(n=40) receiving azithromycin and a control group(n=40) receiving erythromycin according to different treatment strategies. Clinical efficacy, time to resolution of symptoms, platelet count, D-dimer levels, serum inflammatory factor levels, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. The overall response rate of the observation group(95.00%) was significantly higher than that of the control group(72.50%)(χ Azithromycin offers multiple benefits in treating pediatric mycoplasma pneumonia, including rapid symptom resolution, potent anti-inflammatory effects, regulation of coagulation-fibrinolysis balance, reduction in serum inflammatory factor levels, and a lower incidence of adverse reactions.",
