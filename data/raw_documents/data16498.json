  "title": "From pandemics to preparedness: harnessing AI, CRISPR, and synthetic biology to counter biosecurity threats.",
  "abstract": "Biosecurity threats, which include natural outbreaks, laboratory accidents, and intentional bioterrorism, are a major issue for global health security. The impact of poor preparedness on the health, social, and economic effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the 2001 anthrax attacks, and the COVID-19 crisis is devastating. Standard methods, such as quarantine and serology, as well as traditional inoculations, offered basic defences but were often reactive, slow, and unfair. The recent scientific and technological progress has altered the concept of biosecurity preparedness by providing new instruments of early detection, quick reaction, and fair health solutions. Artificial intelligence-based epidemic prediction, next-generation sequencing, CRISPR-based diagnostics, and digital epidemiology are emerging technologies that enable near-real-time surveillance. New therapeutic agents and vaccines, such as mRNA and DNA platforms, monoclonal antibodies, and nanobody therapies, have enhanced response capabilities. Containment measures based on robotics, biosensors, nanotechnology-based PPE, and portable biocontainment units have simultaneously improved frontline safety. Sensitive health information and enhanced coordination are today secured with the help of digital and cyber-biosecurity tools. Nonetheless, the innovations have ethical, legal, and equity issues, which point to the need to govern responsibly and make them accessible to all. This review brings forth the incorporation of emerging technologies with international cooperation, fair systems, and responsive policies as the keys to developing resilient and future-orientated systems that could help alleviate natural, accidental, and intentional biosecurity threats.",
