    "abstract": "Blood-based diagnostics for lung cancer support the diagnosis, estimation of prognosis, prediction, and monitoring of therapy response in lung cancer patients. The clinical utility of serum tumor markers has considerably increased due to developments in serum protein tumor markers analytics and clinical biomarker studies, the exploration of preanalytical and influencing conditions, the interpretation of biomarker combinations and individual biomarker kinetics, as well as the implementation of biostatistical models. In addition, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other liquid biopsy markers are playing an increasingly prominent role in the molecular tumor characterization and the monitoring of tumor evolution over time. Thus, modern lung cancer biomarkers may considerably contribute to an individualized companion diagnostics and provide a sensitive guidance for patients throughout the course of their disease. In this special edition on Tumor Markers in Lung Cancer, experts summarize recent developments in clinical laboratory diagnostics of lung cancer and give an outlook on future challenges and opportunities.",
