    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition, is characterized by the slow and progressive deterioration of the cognitive functions of geriatric patients. It occurs due to exacerbation of neurons in the brain, indicated by loss of memory, mood instability, and even death. The aggregation of amyloid β protein and neurofibrillary tangles-atypical forms of tau protein is the major cause of this disease. Phytoconstituents have been frequently employed in treating Alzheimer's disease. These natural compounds act through different molecular mechanisms to treat the disease. However, their potential in Alzheimer's disease therapy may be limited due to poor blood-brain barrier permeability, off-target effects, low bioavailability, etc. In recent times, nanotechnology has gained attraction to overcome these challenges. This article focuses on the potential phytoconstituents for Alzheimer's disease treatment and the associated limitations. Moreover, it highlights various nanoformulation strategies employed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, avoid side effects, improve bioavailability, and target specificity in treating Alzheimer's disease. The integration of nanotechnology with plant-derived compounds has the potential to revolutionize the therapeutic landscape for Alzheimer's disease.",
