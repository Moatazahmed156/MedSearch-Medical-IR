    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex but a fine-tuned biological process in which human skin has the ability to regenerate itself following damage. However, in particular conditions such as deep burn or diabetes the process of wound healing is compromised. Despite investigations on the potency of a wide variety of stem cells for wound healing, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) seem to possess the least limitations for clinical applications, and literature showed that ASCs can improve the process of wound healing very likely by promoting angiogenesis and/or vascularisation, modulating immune response, and inducing epithelialization in the wound. In the present review, advantages and disadvantages of various stem cells which can be used for promoting wound healing are discussed. In addition, potential mechanisms of action by which ASCs may accelerate wound healing are summarised. Finally, clinical studies applying ASCs for wound healing and the associated limitations are reviewed.",
