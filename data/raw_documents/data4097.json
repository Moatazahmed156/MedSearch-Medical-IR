    "abstract": "We present a case report on a case of invasive apocrine carcinoma of breast during pregnancy at a tertiary referral hospital in Ethiopia. The patient's case in this report signifies the challenging clinical situation that the patient, developing fetus and treating physicians have to go through and the need to improve maternal-fetal medicine and oncologic setup and treatment guidelines in Ethiopia. Our case also illustrates the huge disparity between the management of both breast cancer and its occurrence during pregnancy in low-income countries like Ethiopia and developed nations elsewhere. Our case report shows a rare histological finding. The patient has invasive apocrine carcinoma of the breast. To our knowledge, it is the first case to be reported in the country.",
