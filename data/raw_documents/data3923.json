    "abstract": "In the past few years, intestinal microbiota has emerged as a novel target for the treatment of gut-brain axis alterations. These include functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can be comorbid with stress-related psychiatric conditions. Thus, modulation of the microbiota (e.g. with the use of probiotics) could be proposed as a novel strategy not only for the treatment of IBS but also as an adjuvant for psychiatric treatment of anxiety and depression.",
