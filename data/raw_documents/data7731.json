    "abstract": "Several studies have reported early atherosclerotic changes in arterial wall of young adults, although they usually become symptomatic after age 40 years. Initially, some sporadic and limited data were available to document the atherosclerotic lesions in young adults; early subclinical assessment were later possible using accurate ultrasound and other imaging techniques. Our aim was to a review of eloquent studies proving different type of atherosclerotic lesion in the young adult. Long-term follow-up and further analysis of this population demonstrated important relationship with traditional and some non-traditional, risk factors. The data comprised in the reviewed studies are arguments in favor of a more refined atherosclerotic risk assessment and appropriate preventive strategy in young adult.",
