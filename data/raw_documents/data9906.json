  "title": "Leveraging Vascular Over Ventricular Ratios in Observational Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension and Acute Pulmonary Embolism Cohorts to Decode Clot Chronicity on Computed Tomography Angiography.",
  "abstract": "This study evaluates the utility of CT-derived PA/A and RV/LV ratios in distinguishing surgically accessible CTEPH from acute PE and negative controls. Unlike the RV/LV ratio, PA/A ratio was significantly higher in CTEPH patients compared to low and intermediate/high-risk acute PE cohorts, indicating its utility as a marker of clot chronicity.",
