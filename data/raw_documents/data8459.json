    "abstract": "Apremilast is a relatively new therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. While this medication is considered safe with a very low risk of serious side effects, a few common (≥5% of patients) mild to moderate side effects have been reported, including diarrhea, nausea, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Not addressing these symptoms may lead to medication nonadherence and unnecessary discontinuation of therapy. These side effects are often easily managed with interventions available to the practicing dermatologist, and in only rare instances will these side effects require dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy. The purpose of this article is to review common side effects of apremilast at its approved dose of 30 mg orally twice daily (BID) and to provide clear, simple recommendations for their management in dermatological practice.",
