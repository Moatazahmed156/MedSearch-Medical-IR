  "title": "Intravascular Imaging-Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Transforming Precision and Outcomes in Contemporary Practice.",
  "abstract": "Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has evolved significantly over the past two decades, yet challenges in achieving optimal stent deployment and long-term outcomes persist, particularly in complex coronary anatomy. Intravascular imaging (IVI) modalities such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have transformed the precision of PCI by providing detailed cross-sectional visualization of vessel architecture, plaque morphology, and stent apposition. Compared to angiography-guided PCI, imaging-guided PCI enables more accurate lesion assessment, appropriate stent sizing, and detection of suboptimal results including under-expansion, malapposition, and edge dissections, factors strongly linked to restenosis and stent thrombosis. Large-scale randomized trials (e.g., ULTIMATE, ILUMIEN) and meta-analyses have demonstrated that imaging-guided PCI reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and improves long-term stent patency, particularly in left main, bifurcation, and calcified lesions. Despite these benefits, adoption remains variable due to cost, procedural complexity, and training gaps. Emerging advances, including artificial intelligence-enhanced imaging, hybrid devices, and fusion of imaging with physiologic assessments, promise to integrate imaging more seamlessly into routine practice. This review summarizes current evidence, practical applications, and future directions of IVI-guided PCI, underscoring its growing role in contemporary interventional cardiology and its potential to personalize and optimize coronary revascularization strategies.",
