  "title": "Activated T cells degrade extracellular proteins to enhance effector functions.",
  "abstract": "Proteins are the most abundant source of amino acids in body fluids. However, the potential contribution of extracellular protein catabolism to the regulation of T cell immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that endocytosed extracellular proteins function as an amino acid source in activated T cells, maintaining mTORC1 activity and sustaining cytokine production following T cell activation. Genetic ablation of Tfe3 impairs the activation-induced upregulation of lysosomal genes and disrupts extracellular protein catabolism, resulting in attenuated mTORC1 signaling and compromised anti-viral and anti-tumor T cell responses. The TFE3-protein-mTORC1 signaling axis demonstrates clinical relevance. CD8",
