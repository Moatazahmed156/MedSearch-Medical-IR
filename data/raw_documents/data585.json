    "abstract": "In order to see the patients with low back pain and/or sciatica, it is most important to consider the pathophysiology of symptoms. We should know that the image findings such as X-ray and MRI do not always show the cause of symptom. Because degenerative changes in lumbar spine are common findings in asymptomatic group compared to symptomatic patients with low back pain and sciatica. According to pathophysiology (nerve root syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, facet syndrome, discogenic pain syndrome and intermittent claudication for low back pain), the treatment for low back pain and sciatica were described.",
