    "abstract": "The majority of patients with cancer are adults aged 65 years or older. Despite this, their special needs are generally under-recognized and under-researched. This includes the lack of awareness about scams targeting vulnerable older adults. The purpose of this article is to share knowledge and resources about financial exploitation of patients aged 65 years or older. Enhanced recognition of this phenomenon can facilitate oncology nurses' early identification and interventions for at-risk older adult populations.",
