    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. Cardiometabolic and genetic risk factors play an important role in the trajectory of AD. Cardiometabolic risk factors including diabetes, mid-life obesity, mid-life hypertension and elevated cholesterol have been linked with cognitive decline in AD subjects. These potential risk factors associated with cerebral metabolic changes which fuel AD pathogenesis have been suggested to be the reason for the disappointing clinical trial results. In appreciation of the risks involved, using search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE and Google Scholar, a relevant literature search on cardiometabolic and genetic risk factors in AD was conducted. We discuss the role of genetic as well as established cardiovascular risk factors in the neuropathology of AD. Moreover, we show new evidence of genetic interaction between several genes potentially involved in different pathways related to both neurodegenerative process and cardiovascular damage.",
