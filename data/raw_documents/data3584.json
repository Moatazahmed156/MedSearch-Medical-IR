    "abstract": "Zika virus was first isolated in 1947 from an exotic rhesus macaque. Nearly 70 years later, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas and its newly described association with birth defects has motivated the development of captive macaque monkey models of human Zika virus infection. This review describes similarities between macaque and human Zika virus pathogenesis and discusses specific advantages and disadvantages of using macaques instead of other laboratory animal models. In particular, macaques provide an outstanding model for understanding in utero Zika virus infections that are essential for evaluating preclinical interventions for use in pregnancy.",
