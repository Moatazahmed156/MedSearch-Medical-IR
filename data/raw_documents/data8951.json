    "abstract": "Factor X deficiency (FXD) is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with a variable phenotypic severity. In women, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), recurrent ovulation bleeding with haemoperitoneum and bleeding complications in pregnancy such as retroplacental haematoma and postpartum haemorrhage have been reported. The aim of this review was to examine gynaecological problems and obstetric complications in women with congenital FXD. A total number of 49 relevant articles were identified, including 332 women, dating from 1960 to 2018. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported in 72/284 (25%) women in total, 14/30 (47%) in case reports and 58/254 (23%) in 11 case series, 64% and 10% required blood products and blood transfusion, respectively. Haemoperitoneum from ovulation bleeding or ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst requiring blood transfusion occurred in 8/322 (2.4%) women, six required surgical intervention, including oophorectomy in two. 31 pregnancies were reported in 19 women. There were four miscarriages (including a late miscarriage at 21 weeks). There was a high rate of preterm birth and neonatal death occurring in eight (30%) and three (11%) of pregnancies reaching viability stage. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) occurred in six (22%) of deliveries, one requiring hysterectomy. In conclusion, women with FXD are at an increased risk of heavy bleeding during menstruation and ovulation as well as adverse pregnancy outcome and postpartum haemorrhage. Collaboration in a multidisciplinary team including an obstetrician/gynaecologist, a perinatologist and a haematologist is necessary for the prevention and management of these complications.",
