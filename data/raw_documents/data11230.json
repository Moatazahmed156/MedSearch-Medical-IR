  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a deficiency within the lungs of regulatory T cells and an excess of Th17 cells, termed T17/Treg imbalance. Conventional dendritic cells type-1 (cDC1) and type-2 (cDC2) are known to drive Treg and Th17 polarization, respectively, but their roles in COPD are incompletely understood. Using a murine cigarette smoke (CS)-exposure model, we found that after 8 wk of CS exposure, the percentage of lung cDC1, but not cDC2, was significantly decreased (",
