  "abstract": "Research indicates that low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) can effectively mitigate Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms by promoting Treg cells, while high doses may enhance immune responses and exacerbate the disease. Consequently, this study employed mutated IL-2 to minimize its impact on CD8 We used a previously published mutation sites to construct the murine IL-2 mutants by overlap PCR. Then we assessed its impact on the proliferation and functionality of Treg cells by flow cytometry and PCR. The synergistic effects of mutated IL-2 and MSC on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice were evaluated through the infusion of lentiviral-transduced umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (UC-MSC) for CIA treatment and through pathological section staining to assess inflammatory joint injury, cartilage destruction, and osteoclast infiltration. Mutant IL-2 demonstrated targeted enhancement of both the proportion and proliferative activity of Treg cells with a diminished capacity to stimulate the proliferation of CD8 Mutant IL-2 enhances Treg function and proliferation while exerting reduced effects on CD8",
