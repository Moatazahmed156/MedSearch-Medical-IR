  "title": "The clinical and financial impact of new-onset atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass grafting: From indexed procedure to long-term follow-up.",
  "abstract": "New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is common. Additional information regarding long-term clinical and financial outcomes is important. This statewide analysis compares periprocedural and long-term outcomes between patients with and without POAF. Data on patients who underwent isolated CABG from 2013 to 2021 without atrial fibrillation (AF) history from a statewide Society of Thoracic Surgeons database (N = 18,377) were merged with the state health services database. Patients with POAF (n = 4656) were compared with those without POAF (n = 13,721). Outcomes were incidence and cost of readmissions, examined with χ The incidence of POAF was 25% (male = 26% vs female = 24%,  POAF remains common after CABG, with greater cost and risk-adjusted morbidity reported. Follow-up data reveal a significant number of patients continue to be impacted by AF. This study suggests targeted discharge planning and surveillance for patients with POAF to improve long-term outcomes and reduce cost of complications.",
