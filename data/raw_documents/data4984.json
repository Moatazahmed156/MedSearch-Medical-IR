    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is common among men in the United States. Factors of possible importance in the etiology of prostate cancer include diet, primarily implicated by ecologic studies of national, regional, and ethnic variation in rates; endocrine function, implicated by the importance of endocrine function in normal prostatic growth and in the treatment of prostate cancer; genetic susceptibility, supported by familial aggregation; some aspect of sexual behavior, suggested by case-control differences in sexual behavior; and occupational exposure, particularly cadmium exposure. Despite the public health importance of prostate cancer, it has received only moderate epidemiologic study; thus the etiologic importance of these and other possible determinants of prostate cancer risk is uncertain [55].",
