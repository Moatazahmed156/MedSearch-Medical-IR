    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancers in developed countries. Many of the mechanisms involved in its initiation and progression remain unclear. Analysis providing comprehensive data on the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome could help in selecting molecular markers and targets in endometrial cancer. Multiomics approaches can reveal disturbances in multiple biological systems, giving a broader picture of the problem. However, they provide a large amount of data that require processing and further integration prior to analysis. There are several repositories of multiomics datasets, including endometrial cancer data, as well as portals allowing multiomics data analysis and visualization, including Oncomine, UALCAN, LinkedOmics, and miRDB. Multiomics approaches have also been applied in endometrial cancer research in order to identify novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets. This review describes in detail the latest findings on multiomics approaches in endometrial cancer.",
