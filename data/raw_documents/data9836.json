  "title": "Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Management of Liver Diseases.",
  "abstract": "This review explores the evolving role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases, with a particular focus on chronic liver disease, focal hepatic lesions, portal hypertension, and post-transplant anatomy. A comprehensive literature review of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase studies up to August 2025 was conducted to identify the latest evidence on EUS-guided procedures, comparing them with traditional techniques. In diagnostics, EUS-guided liver biopsy provides real-time visualisation and precise tissue sampling, achieving longer specimen lengths and better patient outcomes compared to traditional percutaneous and transjugular approaches. For portal hypertension assessment, EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement is a promising alternative to conventional methods, with validation studies demonstrating strong correlation with hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements. In therapeutic applications, EUS facilitates precise interventions including gastric variceal treatment through combined coil and glue injection, management of visceral arterial pseudoaneurysms, selective portal vein embolisation, and targeted tumour ablation. While some applications remain in developmental stages, studies support the safety and efficacy of EUS in improving diagnostic accuracy and expanding therapeutic options for liver diseases. Ongoing technological advances in needle design, imaging capabilities, and artificial intelligence integration are expected to further enhance the utility of EUS in hepatology.",
