  "title": "From Diagnosis to Delivery: A Look at the Continuing Gap in Maternal Testing.",
  "abstract": "Hypertension, infection, hemorrhage, cardiovascular events, gestational diabetes, anemia, and miscarriage remain the primary cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Despite advances in maternal health, there remains a gap in the ability to accurately diagnose, or predict the risk of, certain pregnancy-related conditions. Here, we discuss preterm delivery, preeclampsia, ectopic pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and detection of fetal anomalies. These are 5 examples of pregnancy-related conditions for which a significant diagnostic gap still exists. We note that many of the available tests used in this field promote a high negative predictive value (NPV), when tests with high positive predictive value (PPV) are needed to drive treatment. To improve the modes of maternal testing, researchers need to establish the performance criteria necessary for the given condition. For low-prevalence conditions with potentially catastrophic outcomes, a single test needs extremely high sensitivity and specificity to achieve the PPV required to identify the small number of affected women who would benefit from intensive intervention. Alternatively, 2-step approaches could be used with a highly sensitive screen followed by a highly specific test. However, the solution to improving maternal morbidity and mortality is 2-fold: both affordable, effective, and rapid modes of testing; and safer, more effective treatments are needed.",
