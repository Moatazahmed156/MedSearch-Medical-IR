  "title": "A new phenolic acid isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza ameliorates OVA-induced allergic asthma by regulation of Th17/Treg cells and inflammation through the TLR4 pathway.",
  "abstract": "Salvia miltiorrhiza (S. miltiorrhiza) represents a crucial component of traditional Chinese medicine, demonstrating effects on blood circulation activation and stasis removal, and has been widely utilized in asthma treatment. This study isolated a novel phenolic acid (S1) from S. miltiorrhiza and investigated its anti-asthmatic activity and underlying mechanisms for the first time. An allergic asthma (AA) model was established using ovalbumin (OVA). The mechanism of S1's effects on AA was investigated using multi-factor joint analysis, flow cytometry, and co-culture systems to facilitate clinical asthma treatment. S1 (10 or 20 mg·kg",
