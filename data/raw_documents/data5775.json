    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of hypertension in adolescents and young adults has increased in part due to the obesity epidemic. The clinical impact and future cardiovascular risk of this underestimated public health problem is an evolving field.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      The development of hypertension is predicted by tracking of elevated blood pressure from childhood to adulthood. Young hypertensive individuals have lower awareness, slower diagnosis rates, and poorer blood pressure control than older patients. Increased awareness, appropriate screening, early identification, and individualized treatment approaches for elevated blood pressure could prevent development of hypertension in adulthood and cardiovascular events in later life. The optimal blood pressure management for young adults with a low 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of < 10% remains challenging due to lack of randomized controlled trials. Evidence-based recommendations are needed to implement appropriate measures for time of treatment initiation, preferred antihypertensive drug class to be used and optimal target blood pressure level from childhood through young adulthood.",
