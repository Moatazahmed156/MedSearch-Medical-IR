    "abstract": "Both risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and of BD in patients with T2DM are both significantly higher than the general population, indicating the two disorders may share the common pathogenesis. Patients with BD and co-morbid T2DM behave poorly on managing their own behavior on health, thus increased risks of outcomes on related complications, disability and mortality. The article reviewed the epidemiologic features, health hazards, relations and possible mechanisms between BD and T2DM. Strategies and measures on intervention of BD and T2DM were also involved in the text to improve the awareness and research ability of the researchers.",
