    "abstract": "Stroke causes disability and high mortality, while it can be prevented by increasing public awareness of risk factors. The common known risk factors are hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, smoking, alcohol consumption, low physical activity, overweight and hypercholesterolemia. However, the deep understanding of risk factors is limited. Moreover, more risk factor emerges in recent years. To further increase the awareness of risk factors for stroke prevention, this review indicates the reasonable application of antihypertensive agents according to the age-dependent changes of hypertension, and some new risk factors including chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, migraine with aura, working environment, genetic factors and air pollution. Therefore, internal risk factors (e.g. heredity, hypertension, hyperglycemia) and external risk factors (e.g. working environment, air pollution) are both important for stroke prevention. All of these are reviewed to provide more information for the pre-hospital prevention and management, and the future clinical studies.",
