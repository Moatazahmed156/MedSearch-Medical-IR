    "abstract": "We develop a minimal whole-heart model that describes cardiac electrical conduction and simulate a basic three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We compare our three-lead ECG model with clinical data from a Norwegian athlete database. The results demonstrate a strong correlation with the ECGs recorded for these athletes. We simulate various pathologies of the heart's electrical conduction system, including ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, accessory pathways, and ischemia-related arrhythmias, showing that the three-lead ECGs align with the clinical data. This minimal model serves as a computationally efficient digital twin of the heart.",
