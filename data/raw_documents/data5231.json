    "abstract": "Aims:\n        \n      \n      Videourodynamics is the addition of imaging to invasive urodynamics and one of the methods to ensure objective diagnosis in persons with signs or symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction. This manuscript has the aim to outline the basics of the practice of videourodynamics and to elementary explain interpretation of the results.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Literature sources and expert opinion were arranged to provide the reader with an introductory overview of current knowledge.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Videourodynamics was-like most diagnostics in health care-introduced on the basis of plausibility and expert conviction but has stood the test of time. Videourodynamics has, especially in patients with congenital or acquired neurogenic dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, undisputedly although not precisely quantifiable, added to (lower urinary tract) health care quality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The manuscript summarizes the basic elements of indication, practice, and interpretation of videourodynamics.",
