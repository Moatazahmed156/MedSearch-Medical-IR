    "abstract": "Although nonpsittacine avian species comprise many different groups of birds, basic medical and surgical principles common to wound management in many vertebrate species are still applicable. This article will delve into examination and wound assessment along with therapeutic stabilization of wounded nonpsittacine birds. An overview of common case presentations that lead to a necessity for wound care are included, and may focus on one particular avian group, but the information can be used on a variety of avian species.",
