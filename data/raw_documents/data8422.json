    "abstract": "Over recent decades, noninvasive imaging has become well established in the diagnostic work-up of patients suffering from myocardial infarction. It provides insights into the individual patient's prognosis and guides therapeutic decisions. MRI has long been considered the standard of reference in the noninvasive imaging of myocardial infarction. Only recently have different multidetector-row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) techniques successfully been evaluated for the visualization of myocardial infarction. This article describes different concepts of cardiac MDCT imaging in acute and chronic myocardial infarction. MDCT assessment of myocardial edema, myocardial perfusion and delayed myocardial contrast enhancement are introduced, with the latter evolving as key concept of viability imaging by means of MDCT. The current status of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of myocardial infarction is reviewed.",
