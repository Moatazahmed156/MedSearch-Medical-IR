  "title": "Evolving Concepts and Contemporary Management of Early-Stage Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Approach to Grey Zones from a Comprehensive Breast Unit Part 2: Systemic Treatment.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer represents the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among women globally, with significant progress in systemic therapy, surgical techniques, and radiotherapy contributing to improved clinical outcomes. However, many clinical scenarios encountered in daily practice are not fully addressed by randomized trials, leaving persistent grey zones in the management of early-stage breast cancer. To meet these challenges, the multidisciplinary panel at Research Institute of Senology, Acıbadem University outlined experience-based recommendations for clinical situations typically faced in daily practice. Herein we aim to reflect both current evidence and institutional practice and provide practical guidance in areas where uncertainty persists. As breast cancer treatment continues to evolve, updates will be required to integrate emerging data and refine individualized patient care.",
