    "abstract": "Wound healing research has produced some startling discoveries during the past decade. Foremost among these is the observation that cutaneous wounds created and healed in utero are histologically indistinguishable from intact, unwounded tissue. Observers have documented that the acute inflammatory response and endogenous immunoglobulins that characterize healing in human beings after birth are absent in the fetal wound. Determination of the cellular and biochemical differences between fetal and postdelivery wound healing offers the promise of improved control over the process of tissue repair. Another promise of fetal wound healing research is the option of in utero repair of defects such as cleft lip and palate. We review what is known at present about fetal wound healing.",
