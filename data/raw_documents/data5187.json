    "abstract": "Liver diseases frequently coexist with heart disease. The causes of coexistent heart and liver disease are categorized into four groups: (1) heart disease affecting the liver, (2) liver disease affecting the heart, (3) cardiac and hepatic manifestations of a common cause, and (4) coexistent heart and liver disease with distinct causes. Discerning the cause of cardiac and liver dysfunction is important in the management of these conditions, particularly when considering surgical intervention or heart or liver transplantation.",
