    "abstract": "For over 50 years, clinicians have used hypothermia to manage traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the last two decades numerous trials have assessed whether hypothermia is of benefit in patients. Mild to moderate hypothermia reduces the intracranial pressure (ICP). Randomized control trials for short-term hypothermia indicate no benefit in outcome after severe TBI, whereas longer-term hypothermia could be of benefit by reducing ICP. This article summarises current evidence and gives recommendations based upon the conclusions.",
