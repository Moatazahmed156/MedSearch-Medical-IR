  "title": "Effects of Adapted Physical Activity Programs on Body Composition and Sports Performance in a Patient with Parkinson's Disease: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "The benefits of physical activity on physical and mental health are well established. Exercise can be particularly advantageous in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where progressive loss of muscle mass and impaired motor performance are common. We report the case of a 58-year-old man with PD who underwent a structured, adapted physical activity program in preparation for a relay swim across the Strait of Messina (Sicily, Italy). The aim was to evaluate changes in body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass) and performance following four months of adapted swimming training, alongside adapted physical activity in the gym and Nordic walking. The patient swam 1300 m in 42 min and 38 s in the relay, which was a marked improvement from the baseline and subsequent assessments. In conclusion, while a longer follow-up period and a larger patient sample would be necessary, the findings from this case study suggest that the adapted exercise program improved both physical fitness and body composition. This generally supports the key role of physical activity in managing Parkinson's disease and, in particular, the positive effects of adaptive sports training.",
