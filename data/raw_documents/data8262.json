    "abstract": "A new instrument has been developed enabling clinicians to map and study the healing process of a wound. Early assessment of the instrument demonstrated promising results both during bench testing as well as during initial in vivo measurements on a skin abrasion. Clear differences between healthy and wounded tissue were demonstrated and a pattern was observed, potentially indicative of the healing process for this particular wound.",
