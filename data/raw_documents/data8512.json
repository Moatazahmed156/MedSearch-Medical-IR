    "abstract": "Antiglaucomatous ocular side effects can be divided into specific and non specific ones. Non specific ocular side effects are mainly caused by preservative agents; they are essentially external ocular irritations. Specific ocular side effects are strongly related to the mechanism of action of the drug. These specific ocular side effects are described, caution being taken to precise the strength of the association between each side effect and the related drug by using the classification of World Health Organisation (WHO) (certain, probable, possible or unlikely).",
