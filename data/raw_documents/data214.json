    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the correlation between the Bruxism Episodes Index (BEI) that determines the number of bruxism episodes per hour of sleep and sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Methods: Seventy-seven participants (56 women and 21 men) in which probable sleep bruxism was diagnosed using guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine underwent video-polysomnography. Sleep quality was measured using PSQI.Results: The analysis showed the lack of a statistically significant correlation between the BEI and PSQI scores (p = 0.55). Analysis also showed that the study group (bruxers) and control group (non-bruxers) did not differ significantly in terms of PSQI scores (p = 0.88).Conclusion: The intensity of bruxism seems not to affect the quality of sleep. However, the topic of the relationship between sleep quality and the occurrence of sleep bruxism requires further research, taking into account co-occurring sleep disorders and sleep architecture.",
