    "abstract": "Eu2+-doped calcium zirconates, Ca1-x Eu x ZrO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), were synthesized as novel environmentally friendly inorganic yellow pigments by the conventional solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, and color were characterized. The Eu2+-doped samples strongly absorbed blue light in the wavelength range of 435-480 nm, which was caused by the 4f-5d allowed transition of Eu2+. The color of the sample gradually became brilliant yellow with increasing the Eu2+ content. Among the samples synthesized in this study, the brightest yellow color was obtained with the Ca0.7Eu0.3ZrO3 (a* = +11.5 and b* = +70.7) sample. Compared with the commercially available praseodymium yellow pigment (a* = -3.28, b* = +70.3), the yellowness value (b*) of Ca0.7Eu0.3ZrO3 was comparable and the redness value (a*) was higher. As a result, this pigment exhibited a reddish yellow color as compared with praseodymium yellow. In addition, this pigment was chemically stable. Therefore, the Ca0.7Eu0.3ZrO3 pigment has the potential to become a novel environmentally friendly inorganic yellow pigment.",
