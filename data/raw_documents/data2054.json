    "abstract": "Lung cancer, which has the highest morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, involves intricate interactions with the nervous system. Research indicates that the nervous system not only plays a role in the origin of lung cancer, but also engages in complex interactions with cancer cells through neurons, neurotransmitters, and various neuroactive molecules during tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, especially in brain metastases. Cancer and its therapies can remodel the nervous system. Despite advancements in immunotherapy and targeted therapies in recent years, drug resistance of lung cancer cells after treatment limits improvements in patient survival and prognosis. The emergence of neuroscience has created new opportunities for the treatment of lung cancer. However, it also presents challenges. This review emphasizes that a deeper understanding of the interactions between the nervous system and lung cancer, along with the identification of new therapeutic targets, may lead to significant advancements or even a revolution in treatment strategies for patients with lung cancer.",
