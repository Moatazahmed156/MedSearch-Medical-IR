    "abstract": "The present article is devoted to problems pertaining to the combined (simultaneous) medical application of the therapeutic physical factors. The classification of the methods used in combined physical therapy is proposed, their advantages over the traditional therapeutic modalities are discussed, the general principles of simultaneous application of the medical physical factors are considered. The possible variants of interaction between such physical factors in the case of their combined application are theoretically determined, the criteria for their quantitative assessment (coefficients of synergism and effectiveness of combination) are offered, examples of their application for the evaluation of the efficiency of the selected combinations are provided.",
