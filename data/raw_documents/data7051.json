    "abstract": "The outcome of the 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference (OCCC) held in November 2015 in Tokyo, Japan, was the development of new and revised consensus statements to guide clinical investigations in ovarian cancer. The OCCC statements may also have direct application to daily clinical practice. This review examines the consensus statements for recurrent ovarian cancer and their impact on treatment paradigms. Importantly, patients are no longer to be categorized by the platinum-free interval (with its arbitrary 6-month cut-off points) but according to the question: 'is platinum still an option for the patient?' Another important change since the 4th OCCC in 2010 is the inclusion of BRCA mutation status when defining patient subgroups for entry into clinical trials.",
