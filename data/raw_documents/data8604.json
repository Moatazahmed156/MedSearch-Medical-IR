    "abstract": "Wound healing, especially chronic wounds, has been one of the major challenges in the field of biomedicine. Drug therapy alone is not effective, so a variety of functional wound healing dressings have been developed. Microneedles have attracted more and more attentions in the field of wound healing dressings due to their penetration and high drug delivery efficiency. In this review, all the studies on the application of microneedles in wound healing in recent years are summarized, classify different microneedles according to their functions in the process of wound healing, discuss the current challenges in the transformation of microneedle technology toward clinical applications, and finally look forward to the future design and development directions of microneedles in this field.",
