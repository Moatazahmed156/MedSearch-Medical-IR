    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Head and neck paragangliomas (HNPs) have been associated with gene mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, but the clinical significance remains unclear. We sought to explore the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment methods, and outcomes of SDH-mutated HNPs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Databases were systematically searched. Pooled event ratio and relative 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Meta-regression was performed. Cochran's Q test and I2 test assessed heterogeneity. Funnel plot and Egger's regression test assessed publication bias.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-two studies with 8849 patients were included. Meta-regression revealed a significant correlation between multifocality and SDHD mutations (0.03 ± 0.006, p < 0.0001) and between distant metastases and SDHB mutations (0.06 ± 0.023, p = 0.008). There was no correlation between sex, age, tumor size, or familial occurrences and SDH-related mutations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Multifocality of HNPs correlates with the SDHD mutational subtype, and metastases correlate with the SDHB subtype. Knowledge of HNP phenotypes associated with SDH-related mutations has the potential to influence the management approach to such HNPs.",
