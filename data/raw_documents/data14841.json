  "title": "Correlation between serum bile acids with severity of liver cirrhosis: A case-control study.",
  "abstract": "The association of serum bile acid levels with liver cirrhosis severity is of interest. Hence, 100 patients were admitted, among them 50 patients had variable severity of liver cirrhosis and 50 patients were controls. Serum bile acid levels were measured and their association was also analyzed with clinical parameters like Child-Pugh score, MELD score and liver function tests. The results indicate that serum bile acid concentrations are strongly associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis and potentially as a disease progression biomarker. Thus, the clinical value of bile acids as a marker for the severity of liver cirrhosis is shown.",
