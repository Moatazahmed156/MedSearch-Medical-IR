  "title": "Identification of Co-Diagnostic Genes and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Asthma and Sepsis Through Mendelian Randomization and Immune Infiltration Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between asthma and sepsis, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study explores the co-diagnostic genes and molecular links between asthma and sepsis using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and bioinformatics methods, and further validates the findings through clinical data, aiming to identify potential therapeutic targets and drugs. Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) data from an Icelandic population were used for two-sample MR analysis. Differential expression analysis identified common genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses explored biological functions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves validated gene performance, and immune cell infiltration was analyzed using CIBERSORT. Drug targets were predicted using DrugSigDB and validated by molecular docking. Clinical data of the three groups of people were collected, and baseline analysis, ROC curve analysis, and comparison of the expression levels of  At the genetic level, 435 genes related to asthma and 1,385 genes related to sepsis were identified, with 141 common genes. Further findings showed that there were 247 differentially expressed genes in asthma and 2,878 differentially expressed genes in sepsis, and 65 common differentially expressed genes were enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. The key gene ",
