  "title": "Telemedicine in chronic lung disease management: progress and prospects.",
  "abstract": "Chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges by enabling remote patient monitoring, virtual consultations, and digital health interventions. Advances in home spirometry, wearable devices, and mobile health applications have improved early detection of disease exacerbations, medication adherence, and patient self-management of chronic lung diseases. Telerehabilitation programs have demonstrated their efficacy in enhancing exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic lung diseases. Despite these advancements, challenges such as disparities in digital access, patient engagement, costs, and regulatory frameworks limit widespread adoption. As telemedicine has become an integral component of respiratory care, further research is required to optimize its implementation, evaluate long-term clinical outcomes, and ensure equitable access to all patients. This review explores the current state of telemedicine in chronic lung disease management, highlights technological innovations, and discusses future directions for enhancing its role in improving patient outcomes.",
