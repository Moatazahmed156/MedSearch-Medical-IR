    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers comprise 4% of the cancer burden in the United States each year. Many types of head and neck cancers present as an asymptomatic, nontender neck mass or nonspecific symptoms, such as hoarseness, sore throat, and pain. Head and neck cancers are frequently diagnosed incidentally by the primary care physician or dentist. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of several common head and neck cancers in order to provide an increased awareness for the internist to facilitate early detection of these diseases.",
