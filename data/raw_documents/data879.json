    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To observe the effect of metformin on the tight junction of intestinal epithelial cells and its relevant mechanism.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Caco-2 cell monolayers were incubated with or without tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/mL) in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of metformin. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured at various time points. Caco-2 cell permeability was assessed using fluorescein permeability test. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the distribution of tight junction protein. Western blotting and Real-Time PCR were used to detect the expression of tight junction protein and Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)-Myosin light chain (MLC) signaling pathway.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Metformin attenuates the effects of TNF-α on Caco-2 cell TEER and paracellular permeability, prevents TNF-α-induced morphological disruption of tight junctions, ameliorates the inhibiting effect of TNF-α on epithelial tight junction-related protein expression and suppresses the TNF-α-induced increase in MLCK production.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Metformin can stabilize and up-regulate tight junction protein by inhibiting MLCK-MLC signaling pathway, thus ameliorating the tight junction of intestinal epithelial cells.",
