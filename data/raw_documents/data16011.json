  "title": "Psychosocial Determinants of Preparedness and Stress Management among Frontline Healthcare Workers in Kerala during Pandemic Response: A Cross-sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) experienced unprecedented psychosocial stress during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Their preparedness, shaped by knowledge, training, and occupational role, played a critical role in response effectiveness. This study aimed to assess knowledge, preparedness, and stress among HCWs in Kerala, India. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 369 HCWs, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals, from various healthcare levels across Kerala. Data were collected using a structured, validated questionnaire assessing demographics, self-perceived knowledge, training experiences, attitudes, and psychosocial impacts. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, with the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to explore associations between variables. Nurses constituted the majority of respondents (71.5%), and 65.3% were aged 20-39 years. While prepandemic training was perceived as inadequate by most participants, 94.6% reported improved preparedness following training during the pandemic. Significant associations were found between occupation and perceived knowledge (P < 0.05). Attitude-related responses revealed that 53.9% felt scared at the onset, while 95.1% later reported mental preparedness for future waves. Occupational role was significantly associated with perceived luck in surviving the pandemic (P = 0.048) and multiple experience-related variables, including early mental health impact (P = 0.04). The findings highlight discrepancies in training adequacy and suggest that younger and nursing professionals were more psychologically impacted. Targeted interventions are needed to address profession-specific stressors and resilience building. Effective in-pandemic training improved preparedness and confidence. Strengthening predisaster training and mental health support is essential for building a resilient healthcare workforce.",
