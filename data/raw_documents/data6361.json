    "abstract": "The prostates of eight patients scheduled to undergo prostatectomies were studied prospectively by transabdominal gray scale ultrasound and computed tomography. Computed tomography gave excellent visualization of prostate morphology and pelvic anatomic relationships. Ultrasound provided more histopathologic information in the cases of carcinoma and prostatitis. Additionally, its capacity to distinguish surgical capsule from adenoma, in benign prostatic hypertrophy, made it more useful for volume determinations.",
