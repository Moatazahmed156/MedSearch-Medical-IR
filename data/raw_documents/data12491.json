  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of mortality among cancer patients in developed countries. Each new study in this field can contribute to better detection, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. Our study aimed to assess transcriptional activity of genes associated with the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endobiotics in all three phases in the CRC ",
