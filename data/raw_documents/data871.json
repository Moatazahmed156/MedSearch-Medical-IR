    "abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and hyperpermeability that occurs following traumatic and ischemic insults lead to various downstream ill effects such as cerebral edema and elevation of intracranial pressure. The inter-endothelial tight junctions that consist of tight junction proteins are critical regulators of BBB dysfunctions and hyperpermeability. The major tight junction-associated proteins of the BBB are occludin, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules that are intracellularly linked to the adaptor protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Quantitative measurement of tight junction-associated proteins provides valuable insight into barrier integrity and mechanisms that regulate microvascular hyperpermeability. Western blot analysis is a commonly used method to separate and identify proteins in a mixture using gel electrophoresis. Understanding the changes in the expression of one or more of these proteins is critical to evaluating barrier integrity and permeability in health and disease. Furthermore, studying them will provide insight into the associated downstream signaling pathways and evaluation of therapeutic approaches for regulating BBB permeability. Herein, we have described the protocol for immunoblot analysis of ZO-1 as an indicator of tight junction integrity in brain microvascular endothelial cells.",
