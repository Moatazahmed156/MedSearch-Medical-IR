  "title": "Analytical cohort study on intraoperative hypotension as a risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury.",
  "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication that happens after surgery and intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a modifiable risk factor. We did a cohort analytical study consisting of 145 adult patients who were undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia. Patients who were diagnosed with IOH (defined as mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg for ≥15 minutes), had significantly higher rates of postoperative AKI. Multivariate analysis confirmed independent predictors of AKI including IOH, chronic kidney disease, and prolonged operative time. Overall, this study highlights the importance of hemodynamic monitoring and the continuing maintenance of MAP ≥65 mmHg as a potential way to reduce renal complications.",
  "disease": "chronic kidney disease"
