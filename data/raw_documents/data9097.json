    "abstract": "The autoxidation of fatty esters of linseed oil is studied extensively, and the products formed from these reactions are identified. The mechanism suggested for autoxidation, helps to understand fat deterioration resulting in offensive odours and flavours, and to develop new antioxidants to prevent this decomposition. The oxidation following oxidative copolymerization should be investigated in order to understand and to develop new methodology to prevent yellowing. Although the yellowing of indoor oil paints could be prevented to an extent, no compound is known to completely inhibit this process nor has the cause for this yellow colouration been isolated, leaving the doors wide open for further investigation.",
