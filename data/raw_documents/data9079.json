    "abstract": "Prioritizing attention to reward-predictive items is critical for survival, but challenging because these items rarely appear in the same feature or within the same environment. However, whether attention selection can be adaptively tuned to items that matched the context-dependent, relative feature of previously rewarded items remains largely unknown. In four experiments (N = 40 per experiment), we trained participants to learn the color-reward association and then adopted visual search tasks in which the color of a singleton distractor matched either the feature value (e.g., red or yellow) or feature relationship (i.e., redder or yellower) of previously rewarded colors. We consistently found enhanced attentional capture by a singleton distractor when it was relationally matched to the high reward compared with the low reward relationship, in addition to observing the typical effect of learned value on singletons matching the previously rewarded colors. Our findings provide novel evidence for the flexibility of value-driven attention via feature relationship, which is particularly useful given the changeable sensory inputs in real-world searches.
