  "abstract": "Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a protein mainly located in mitochondria, exhibits antiapoptotic activity, promoting tumor growth. Herein, we designed an innovative strategy for targeting mitochondria to inhibit Mcl-1 expression effectively. To this end, we synthesized a novel berberine-based ligand, BerT. We also synthesized and comprehensively characterized its corresponding Zn(II) complexes, including [Zn(BerT)(H",
