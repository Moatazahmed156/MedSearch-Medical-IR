  "title": "Gasdermin B-mediated pyroptosis as a host defense against swine enteric coronaviruses and its antagonism by PEDV.",
  "abstract": "Gasdermin B (GSDMB), a member of the spore-forming protein gasdermin (GSDM) family, is critical for inflammation and immunity and has been genetically linked to human diseases. Despite its prominent expression at mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, GSDMB's role in defending against viral pathogens at these barrier tissues remains poorly defined. Here, we reveal that porcine GSDMB (pGSDMB), which is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium, is a potent innate restriction factor against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a major enteric coronavirus. Mechanistically, PEDV infection activated caspase-3/6/7 to cleave pGSDMB at D237, generating an active N-terminal fragment (pGSDMB",
