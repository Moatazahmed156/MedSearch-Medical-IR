  "title": "Thyroid Storm-Induced Respiratory Failure Requiring Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.",
  "abstract": "Thyroid storm is a life-threatening endocrine emergency that can result in multiorgan failure, including severe respiratory compromise. Although venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in some cases, the role of venovenous ECMO is even more rare. The authors reported a case of a 41-year-old female with a history of uncontrolled hypertension who presented with thyroid storm complicated by respiratory failure requiring venovenous ECMO. This case highlighted the critical management strategies, the role of extracorporeal support, and outcomes in severe thyroid storm.",
