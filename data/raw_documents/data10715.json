  "title": "Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Gut-Nasal Axis Alterations in Preschool Children with Allergic Rhinitis and Functional Constipation.",
  "abstract": "The comorbidity of allergic rhinitis (AR) and functional constipation (FC) in preschool children represents an emerging clinical entity; yet its underlying microbial mechanisms remain inadequately elucidated. This study sought to comprehensively characterize the gut microbiota (GM) profile and functional alterations in children with concurrent AR and FC (ARFC), with specific emphasis on the gut-nasal axis. In this cross-sectional analysis, fecal samples from 32 ARFC, 22 AR, and 21 healthy control (HC) children underwent  The ARFC group exhibited significant GM dysbiosis, including elevated α-diversity (Shannon index: 5.2 ± 0.3 vs HC 4.5 ± 0.4;  ARFC comorbidity is characterized by a distinct GM signature featuring pathogenic expansion, metabolic dysfunction, and compensatory ",
