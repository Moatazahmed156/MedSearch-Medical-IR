  "title": "Quality of Life Changes Among Breast Cancer Survivors Following Mastectomy.",
  "abstract": "Background Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the United States, and can lead to negative impacts on patient self-esteem. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the struggles of breast cancer survivors post-mastectomy in all aspects of their daily lives to encourage the provision of effective support. Methods Data was collected through a 20-question, nationwide, anonymous web-based survey. Questions assessed challenges in life after mastectomy and individual respondents' perceptions. Results A total of 100 responses were collected from breast cancer survivors who underwent mastectomy. Results indicate positive changes in patient health following recovery, with many survivors noting the development of new healthy habits. However, most participants also reported feeling less physically capable after treatment, resulting in a decreased ability to pursue hobbies and perform daily tasks. These physical limitations are linked to difficulty in survivors' abilities to advance in their careers, which may also be connected to increased financial burden during and after treatment. Conclusion In this nationwide survey of breast cancer survivors who underwent mastectomy, many survey participants indicated feelings of isolation, which, along with lowered self-esteem post-surgery, contributes to decreased mental health. Reconstructive surgery also plays a large role in survivors' quality of life, with participants who underwent breast reconstruction indicating greater satisfaction with their current lifestyles.",
