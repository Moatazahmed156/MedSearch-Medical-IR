    "abstract": "Yellow tea, a unique type of tea in China which is characterized with yellow color, has gained increasing popularity due to its pleasant taste. However, transformation of aroma compounds during sealed yellowing has been poorly understood. Results of sensory evaluation exhibited that yellowing time was the key factor for flavor and fragrance formation. A total of 52 volatile components during sealed yellowing process of Pingyang yellow soup were further collected and analyzed. The results demonstrated that the sealed yellowing process significantly increased the ratio of alcohol and aldehyde compounds in the aroma volatiles of yellow tea, which were primarily composed of geraniol, linalool, phenylacetaldehyde, linalool oxide and cis-3-hexenol, and their proportion increased with the prolongation of sealed yellowing. Mechanistic speculation revealed that the sealed yellowing process promoted release of alcoholic aroma compounds from their glycoside precursors and enhanced Strecker and oxidative degradation. This study revealed the transformation mechanism of aroma profile during the sealed yellowing process, which would facilitate processing of yellow tea.",
