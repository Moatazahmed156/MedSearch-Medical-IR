  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide problem due to the lack of effective therapy and accurate methods for timely diagnosis. The complexity of AD's pathophysiology complicates the development of effective therapeutic agents, as most drugs act on only one therapeutic target, bypassing others. The design and development of multifunctional agents capable of altering metal ion-induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, and toxic beta amyloid (Aβ) aggregates is of interest. Herein, we report the first boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) based bifunctional copper chelator with clioquinol, BDP-CLQ, capable of both optical detection of Aβ fibrils and copper chelation, with multiple anti-AD properties. Foremost, BDP-CLQ demonstrated a 3-fold and 5-fold fluorescence increase at 650 nm and 565 nm in the presence of Aβ and effective copper chelation (pK",
