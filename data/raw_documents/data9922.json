  "title": "Adrenal Cushing's Syndrome in Pregnancy Complicated by Fetal Growth Restriction Following Retroperitoneoscopic Adrenalectomy.",
  "abstract": "A 29-year-old Japanese pregnant woman, G5P3A1, conceived spontaneously and was referred to our hospital because of uncontrolled hypertension at 24 weeks of gestation. On admission, she presented with physical findings characteristic of Cushing's syndrome (CS), such as moon face, buffalo hump, and reddish-purple striae. Laboratory examination revealed hyperglycemia and hypercortisolism with suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Imaging studies revealed a right adrenocortical adenoma, and the patient was clinically diagnosed with adrenal CS. At 28 weeks, she underwent retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy, which normalized maternal cortisol levels and improved metabolic abnormalities. Despite these improvements, she was diagnosed with fetal growth restriction accompanied by superimposed preeclampsia at approximately 33 weeks. The maternal serum soluble fms-like kinase 1 (sFlt-1)/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio was markedly elevated. At 36 weeks, an emergency cesarean section was performed for fetal compromise, resulting in the delivery of a small-for-gestational-age infant. Histopathological examination of the placenta revealed ischemic changes consistent with placental insufficiency. Both the mother and infant were discharged in stable conditions. The present case shows that although adrenalectomy during pregnancy can correct endocrine abnormalities, it does not necessarily prevent subsequent fetal growth restriction.",
