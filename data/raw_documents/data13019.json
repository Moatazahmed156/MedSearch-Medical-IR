  "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely recognized as a key driver of aging and neurodegenerative diseases, with mitophagy acting as an essential cellular mechanism for the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria. While pharmacological activation of mitophagy has been reported to exert beneficial effects across multiple neurodegenerative diseases, its functional relevance in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains poorly characterized.
