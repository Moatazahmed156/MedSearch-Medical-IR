  "title": "Effects of subcutaneous or oral semaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide, reduce cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the consistency between oral and subcutaneous formulations remains unclear. This meta-analysis was registered prospectively in PROSPERO (CRD 420251147337). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-/random-effects models, with sensitivity, subgroup, and GRADE assessments. Four RCTs ( Semaglutide lowers cardiovascular risk in T2DM, primarily improving major adverse cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization, with oral and subcutaneous forms demonstrating consistent efficacy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251147337, PROSPERO CRD420251147337.",
