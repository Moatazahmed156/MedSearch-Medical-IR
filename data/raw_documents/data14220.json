  "title": "Standardized Ginkgo Biloba Extract (EGb 761) for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a prevalent degenerative joint disorder characterized by progressive cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and joint dysfunction, remains a major cause of disability worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761), a standardized multi-component natural product containing flavonoid glycosides and terpene lactones, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and Chondroprotection. This narrative review synthesizes current experimental and clinical findings on the potential therapeutic role of EGb 761 in KOA. To provide a comprehensive overview, relevant literature published up to 2025 was identified through searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as by screening reference lists of key studies. Considering the complex pathogenesis of KOA and the multi-target pharmacological actions of EGb 761, this review aims to consolidate existing findings and clarify its potential role as an adjunctive therapy. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that EGb 761 may reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and chondrocyte apoptosis, leading to modest improvements in pain relief and joint function, while demonstrating a favorable safety profile. However, current evidence is limited by small sample sizes, methodological heterogeneity, short study durations, and risk of bias. While the available evidence is promising, it remains inconclusive that EGb 761 offers significant therapeutic benefits for individuals with KOA. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are warranted.",
