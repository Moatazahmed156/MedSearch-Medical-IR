  "abstract": "Breast carcinoma is a prevalent and life-threatening disease in women, requiring early detection for effective treatment. Its development is influenced by genetic, hormonal, and lifestyle factors. The MDA-MB-231 cell line is widely used to investigate breast cancer biology and therapy. 4-Hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole has demonstrated promising cellular effects, including antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic activities. The present research assessed the apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and antioxidant effects of 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole in MDA-MB-231 cells. The study was categorized into an untreated group and three experimental groups treated with different doses of 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole. Cell viability was evaluated using MTT, crystal violet, and trypan blue assays. Angiogenesis and apoptosis were measured by ELISA of VEGF and p53, while antioxidants were assessed by GSH and SOD levels. A 50 µg/ml dose of 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole showed significant effects compared to the control groups. MTT, crystal violet, and trypan blue assays revealed that 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole reduced the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells and promoted cell death. ELISA results further demonstrated a decrease in angiogenic potential, elevated p53 levels, and a reduction in SOD and GSH antioxidant levels. Additionally, scratch assay and DAPI/PI staining confirmed apoptosis. These findings suggest that 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzothiazole exerts significant apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.",
