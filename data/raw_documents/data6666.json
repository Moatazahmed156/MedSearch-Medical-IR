    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To determine the indications for lymph node dissection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      The study included 105 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent dissection of 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16a2 groups of lymph nodes. Concomitant liver diseases were not a contraindication for lymph node dissection. Immediate and long-term treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Lymph node dissection did not affect the number of postoperative complications (p=0.83) and mortality (p=0.34). The number of tumors (p=0.02) and concomitant liver diseases (p=0.05) significantly affected lymph node metastatic lesions. Metastases were found only in lymph nodes >1 cm. Metastatic lesions of lymph nodes in hepatoduodenal ligament and retropancreatic zone were the most common. However, 5 patients had metastatic lesions of aortocaval and celiac lymph nodes without metastases in hepatoduodenal ligament. Overall 5-year survival of patients with lymph node metastases after total resection was 32.4%. It is a better result compared to other treatments.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There was no significant effect of lymph node dissection on immediate postoperative results regardless concomitant pathology. Lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with a high risk of metastasis or lymph nodes metastases.",
