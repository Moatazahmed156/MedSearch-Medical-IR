    "abstract": "The kidney's intricate physiology relies on finely tuned gene regulatory networks that coordinate cellular responses to metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic stress. Beyond protein-coding transcripts, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have emerged as pivotal regulators of renal biology. By modulating transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic pathways, ncRNAs govern podocyte integrity, tubular adaptation, intercellular signaling, and immune activation. Dysregulation of these networks is now recognized as a hallmark of major kidney diseases, ranging from diabetic nephropathy and acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease, glomerulopathies, and polycystic kidney disease. Mechanistic studies have revealed how pathogenic ncRNAs drive apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and cystic remodeling, while protective ncRNAs mitigate these processes, highlighting their dual roles as both disease mediators and therapeutic targets. The exceptional stability of ncRNAs in urine, plasma, and exosomes further positions them as minimally invasive biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value. Translational advances include anti-miR and mimic-based therapies (e.g., lademirsen targeting miR-21, miR-29 mimics, anti-miR-17 oligonucleotides), alongside lncRNA silencing strategies, although challenges in delivery, safety, and redundancy remain significant. This review integrates molecular mechanisms with translational perspectives, providing a comprehensive synthesis of how ncRNAs shape renal pathophysiology. By bridging mechanistic insights with emerging diagnostic and therapeutic applications, we highlight the potential of ncRNAs to transform nephrology, paving the way for biomarker-driven precision medicine and novel interventions aimed at intercepting kidney injury at its regulatory roots. In clinical terms, ncRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics promise earlier detection, more precise risk stratification, and individualized treatment selection within precision nephrology.",
