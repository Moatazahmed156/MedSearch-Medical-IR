    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury in acute decompensated heart failure leads to increased readmissions regardless of being transient or sustained at the time of discharge. Timely identification of acute kidney injury and worsening heart failure in patients with acute decompensated heart failure is of utmost importance to optimize different components of heart failure treatment. Acute kidney injury is a strong predictor of poor outcomes and early death in patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and acute right-sided heart failure. Extracorporeal ultrafiltration should not be used as an initial or alternative to diuretic therapy. It should be reserved for diuretic-resistant individuals.",
