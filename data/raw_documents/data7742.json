    "abstract": "The transition from paediatric care to adult care is often difficult, especially in children with chronic diseases like asthma. A significant number of children reach remission throughout puberty; consequently, they are not tracked down for subsequent follow-ups and are not included in transition programmes to adult care. This case report focuses on a young adult with asthma that began in childhood and went into remission during adolescence, only to experience a recurrence when the patient was a young adult. Due to failing to complete the transition process into adult care services, she had poor adherence to therapy and asthma control.Adherence and asthma control significantly improved after a multidisciplinary approach in an adult care setting. In conclusion, appropriate transition and a multidisciplinary approach are critical for the effective management of asthma in young adults.",
