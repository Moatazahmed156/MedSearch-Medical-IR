    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common autoimmune disorders. In addition to chronic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis may present a variety of extra-articular manifestations, most commonly of the skin.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Cutaneous manifestations associated with rheumatoid arthritis can be diverse, both specific and nonspecific. Which dermatoses should lead you to the diagnosis of an underlying rheumatoid arthritis?\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Evaluation of exemplary overviews, case presentations and relevant textbook articles.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Rheumatoid arthritis presents various specific and nonspecific skin manifestations. Besides visual diagnosis like classic rheumatoid nodules a histopathologic correlation or an interdisciplinary approach is often needed, such as for diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The early detection and correct classification of cutaneous manifestations associated with rheumatoid arthritis can be groundbreaking for a successful therapy and a consequently better prognosis for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore dermatologists bear responsibility in the patient-centered care.",
