  "title": "Association between Visfatin gene rs9034 and rs2505568 polymorphisms with the risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese population: A case-control study.",
  "abstract": "Multiple factors including chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are believed to increase the risk of HCC. Furthermore, recent studies on genetic mutations during HCC development have revealed potential genetic factors that may account for the development of the cancer, however, the roles of Visfatin polymorphisms and its relationship in HCC have not yet been demonstrated. The aim of current study was to investigate whether Visfatin gene polymorphisms could contribute to the susceptibility of HBV-related liver diseases in the Guangxi Chinese population. Two Visfatin single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs9034 and rs2505568, were genotyped using the single-base extension method in 140 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 143 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 151 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 132 healthy subjects. Subjects carrying the rs2505568 AT genotype showed a significantly greater risk of CHB, LC, and HCC than those carrying the TT genotype. Similarly, carriers of the rs2505568 A allele had elevated risk for CHB, LC, and HCC, in comparison to carriers of the T allele. However, no significant differences in Visfatin rs9034 polymorphisms was observed between the healthy subjects and the patients. Our results suggested that Visfatin rs2505568 polymorphisms significantly associate with HBV-related CHB, LC, and HCC risk in the Guangxi Chinese population.",
