    "abstract": "Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) play a role in chemically induced acute lung injury (CALI). However, the mechanisms that induce alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s) to proliferate, exit the cell cycle, and transdifferentiate into alveolar epithelial type 1 cells (AEC1s) are unclear. Here, we investigated the epithelial cell types and states in a phosgene-induced CALI rat model. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from phosgene-induced CALI rat models (Gas) and normal controls (NC) was performed. From the NC and Gas BALF samples, 37,245 and 29,853 high-quality cells were extracted, respectively. All cell types and states were identified and divided into 23 clusters; three cell types were identified: macrophages, epithelial cells, and macrophage proliferating cells. From NC and Gas samples, 1315 and 1756 epithelial cells were extracted, respectively, and divided into 11 clusters. The number of AEC1s decreased considerably following phosgene inhalation. A unique SOX9-positive AEC2 cell type that expanded considerably in the CALI state was identified. This progenitor cell type may develop into alveolar cells, indicating its stem cell differentiation potential. We present a single-cell genome-scale transcription map that can help uncover disease-associated cytologic signatures for understanding biological changes and regeneration of lung tissues during CALI.",
