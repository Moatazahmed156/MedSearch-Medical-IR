  "title": "Improving MRI-Negative Epilepsy Localization: Synergy of Dual-Probe PET/MR (18F-FDG/11C-FMZ).",
  "abstract": "The localization of refractory epilepsy, especially MRI-negative cases, is a critical challenge in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. To address this challenge, this study proposes a standardized protocol for localizing the epileptogenic focus using a dual-probe Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MR) technique. The protocol focuses on radiotracer selection, imaging sequence design, and image interpretation strategies. Radiotracers selection: This imaging combines ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose (",
