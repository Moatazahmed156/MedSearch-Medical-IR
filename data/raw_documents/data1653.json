    "abstract": "Understanding how social dynamics interact with natural hazards is one of the main challenges at global and local scales in the world for studying social vulnerability to natural hazards. In this study, we explore the spatial and temporal changes of social vulnerability of cities in Zhejiang province to natural hazards in China for the last decade. Based on the Zhejiang province's census data and the demographics and socioeconomic data during the period from 2009 to 2018, we have characterized social vulnerability through the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) for 11 cities throughout the province during 2009-2018 and examined spatial changes in social vulnerability using equal interval method. The results indicated that although the comprehensive vulnerability of Zhejiang province shows a declining trend at a county level, the social vulnerability of different city at the provincial level has obvious differences.",
