    "abstract": "T cell migration from blood to, and within lymphoid organs and tissue, as well as, T cell activation rely on complex biochemical signaling events. But T cell migration and activation also take place in distinct mechanical environments and lead to drastic morphological changes and reorganization of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. In this review we discuss how adhesion proteins and the T cell receptor act as mechanosensors to translate these mechanical contexts into signaling events. We further discuss how cell tension could bring a significant contribution to the regulation of T cell signaling and function.",
