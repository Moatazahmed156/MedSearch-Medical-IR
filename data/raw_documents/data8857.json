    "abstract": "Substantial opportunity exists for radiologists to lead practice quality improvement initiatives that extend beyond the boundaries of the radiology department, especially regarding the appropriate, evidence-based utilization of radiological services by clinical colleagues.

An example of one such project is reviewed, with a reflection on lessons learned; specific, practical recommendations derived from past efforts are made.",
