  "abstract": "Accurate risk stratification is essential to optimize neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in the era of precision medicine. This study assessed the feasibility and safety of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-guided neoadjuvant strategy. This interim analysis included patients with mid-low rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3-4N0M0 or cT1-4N1-2M0) from the multicenter, randomized CINTS-R trial using a 2:1 allocation to an experimental or control group. The control group received conventional nCRT (long-course radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine followed by one XELOX cycle). In the experimental group, treatment was stratified as follows: (1) ctDNA-defined high-risk patients received TNT, consisting of the same nCRT followed by five additional XELOX cycles (six in total); (2) ctDNA-defined low-risk patients proceeded directly to surgery after nCRT; and (3) patients with dMMR/MSI-H/TMB-H tumors received neoadjuvant tislelizumab (≥6 cycles). The analysis focuses on feasibility and safety outcomes. Between February 2023 and September 2024, 349 patients were randomized and 316 included in analysis (experimental: 210; control: 106). Among the experimental group, 115 were ctDNA-high-risk and 89 ctDNA-low-risk. High-risk patients were significantly older and more often male, with larger tumors, longer tumor-to-anal verge distance, greater circumferential involvement, and higher EMVI rates (all p ＜0.05). Serious adverse events (SAEs, CTCAE v5.0, grade 3-4) occurred in 10.0 % vs. 6.6 % of patients in the experimental and control groups (p = 0.316). Notably, 15.7 % of TNT-treated patients discontinued chemotherapy due to SAEs, whereas all nCRT recipients completed treatment. This interim analysis demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a ctDNA-guided, risk-adapted neoadjuvant strategy for LARC. Final outcomes will further clarify its clinical efficacy.
