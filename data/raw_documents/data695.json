    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      This article seeks to provide a broad overview of the workplace mental health literature, highlight practical implications of current research, and formulate key recommendations for stakeholders. Various aspects of disability related to mental health disorders, their associated financial costs, and the impact of stigma are covered. This article also discusses key strategies for assessing mental health problems among employees and reviews different types of interventions in the workplace.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Workplace mental health is an evolving area, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. While established national workplace mental health standards do not currently exist, mental illness continues to have a severe impact on the health of organizations, employees, and the economy. Additional research is needed to fully understand and address the diversity of mental health needs among the broad range of employees and organizations across the USA. Employers have a responsibility and an opportunity to create workplaces that support the whole person, not just the employee. While research in the area has increased in the last decade, there is still much to learn in terms of the most effective ways to support our workforce.",
