  "title": "Left Main Coronary Artery Obstruction After Transcatheter Heart Valve Implantation for Aortic Regurgitation.",
  "abstract": "The JenaValve Trilogy transcatheter heart valve (THV) is a percutaneous treatment modality for severe aortic regurgitation. The device is designed to offer stability and lower risk of device migration and coronary occlusion. A 59-year-old woman with severe aortic regurgitation underwent implantation of the JenaValve THV. After discharge, the patient presented with acute coronary syndrome. Evaluation revealed a left main coronary thrombus and intermittent obstruction of the left coronary ostium by the native aortic valve leaflet. This case describes the first reported incidence of coronary artery thrombosis after deployment of the JenaValve Trilogy THV, and the role of multimodal imaging in understanding the diagnosis and complex intervention planning. Aortic valve leaflet obstruction and coronary artery thrombosis are rare complications of JenaValve THV implantation for aortic regurgitation. Multimodal imaging is essential in the diagnosis and management of these complications.",
