  "abstract": "Secondary bacterial infections can significantly worsen the clinical course of influenza virus infections and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality during seasonal influenza epidemics. Despite being a vaccine-preventable disease, influenza-related complications from secondary bacterial infections are an important cause of death, particularly among the elderly population.  In this study, we show that a licensed influenza vaccine not only prevents severe disease upon influenza virus infection but also helps protect against enhanced morbidity due to co- or superinfection with S",
