    "abstract": "Women with a familial ovarian cancer risk are motivated to take steps to reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer. These women are offered surgery to remove their tubes and ovaries to mitigate this risk; however, surgery comes with its own inherent risk which may be unacceptable to some. Other women with familial ovarian cancer do not wish to have surgery due to its impact on fertility. Finally, others are not well enough to have the risk reducing surgery. In addition, surgery cannot reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer completely. Therefore, other ways to reduce an individual’s risk of familial ovarian cancer are a priority to those with an inherited risk and their clinicians. It is known that certain medications can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in all or specific inherited ovarian cancer syndromes. The evidence review will consider those medications, the evidence that supports them, their side effects and the effective doses needed to reduce ovarian cancer in those with a familial ovarian cancer risk.",
