    "abstract": "Integrins are cell surface heterodimers that bind adhesion molecules expressed on other cells or in the extracellular matrix. Integrin-mediated interactions are critical for T cell development in the thymus, migration of T cells in the periphery, and induction of T cell effector functions. In resting T cells, integrins are maintained in a low affinity state. Engagement of the T cell receptor or chemokine receptors increases integrin affinity, enabling integrins to bind their ligands and initiate a signaling cascade resulting in altered cell morphology and motility. Our laboratory is interested how adapter proteins, mediators of intracellular signal transduction, regulate both signals from the T cell receptor to integrins (inside-out signaling) and (outside-in) signals from integrins into the cell.",
