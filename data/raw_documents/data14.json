    "abstract": "Exercise has the potential to positively affect patients with osteosarcoma by improvement of function, mitigation of disability, and maintenance of independence and quality of life. Exercise may also directly impact cancer treatment efficacy. This chapter examines the feasibility and use of exercise or physical activity as therapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma and its survivors. It additionally presents the benefits of physical activity as treatment and rehabilitation both preoperatively (prehabilitation) and postoperatively. This chapter will also discuss barriers to exercise and physical activity for patients with osteosarcoma and its survivors, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and cohesive support system to promote its incorporation into patient treatment plans and ensure compliance.",
