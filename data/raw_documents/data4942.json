    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and endometrial pathologies.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      The database of our institution was reviewed. Cases with endometrial pathology including endometrial cancer (EC), endometrial hyperplasia with atypia and without atypia, normal endometrial findings, between January 2015 to January 2020, were collected. Their CBC results and clinicopathologic data were determined. The relation between the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and endometrial pathologies was evaluated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      NLR was significantly higher in patients with endometrial cancer compared to other endometrial pathologies including endometrial hyperplasia with and without atypia and patients with normal endometrial findings. NLR cut-off value was determined 3.55 to discriminate cancer among other endometrial pathologies. PLR had not a significant difference between the endometrial pathologies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      NLR seems to be an effective and simple marker to discriminate endometrial cancer among endometrial pathologies by contrast with PLR.",
