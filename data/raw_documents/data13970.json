  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic condition characterized by joint degradation and systemic manifestations, which increase the risk of mortality and disability. This study compared the effects of bee venom (BV; subcutaneously administered at 1 mg/kg) and femtosecond laser irradiation (FSL; 830 nm wavelength, 200 mW power, 120 s exposure time, 0.8 cm",
