    "abstract": "Myospherulosis in the jaw is a rare, foreign body reaction that typically follows tooth extraction and the use of petrolatum-based medicaments. It appears as a radiolucency and can be mistaken for endodontic pathosis or other lesions without thorough clinical and radiographic evaluation as well as biopsy submission. Treatment is surgical removal and the recurrence is rare. This case report presents a unique finding of a posterior mandible multilocular radiolucency appearing as an apical lesion on 2-dimensional panoramic imaging until visualized with 3-dimensional imaging. Clinical testing and patient referral led to a biopsy and diagnosis of myospherulosis. This is the first case report of myospherulosis presented in the endodontic literature.",
