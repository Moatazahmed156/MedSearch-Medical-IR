  "title": "PNPLA3 I148M is unrelated to HCC occurrence but associates with poorer tumor differentiation in Korean MASLD: a prospective cohort of 562 patients.",
  "abstract": "The patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) I148M variant has been implicated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is unclear. This study examines the association between the PNPLA3 I148M variant and HCC occurrence. A total of 562 MASLD patients, with and without HCC, were prospectively and consecutively enrolled at two university-affiliated hospital between June 2024 and June 2025. Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal swabs or liver biopsy samples, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed to determine the rs738409 genotype at codon 148 of PNPLA3. The histological grade of HCC was assessed using the Edmondson-Steiner (ES) grading system in patients who underwent core-needle liver biopsy. Among 474 non-HCC patients, the GG genotype was found in 39.9%, GC in 37.1%, and CC in 23.0%. In 88 HCC patients, these frequencies were 45.5%, 36.4%, and 18.2%, respectively. No significant differences in GG genotype distribution were observed between HCC and non-HCC groups (P = 0.509), nor in subgroups by sex, age, obesity status, cirrhosis status, Fibrosis-4 Index, or Liver Stiffness Measurement. However, among HCC patients with histological grading, the GG genotype was significantly associated with higher ES grades (P = 0.0076). The PNPLA3 I148M GG genotype was not significantly associated with increased HCC occurrence in Korean MASLD patients within the present cohort. Although the GG genotype is known to play a role in development and progression of MASLD, further studies are warranted to clarify its contribution to tumor initiation and dedifferentiation.",
