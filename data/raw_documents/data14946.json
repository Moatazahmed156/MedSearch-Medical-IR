  "title": "A sequence-specific, nanoparticle-based biosensor platform for rapid and visual identification of serum hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA in chronic hepatitis B patients.",
  "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Serum HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is a surrogate marker for the transcriptional activity of covalently closed circular DNA. Here, we successfully designed a novel point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platform that allows specific, sensitive, rapid, and visual identification of HBV pgRNA. The platform integrates probe-based reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with either ",
