    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      We aimed to determine the COVID-19 anxiety level in pregnant women who presented to an outpatient clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a descriptive cross-sectional study including 203 of 310 pregnant women who presented to the outpatient clinic of a training and research hospital of the Ministry of Health between 29 September-1 October, 2020. The level of anxiety was assessed with the COVID-19 Anxiety Inventory (CAS) using a face-to-face survey method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean age of the patients was 28.15±5.95 years. In the study, while 6.2% of women over 30 years old was identified to have psychological problems, 0.7% of those under 30 years old had such problems. The rate of diagnosis of COVID-19 in the family/acquaintances of those with an educational level of high school or higher was 56.9%, and those who had an educational level under high school had a corresponding rate of 39.5%. The rate of COVID-19 diagnosis in the family/acquaintances of those with an educational level of high school or higher was significantly higher (p<0.05). The mean COVID-19 anxiety scale score was 0.18±0.47; COVID-19 anxiety was not observed in pregnant women.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study detected no anxiety in pregnant women. Therefore, it can be said that pregnant women do not need immediate psycho-social support.",
