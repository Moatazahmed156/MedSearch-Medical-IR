  "abstract": "The structural integrity of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate, PRP) is a critical determinant of glycoconjugate vaccine quality, yet conventional pharmacopoeial methods lack the resolution to monitor atomic-level alterations during manufacturing. This study employed an orthogonal analytical strategy integrating solution-phase ",
