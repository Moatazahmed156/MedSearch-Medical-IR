    "abstract": "The use of standards in gene expression measurements with DNA microarrays is ubiquitous--they just are not yet the kind of standards that have yielded microarray gene expression profiles that can be readily compared across different studies and different laboratories. They also are not yet enabling microarray measurements of the known, verifiable quality needed so they can be used with confidence in genomic medicine in regulated environments.",
