    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a major global health problem that affects over 124 million individuals worldwide. In the United States, type 2 diabetes affects 90% of the 15.6 persons with diabetes, of which approximately one half remain undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes is increasing exponentially especially among minority populations. In addition, type 2 diabetes, which is normally associated with older adults, is becoming more common in children and adolescents. There are a variety of environmental and genetic factors that seem to mediate the development of type 2 diabetes. This article explores the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and identifies risk factors associated with the development of this disorder.",
