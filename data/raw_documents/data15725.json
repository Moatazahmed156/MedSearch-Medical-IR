  "title": "Pathogen landscape and synergistic interactions in pediatric ARIs: implications for broad-spectrum surveillance via targeted NGS.",
  "abstract": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children present complex interactions between respiratory pathogens and host, contributing to high morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. In this cross-sectional study, 2,044 pediatric in-patient samples were tested for 198 pathogens using targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). Pathogen spectrum and co-infection pattern were analyzed alongside blood-test results and clinical data. Pediatric ARIs presented staggered viral epidemics and age-specific infection patterns from 2022 to 2023. Viral infections were predominant in children under 3 years (67.5%). Specific viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with disease severity, including human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-",
