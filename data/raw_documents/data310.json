    "abstract": "Chronic pain is usually a complex disorder with possible indications for an impairment at the personality functioning level. Guidelines recommend a multiprofessional interdisciplinary treatment approach. Based on the alternative model of personality disorders of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, eleventh revision (ICD-11), an integrative manual was designed to exactly fit the interdisciplinary multimodal treatment of patients of the day clinic for pain at the orthopedic clinic of the University Hospital Heidelberg. The treatment manual specifically promotes various areas of personality functioning levels, such as emotion regulation, identity, empathy and relationships through individual and group interventions against the background of a mentalization-based therapeutic attitude. A focus group was used to qualitatively evaluate the implementation of the new treatment manual. With good applicability of the manual and satisfaction of the therapy team, a common language for the interdisciplinary team could be created to improve the therapeutic interaction.",
