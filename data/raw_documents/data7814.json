    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease and seizures often co-exist. When seizures are provoked in patients with kidney disease, their treatment poses a particular challenge. Seizures may be provoked in the context of uremia, and toxic substances associated with uremic encephalopathy. In that case, the mainstay of therapy is to treat the uremia before consideration for anticonvulsant therapy. Treatment of seizures in the setting of chronic kidney disease requires special attention to selection of anticonvulsant medications and knowledge of the altered pharmacokinetics of these medications, which may require special titration schedule in that setting. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about inter-relation of seizures and kidney disease. The review will also help practitioners who treat patients with renal failure and coexisting seizures in choosing the best treatment options.",
