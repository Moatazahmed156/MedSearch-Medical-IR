  "abstract": "To investigate the associations of the neutrophil/albumin ratio (NAR) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 782 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between NAR and T2DM, adjusting for various confounding factors across different models. Interaction analyses examined the modifying effects of socio-demographic characteristics on the relationship between NAR and T2DM. Mediation analyses were utilized to investigate whether key laboratory indicators and insulin resistance indices mediated the association between NAR and T2DM. Higher NAR levels were positively associated with T2DM risk. (OR[95%CI]:1.649[1.181,2.309],  This study revealed that among women with GDM history, NAR may influence the risk of T2DM through the modulation of RDW and HDL-C. Furthermore, NAR and BMI had a significant interaction affecting T2DM risk, particularly prominent in women with 25 kg/m",
