  "abstract": "Biofilm-resident bacteria exhibit diverse mechanisms to evade eradication, including the highly protective self-produced matrix in which they are embedded. Thus, releasing bacteria from biofilm residence affords antibiotics and immune effectors greater access. We developed a monoclonal antibody directed against an essential biofilm matrix protein that induces rapid collapse of the biofilm matrix with release of bacteria that are in a transient but highly vulnerable phenotype. Bacteria that are newly released (\"NRel\") due to this monoclonal are significantly more sensitive to antibiotic-, antimicrobial peptide- or human PMN-mediated killing ",
