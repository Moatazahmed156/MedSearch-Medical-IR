  "title": "STAT4 gene polymorphism promotes progression of rheumatoid arthritis.",
  "abstract": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Right now, different genes play a crucial role in disease development. The objective was to assess the correlation between STAT4 gene polymorphism (SNPs: rs11889341, rs10181656 and rs7574865) and susceptibility to RA progression in Iraqi population. Three Hundred Twenty-five RA patients and Three Hundred Twenty-five matched controls were enrolled in this study. The genotyping for SNPs was performed using (Tetra-ARMS) technique. The clinical parameters were obtained through laboratory investigations and clinical examination. Our results showed obvious statistical significance between cases and control genotypes regarding to SNPs (rs11889341: CC and TT, rs10181656: GG and rs7574865: TT). Additionally, analysis displayed a discrepancy in genotypes frequency of SNPs (rs11889341: CC among family history and Anti-CCP, but TT genotype with RF), (rs7574865: TT within RF and Anti-CCP, GG genotype in relation to family history. Our study concluded that STAT4 gene polymorphism (SNPs: rs11889341, rs10181656 and rs7574865) were associated with RA development in Iraqi population. Furthermore, the SNPs (rs11889341 and rs7574865) were related to family history, RF and Anti-CCP, while SNP (rs10181656) didn't display any relation among studied population.",
