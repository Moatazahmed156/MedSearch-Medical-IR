  "title": "Does Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Represent a Poly-Herpesvirus Post-Virus Infectious Disease?",
  "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating multisystem illness with unknown etiology. An estimated 17-24 million people representing approximately 1% of the population are afflicted worldwide. In over half of cases, ME/CFS onset is associated with acute \"flu-like\" symptoms, suggesting a role for viruses. However, no single virus has been identified as the only etiological agent. This may reflect the approach employed or more strongly the central dogma associated with herpesviruses replication, which states that a herpesvirus exists in two states, either lytic or latent. The purpose of this review is to address the role that abortive lytic replication may have in the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and other post-acute viral infections and also to raise awareness that these syndromes might be poly-herpesviruses mediated diseases.",
