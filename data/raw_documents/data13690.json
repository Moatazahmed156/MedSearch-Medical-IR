  "title": "Immunomodulatory supramolecular hydrogel for rheumatoid arthritis management via adenosine A2A receptor-mediated macrophage remodeling.",
  "abstract": "Synovial tissue infiltration by pro-inflammatory macrophages is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), correlating strongly with high disease activity scores in affected joints and often lead to progressive joint damage and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is the frontline therapeutic drug for RA, but its efficacy is hampered by short plasma half-life, reduced bioavailability, and severe adverse effects. To address these limitations, we developed an injectable polymer-nanomedicine supramolecular hydrogel (PNSH) with dynamic mechanical properties and morphology tailored for intra-articular administration and sustained drug release with minimized off-target toxicity. The hydrogel was assembled from MTX-loaded polymeric nanoparticles chemically conjugated with partially oxidized glucomannan. ",
