    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a major health problem, accounting for one third of all cancers in women. There is no definitive treatment for breast cancer and its incidence is increasing worldwide every year. Furthermore, breast cancer stem cells cause resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Telomerase is an enzyme that protects telomeres and is activated in 90% of cancer cells, and telomerase activation is a hallmark of cancer. In this review, we examine telomerase activation in breast cancer and breast cancer stem cells and the therapeutic effects of telomerase inhibition in these cells. In this review, we aim to highlight the importance and impact of telomerase inhibition in the treatment of breast cancer and the lack of studies specifically in breast cancer stem cells.",
