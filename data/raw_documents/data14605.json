  "abstract": "Nephrotoxin-mediated kidney injury is an important clinical problem, as it can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Both entities are associated with significant morbidity, increased hospitalisation, healthcare utilisation, and cardiovascular mortality. With the loss of kidney function, there is an accumulation of uraemic toxins, of which the protein-bound toxins-indoxyl sulphate and p-cresyl sulphate-can further inflict damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular system, culminating in a vicious cycle. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians have a firm understanding of the common causes and mechanisms of toxin-mediated kidney injury, as well as their clinical presentations and histopathologic features, in order to reduce the prevalence of this pernicious condition.",
