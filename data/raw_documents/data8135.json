    "abstract": "The successful outcome of providing care to the individual with a spinal cord injury is to enable the patient to live as satisfactory and fulfilling a life as possible. How this is achieved will be different with each individual and family depending on the degree of disability, the family and social environment, and preferred life-styles. The nurse, who deals with the human response to the injury, is in an ideal position to help the patient and family realize their life potential.",
