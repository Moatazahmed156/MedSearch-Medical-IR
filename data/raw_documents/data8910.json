    "abstract": "Blood-fluid levels within the cerebral parenchyma are observed more frequently on CT and MRI in traumatic intracerebral haematomas than in those of other aetiologies. The intraparenchymal blood-fluid interface can be formed without a fluid cavity. It is suggested that the blood-fluid levels represent layering of red blood cells within areas of contusion necrosis as well as extensive contusion oedema. The more extensive the damage to brain tissue, the more often blood-fluid levels formed. A poorer outcome can be therefore predicted when an intraparenchymal blood-fluid interface is seen.",
