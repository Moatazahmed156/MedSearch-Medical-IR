    "abstract": "Catheter ablation for rhythm control is recommended in specific patient populations with paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein isolation is the cornerstone of the ablative therapy for atrial fibrillation. However, relapse is still common since the single procedure efficacy of atrial fibrillation ablation was estimated to be 60-80% in paroxysmal and 50-70% in persistent atrial fibrillation. It is important to identify predictors of successful atrial fibrillation patients ablation. In the present review, we will assess the role of available biomarkers to predict responders of an initial atrial fibrillation catheter ablation. Emphasis has been given on the role of myocardial injury biomarkers, natriuretic peptides and traditional inflammatory markers. Novel inflammatory markers, oxidative stress biomarkers and microRNAs have also been examined as predictors of a successful atrial fibrillation procedure. Notably, the impact of procedural and short-term administration of steroids, as well as the role of colchicine on preventing atrial fibrillation recurrence after ablation is thoroughly presented.",
