  "title": "Rare recurrent multiple pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma with sarcomatoid features: A case report and literature review.",
  "abstract": "Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) is a rare pulmonary tumor of pneumocytic origin, traditionally considered benign and associated with a favorable prognosis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that PSP may exhibit potentially malignant behavior and marked histopathological heterogeneity, which can complicate accurate diagnosis. These features often create diagnostic challenges during preoperative biopsy, intraoperative frozen section analysis, and postoperative histopathological evaluation. Herein, we report a rare case of recurrent, multifocal PSP exhibiting sarcomatoid features and harboring a p.E17K mutation in the AKT1 gene.",
