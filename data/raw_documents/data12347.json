  "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of regulatory RNAs with critical roles in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, including cancer. Dysregulated lncRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) contributes to oncogenic mechanisms through immune and inflammatory signaling networks, including the arachidonic acid (AA) signaling pathway. Here, we investigate the functional significance of the lncRNA PACER ( ",
