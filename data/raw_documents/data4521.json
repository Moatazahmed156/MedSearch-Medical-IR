    "abstract": "Mammographic density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. It also reduces the reliability of screening mammography. Among the population targeted by the French screening program, about 28% have dense breasts and 3% have very dense breasts. Breast density varies with age, HRT and mammographic technique. Ultrasonography for dense but otherwise clinically and mammographically normal breasts allows detection of cancers not visible on mammograms. The French program protocol allows the evaluation of results from breast US in this context with regards to the number of detected cancers and false positive rate.",
