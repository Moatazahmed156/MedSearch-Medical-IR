  "title": "The dawn of preventing respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections in children.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the commonest cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children, particularly those aged <1 year. In South Africa (SA), increased hospitalisation rates during the RSV season, including access to intensive care facilities, place a huge burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, RSV-LRTI during early childhood may lead to long-term respiratory sequelae, including recurrent wheezing, asthma, and impairment of lung function. Recently, two new RSV prevention strategies have emerged: nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, and a maternal RSV vaccine. Both strategies have shown high efficacy in reducing RSV-LRTI hospitalisation in infants and are being considered for licensure in SA. Implementation of these prevention strategies, combined with public engagement and collaboration between stakeholders, could significantly reduce RSV-related morbidity and mortality in SA.",
