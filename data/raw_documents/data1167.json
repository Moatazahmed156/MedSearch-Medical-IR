    "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      To conduct a discursive review on continuous glucose monitoring use among Black older adults and to address the issue of racial disparities in diabetes management and outcomes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a global health concern with significant complications and mortality rates. Black older adults are disproportionately affected. Initially designed for type 1 diabetes, continuous glucose monitoring has emerged as an innovative tool for type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Despite its potential, there are challenges related to adherence and digital literacy among Black older adults for managing Diabetes.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A discursive review.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Searching literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for papers published from 2017 to 2023, we explored the use of continuous glucose monitoring in Black older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, examining barriers, facilitators and challenges.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      We highlight recommendations from the literature which included barriers, facilitators, and cultural factors associated with continuous glucose monitoring use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing these challenges to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes mellitus management among Black older adults. Nurses and advanced practice registered nurses are at the forefront and can play a pivotal role in exploring and implementing interventions to promote access and proper use of continuous glucose monitoring among Black older adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
