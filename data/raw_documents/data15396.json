  "title": "A label-free fluorescent probe for deferiprone quantification in exhaled breath condensate utilizing UiO-66 MOF/ferric ions system.",
  "abstract": "This study developed a simple and label-free fluorescent probe for deferiprone quantification in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. For that, UiO-66, synthesized in a one-step process with the solvothermal method, along with ferric ions, provided a selective system for deferiprone detection. Deferiprone formed a complex with ferric ions, and the resulting complex quenched the fluorescence intensity of UiO-66 through an inner filter effect process. The probe demonstrated good sensitivity, with a detection limit of 0.005 mg.L",
