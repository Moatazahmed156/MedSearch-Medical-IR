    "abstract": "Few validated tests allow a precise aetiological diagnosis of Low Back Pain (LBP), and the difficulty of clinical evaluations could be one of the reasons to explain the lack of effectiveness in the therapeutic management of chronic LBP. However, an implication of a sensory impairment in the control of sensorimotor circuits could be suggested. Interactive and specific responses between nociceptive nerve fibres and the paraspinal musculature motor control could have clinical implications, in particular through kinematic evaluation. Following an introduction to the link between the sensory innervation of the spine and pain, we then summarise the maladaptive movement in LBP at the kinematic and neuropathological level. A clinical objectification of these kinematic adaptations at the lumbar spine level, would clarify the aetiological diagnosis causes of chronic LBP, and so help optimising therapeutic strategies by proposing a relevant and precise clinical model of this painful condition.",
