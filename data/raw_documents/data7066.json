    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer meets the criteria of a disease for which screening can be justified. The disease is most often diagnosed in advanced stages, when chances for long-term survival are poor. Yet effective treatment exists for early-stage disease, such that early detection can increase long-term survival. However, screening for early-stage ovarian cancer with the high specificity necessary for this low-prevalence disease has proven to be a challenge. This article reviews the issues of early detection of ovarian cancer, including pathology, statistical considerations, diagnostic modalities, and results of the major clinical studies undertaken.",
