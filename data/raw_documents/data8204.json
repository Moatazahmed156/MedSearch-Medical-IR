    "abstract": "Botulism has been known for about three centuries, and since its discovery, botulinum toxin has been considered one of the most powerful toxins. However, throughout the 20th century, several medical applications have been discovered, among which the treatment of spasticity stands out. Botulinum toxin is the only pharmacological treatment recommended for spasticity of strokes and cerebral palsy. Although its use as an adjuvant treatment against spasticity in spinal cord injuries is not even approved, botulinum toxin is being used against such injuries. This article describes the advances that have been made throughout history leading to the therapeutic use of botulinum toxin and, in particular, its application to the treatment of spasticity in spinal cord injury.",
