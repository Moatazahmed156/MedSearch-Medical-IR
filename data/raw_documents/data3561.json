    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was relatively obscure until outbreaks started in 2013. ZIKV is associated with neurological manifestations such as Guillan-Barrè Syndrome in adult and microcephaly in the newborn population. Although the majority of disease mechanisms of ZIKV is unclear, some information was updated with new scientific evidence. Currently, there are no approved drugs or vaccine that can be used for therapy during ZIKV infection. Based on the transmission mechanism of ZIKV, vector control and safe sex seem to be the most effective available preventive measures against ZIKV spread. This study summarized the current ZIKV epidemiology, the status of the existing pathogenic mechanism of ZIKV, the development of potential compounds and vaccines against ZIKV, and the control efforts against ZIKV.",
