    "abstract": "T-cell receptors bound to peptide-MHC molecules undergo higher-order oligomerization in solution. This observation, the low-affinity-recognition properties of T-cell receptors, and other indications that such receptors undergo rapid, serial engagement by a single ligand suggest a dynamic clustering model of T-cell signaling.",
