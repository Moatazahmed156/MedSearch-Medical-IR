    "abstract": "Both scientific evidence and popular diet trends have sought to identify the ideal diet for weight loss with strategies focused on either restricting carbohydrates or fat. While there is a strong physiologic rationale for either carbohydrate restriction or fat restriction to achieve a calorie deficit needed for weight loss, evidence from randomized controlled trials suggest either type of diet is effective for weight loss. The level of adherence, rather than macronutrient content, is the driver of successful weight loss.",
