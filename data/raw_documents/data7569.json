    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Qualitatively assess experiences of occupational pregnancy discrimination.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A fully remote phenomenological qualitative study was completed leveraging semistructured interviews with a sample of pregnant employees in the United States. Inclusion criteria included being pregnant, working at least 35 hours per week, employed at least 1 year at current employer, and without diagnosed depression/anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Participants (N = 20) were, on average, 30 years of age, worked 42.6 hours per week, self-identified as non-Hispanic black (50%), and earned least a bachelor's degree (85%). Individuals successfully identified various forms of pregnancy discrimination, believing it occurred due to systemic issues or perceptions that women are weak. Most did not report experiences of discrimination fearing retaliation or being unaware of workplace protections.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pregnancy discrimination in the workplaces comes in various forms and is an issue for some working pregnant individuals.",
