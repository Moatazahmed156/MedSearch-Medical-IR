    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Stem cells are cells with the ability to grow and differentiate into more than 200 cell types.\n    \n\n\n          Sources of data:\n        \n      \n      We review here the characteristics and potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs).\n    \n\n\n          Areas of agreement:\n        \n      \n      The differentiation ability of all stem cell types could be stimulated to obtain specialized cells that represent renewable sources of functional cells useful for cell-based therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Areas of controversy:\n        \n      \n      The proof of functional differentiated cells needs to be investigated in more detail using both in vitro and in vivo assays including animal disease models and clinical studies.\n    \n\n\n          Growing points:\n        \n      \n      Much progress has been made in the ASCs-based therapies. Meanwhile hESCs and iPSCs have dramatically emerged as novel approaches to understand pathogenesis of different diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Areas timely for developing research:\n        \n      \n      A number of new strategies become very important in regenerative medicine. However, we discuss the limitations of stem cells and latest development in the reprogramming research.",
