  "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive obstructive pulmonary vasculopathy characterized by pathological vascular remodeling driven by excessive cellular proliferation, apoptosis resistance, chronic inflammation, fibrotic deposition, and dysregulated vasoconstriction. As the disease advances, these vascular abnormalities culminate in right heart failure (RHF). The right ventricular (RV) initially undergoes compensatory hypertrophy but ultimately decompensates, manifesting as chamber dilation, impaired contractility, and progressive fibrosis. Despite the critical determinant role of RV functional reserve in patient survival and prognosis, but no clinically validated interventions directly address RV adaptation. Molecular hydrogen (H",
