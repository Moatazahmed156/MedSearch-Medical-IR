    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      The current study examined the association between insomnia and pornography addiction in Rhode Island young adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the 2024 Rhode Island Young Adult Survey (n=1008) was used. The Problematic Pornography Consumption Scale and Insomnia Severity Scale were used to assess pornography addiction and insomnia symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression models estimated main effects after adjusting for age, sexual/ gender status, race, ethnicity, and social status. Interactive effect of sexual/gender status was explored.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 56.7% of participants viewed pornography and 7.9% screened positive for addiction. Screening positive for insomnia was associated with higher odds of pornography addiction (OR[95%CI]=2.35 [1.35,4.11]), although the effect was limited to cisgender heterosexual males.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Young adult men with symptoms of insomnia should be screened for pornography addiction. Gender-specific sex education programs and male-based university support groups should be established to lower addiction risk.",
