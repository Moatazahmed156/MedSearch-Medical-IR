    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationships between father criminality, prior delinquency, and recidivism using data from 382 incarcerated juveniles assessed in Singapore's Juvenile Court in 2005. The juveniles are aged 13 to 16 years, with a mean of 14.55 years (SD = 0.93). Using Baron and Kenny's framework, this study tests the prediction that the prior delinquent behaviors of the juvenile mediate the relationship between father criminality and recidivism in a four-step process. When the juvenile's prior delinquent behaviors are included in the model, the previous significant relation between father criminality and recidivism disappears. Implications of findings in terms of applied and practical intervention and prevention work for youths in schools and those in incarceration are discussed.",
