  "title": "Comparison of transient elastography data among diabetic and non-diabetics: A study from teritiary health care centre in Kerala, India.",
  "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common metabolic disorder with a strong association to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, it is of interest to compare transient elastography findings among diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in a tertiary healthcare setting in Kerala. A total of 220 participants were assessed, of which 73 were diabetic and liver stiffness was measured using FibroScan®. Diabetic patients exhibited significantly higher mean fibrosis scores compared to non-diabetic patients (14.39 ± 14.42 vs. 8.14 ± 7.83, p=0.000). Thus, we show diabetes as a major predictor of advanced liver fibrosis, underscoring the need for early detection and targeted interventions in high-risk populations.",
