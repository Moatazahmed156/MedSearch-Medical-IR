    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Most hotel workers represent disadvantaged populations in the United States. Socioecological stress-related factors increase the risk for poor mental health outcomes, yet accounts of worker perceptions of mental health are scarce.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted five focus groups among 23 hotel room cleaners and individual interviews with six hotel managers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Four themes emerged: Mental health is related to mental illness, mental health is associated with being crazy, mental health can be controlled, and mental health is taboo yet universal.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings indicate mental health is poorly understood among this population. Education and tailored interventions are needed to address adverse mental health outcomes.",
