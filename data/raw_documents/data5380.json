    "abstract": "Traditionally, the management of epithelial ovarian cancer has been approached using a one-size-fits-all mentality. This strategy does not acknowledge the differences in epidemiology and clinical behavior of many of the histologic and molecular subgroups of ovarian cancer, specifically the rare histologies. While cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy is the mainstay of primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer as a group, further investigation of novel therapeutics is critical for improving outcomes of these rare histologies. This article focuses on the management of non-high grade serous histologies of ovarian cancer.",
