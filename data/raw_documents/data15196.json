  "title": "Successful Management of a Grade 4 Recalcitrant Sacral Pressure Ulcer in a Diabetic Patient with Adjunctive Ozonated Oil Therapy: A 12-Month Case Study.",
  "abstract": "Pressure ulcers in diabetic patients represent a significant clinical challenge due to impaired wound healing mechanisms. This case demonstrates the successful use of ozonated oil as adjunctive therapy for a recalcitrant grade 4 pressure ulcer in a complex diabetic patient with multiple comorbidities. A 60-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 8.2%), hypertension, chronic alcoholism, and liver cirrhosis developed a grade 4 sacral pressure ulcer (6.5 × 6.3 × 2.4 cm) during hospitalization. The wound showed positive cultures for  This case suggests ozonated oil may serve as an effective adjunctive therapy for chronic pressure ulcers in diabetic patients with multiple comorbidities when conventional treatments fail. The multifactorial therapeutic benefits include antimicrobial activity, enhanced tissue repair, and modulation of inflammatory responses.",
