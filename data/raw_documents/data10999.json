Baseline characteristics of 100 patients with COPD (Kano group=50; control group=50) were collected. Outcome indicators included forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV No statistical significances were observed between the two groups in baseline characteristics. After intervention, the FEV Pulmonary rehabilitation interventions based on the Kano model significantly improve lung function, discharge readiness, quality of discharge teaching, and quality of life in patients with COPD.",
