  "title": "General practice veterinarians' attitudes towards avian influenza: A COM-B analysis of barriers to backyard poultry treatment.",
  "abstract": "The recent expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 to non-avian species in the United States has intensified public health-related concerns. In Great Britain, low veterinarian confidence in seeing and treating birds creates potential barriers to HPAI diagnosis and reporting. An online survey explored general practice (GP) veterinarians' confidence in and barriers to treating avian species and understanding HPAI control measures. The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour (COM-B) behaviour change model was used to identify barriers to treating birds and diagnosing HPAI. The survey generated 72 useable responses. Only 6% reported feeling fairly/very confident seeing birds, over 83% lacked confidence in ruling out HPAI as a differential diagnosis and 17.1% were unsure how to advise clients who suspected HPAI in their flocks. The survey required an internet connection and some technical literacy. The sample size is relatively small and may over-represent veterinarians who have more confidence with poultry. GP veterinarians play critical roles in triaging, reporting and controlling HPAI. Behaviour change frameworks such as COM-B can facilitate the identification of interventions with the potential to address barriers to accurate HPAI diagnosis and reporting in Great Britain and beyond. However, these often require national-level rather than (or in addition to) individual-level action.",
