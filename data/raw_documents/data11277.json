  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an often-progressive respiratory disease associated with disabling breathlessness. Breathlessness intervention services (BIS), which coach patients to self-manage breathlessness using non-pharmacological strategies, are effective in a variety of populations, including those with cancer and serious respiratory disease. This study aimed to compare the impact of the Westmead Breathlessness Service in people with moderate to severe COPD. We analysed 113 participants randomised (1:1) with moderate/severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV Participants were aged 70.9 (±8.5) years, 50% female, mean FEV An 8-week BIS improved CRQ-Mastery, Dyspnoea and Fatigue, exertional breathlessness intensity and unpleasantness in people with severe COPD.",
