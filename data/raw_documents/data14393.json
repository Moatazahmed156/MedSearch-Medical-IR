  "title": "Radiotherapy for Other Nonmalignant Diseases.",
  "abstract": "Radiotherapy is increasingly used for benign diseases, especially in Germany, where over 50% of radiation treatments address nonmalignant conditions such as osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis, and Dupuytren's disease. Low-dose regimens have shown good efficacy in pain reduction and disease stabilization, with minimal toxicity. For rarer indications like Gorham-Stout disease, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and lymphatic fistulas, evidence is limited to case series and retrospective studies. Randomized trials remain scarce, and further research is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes and patient quality of life. Radiotherapy appears safe when used appropriately, though concerns about late effects require continued monitoring. For rare diseases, collaborative data collection and biological studies may help address current evidence gaps.",
