    "abstract": "Advances in stem cell biology and the understanding of factors that determine lung stem cell self-renewal have enabled long-term in vitro culture of human lung cells derived from airway basal and alveolar type II cells. Improved capability to expand and study primary cells long term, including in clonal cultures that are recently derived from a single cell, will allow experiments that address fundamental questions about lung homeostasis and repair, as well as translational questions in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer research. Here, we provide a brief history of postnatal lung epithelial cell culture and describe recent methodological advances. We further discuss the applications of primary cultures in defining \"normal\" epithelium, in modeling lung disease, and in future cell therapies.",
