    "abstract": "Case:\n        \n      \n      Xanthogranulomatous inflammation of the prostate is a rare condition that can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and may be mistaken for adenocarcinoma. It is often seen on prostate biopsy, but can usually be treated conservatively with temporary catheterization, alpha blockade, and allowing time for improvement. We present a case of a 78-year-old man found to have a 318 g prostate secondary to xanthogranulomatous inflammation.\n    \n\n\n          Outcome:\n        \n      \n      After a negative MRI-guided biopsy to rule out malignancy, the patient was treated successfully with open suprapubic prostatectomy with significant improvement in voiding symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This case highlights the ability of this clinical and pathologic entity to cause significant prostatic enlargement, how it is diagnosed, and the possible role of surgical therapy in its treatment.",
