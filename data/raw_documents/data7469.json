    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States; however, recent data demonstrates a decline in the mortality rate, which may be attributed to early detection from screening programs combined with effective therapies for early stage disease. As a result of the prevalence of breast cancer and its association with highly emotional issues, screening recommendations have aroused debate in the scientific, public, and legislative domains. A general consensus supports breast cancer screening among women between the ages of 50 and 70; however, much controversy exists regarding screening for women age 40 to 49 or above age 70. This article explores the issues involved in determining breast cancer screening recommendations among asymptomatic women with average risk in the United States.",
