    "abstract": "Visceral larva migrans (VLM) occurs due to migration of the second stage of larvae of nematodes through human viscera. It is an underdiagnosed entity which commonly affects the liver as eosinophilic abscesses and appears as coalescing, conglomerated cavities on imaging. This case report details the sonographic and CT features of an 8 year old female patient with right upper quadrant pain and peripheral eosinophilia on laboratory reports, diagnosed as a case of VLM on biopsy. Imaging of VLM shows overlap with neoplastic lesions and other infective pathologies hence this case aims to highlight the clinical, laboratory, and radiological features to help narrow the differential diagnosis.",
