    "abstract": "Cancer is a very complex disease, where cell alterations (i.e. gene mutations, dysregulated signaling pathway(s) and epigenetic modifications) contribute to its development and progression. Elucidating the connections among these cell modifications is a critical challenge, in order to understand the mechanisms which are activated from cancer cells to survive and proliferate. Interesting, Prof. Peng Hou and colleagues, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, identified unknown epigenetic mechanisms and their involvement in the tumorigenesis of B-RAF(V600E)-driven cancer.",
