    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become one of the fastest growing public health problems worldwide. The disease is believed to involve a complex process involving genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The human intestine harbors hundreds of trillions of bacteria, as well as bacteriophage particles, viruses, fungi, and archaea, which constitute a complex and dynamic ecosystem referred to as the gut microbiota. Increasing evidence has indicated changes in the gut microbiota composition or function in type 2 diabetic patients. An analysis of 'dysbiosis' enables the detection of alterations in the specific bacteria, clusters of bacteria, or bacterial functions associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. These bacteria are involved predominantly in the control of inflammation and energy homeostasis. This review attempts to show that the gut microbiota are important factors for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and are important for the treatment of gut microbiota dysbiosis through bariatric surgery, fecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, and probiotics.",
