    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Over the past decade, mentalization-based treatment (MBT) approaches have been developed specifically for children, adolescents and families. This study provides a systematic review of MBT applicable to both children and families.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Five databases were searched to identify reports of MBT studies published up to February 2020. Studies were screened and reported according to PRISMA guidelines.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 34 studies were included in this review. Of these, 14 focused on parent-child dyads, two on child therapy, seven applied the approach to parenting, four evaluated the application of MBT to the school environment and seven focused on adolescent populations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Despite methodological shortcomings and heterogeneity in design, the existing literature does provide tentative support for the use of MBT approaches for these populations, specifically in increasing mentalizing/reflective functioning. Further controlled and methodologically rigorous studies are required.",
