    "abstract": "This review describes clinical characteristics, mode of inheritance, and molecular genetic testing for the following monogenic kidney diseases: polycystic kidney disease, Alport syndrome, autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and nephronophthisis. The same is described for steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome, kidney stones and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, which in some cases have a monogenic cause. Knowledge of possibilities within molecular genetic testing may help more kidney disease patients to receive a specific diagnosis.",
