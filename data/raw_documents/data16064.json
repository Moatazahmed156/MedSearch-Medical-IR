  "title": "Living circumstances and interactions with same-aged peers: Associations with alcohol use among college students during COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "This study sought to better understand the relationship between alcohol use, living arrangement, and interactions with same-aged peers among college students after campus closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analytic sample consisted of 861 students. College students in a longitudinal study were invited to complete an additional survey in July 2020. Living with family after campus closure was associated with decreased odds of drinking. In-person interactions with peers who did not attend the same college was associated with greater odds of any alcohol use; texting with these peers was associated with greater average and maximum drinks. After campus closure, living with family was protective against any alcohol use, whereas interacting with peers who did not attend the same college appeared more influential on drinking. Time away from college campus, including during socially restrictive periods, has implications for alcohol use and peer influence.",
