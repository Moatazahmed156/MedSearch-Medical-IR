    "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the MTSS1 gene expression in patients with acute leukemia. Patients & methods: MTSS1 gene expression was quantified in 120 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, by quantitative reverse transcription PCR at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy therapy. Results: Baseline MTSS1 gene expression was significantly higher in acute leukemia patients compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Acute leukemia patients with low baseline MTSS1 gene expression at diagnosis have significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with higher expression (p < 0.001 for both). Conclusion: Downregulation of MTSS1 gene expression at diagnosis was associated with poor outcome in either cytogenetic acute myeloid leukemia or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
