  "title": "Association of Achilles Tendon Thickness with Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in Non -Familial Hypercholesterolemia.",
  "abstract": "Achilles tendon xanthomas are a characteristic feature of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) has been associated with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in FH. However, its relevance in non-FH remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between ATT and CAD severity in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without FH. A total of 194 patients (mean age: 69.1±11.9 years) with ACS without FH were retrospectively investigated and divided into two groups: single-vessel disease (SVD) or multivessel disease (MVD). ATT was measured using ultrasonography (US-ATT) and radiography (Xp-ATT). The association between ATT and CAD severity was evaluated. Of the total, 107 patients (55.2%) had SVD, and 87 (44.8%) had MVD. Mean US-ATT and Xp-ATT values were 5.0±0.6 mm and 6.4±1.2 mm, respectively. ATT was significantly greater in the MVD group than in the SVD group (US-ATT: 5.2 mm vs. 4.8 mm, p＜0.01; Xp-ATT: 6.6 mm vs. 6.1 mm, p = 0.01) and correlated with the SYNTAX score (US-ATT: r = 0.30, p＜0.01; Xp-ATT: r = 0.19, p = 0.02). Multivariable analysis identified US-ATT as an independent predictor of MVD (odds ratio: 2.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.46-5.01; p＜0.01). In patients with ACS without FH, ATT was significantly associated with CAD severity. This suggests that ATT, particularly US-ATT, may serve as a practical, non-invasive marker for cardiovascular risk stratification.",
