    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To review the current status, recent advances, and ongoing research related to screening, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of gastric cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      Professional journals, research studies, and review articles relating to gastric cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Surgical resection is the gold standard curative treatment for gastric cancer; however, diagnosis is often at later stages of disease, leaving poor long-term survival rates. An emphasis has been placed on developing more effective chemotherapy regimens; currently, fluorouracil is the standard single agent used for gastric cancer. Radiation therapy has been used for palliative symptom management.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for nursing practice:\n        \n      \n      An understanding of current treatment modalities for gastric cancer will help oncology nurses assist their patients throughout their course of treatment with education, nutritional support, and symptom control.",
