    "abstract": "Lung cancer still accounts for the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and despite the emerging advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques it remains to be a serious global public health concern. Micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are responsible for invasion and metastasis of various tumors including lung cancer which underscores the necessity of understanding their functions. Areas covered: Herein, we aim to summarize the recent advances made in our understanding of the miRNAs with special reference to lung cancer. Moreover, the role of miRNAs in crucial cellular processes will be elucidated. Various applications of the miRNAs would be explained and different kinds of them would be discussed to delineate their significance in lung cancer biology, therapy and diagnosis. Expert commentary: the miRNA study in the field of respiratory disease and specially lung cancer has emerged lately. Given the several miRNAs, which are in the clinical trials, this field is passing through its maturation phase which ultimately could rise to a robust tool for lung cancer therapy, diagnosis and prevention.",
