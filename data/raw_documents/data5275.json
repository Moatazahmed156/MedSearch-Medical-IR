    "abstract": "The present review focuses on the most recently published English language literature, and addresses results and complications associated with the laparoscopic approach to urinary incontinence, anterior vaginal wall prolapse, and lower urinary tract injury. Laparoscopic Burch procedures continue to show equal efficacy, but lower morbidity as compared with conventional open techniques. Lower urinary tract injuries may also be managed effectively using the same techniques as those employed in open procedures. Laparoscopy continues to be considered a mode of surgical access, and is effective in treating urinary incontinence, anterior vaginal wall prolapse, and lower urinary tract injuries.",
