    "abstract": "Several unique features of childhood anatomy and physiology mandate an approach to evaluation and treatment of multiply injured children that differs from that applied to adults. Details of this approach have been presented, with particular emphasis, on early, aggressive multimodal imaging, nonoperative management of splenic, hepatic, renal, and duodenal injuries, and specific aids in early precise definition of extent of injury (contrast-enhanced CT, serum levels of hepatic enzymes, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage). The outcome of this approach preserves maximum function and minimizes morbidity when performed in an institution having the requisite supportive resources.",
