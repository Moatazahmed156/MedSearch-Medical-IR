  "title": "Trimethyl Chitosan-Engineered Cod Skin Peptide Nanosystems Alleviate Behavioral and Cognitive Deficits in D-Galactose-Induced Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with limited effective treatments. Cod skin collagen peptides (CSCPs) have neuroprotective potential for AD but face poor bioavailability-due to gastrointestinal enzyme cleavage and hepatic first-pass metabolism-prompting this study to develop a nanodelivery system to enhance CSCPs' efficacy. Trimethyl chitosan (TMC)-based CSCP-loaded nanoparticles (CSCPs-NPs) were synthesized via ionic gelation, characterized for physicochemical properties, and tested in a D-galactose-induced AD mouse model (six groups: normal control, model, CSCPs low/high dose, blank NPs, CSCPs-NPs) using behavioral tests, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. CSCPs-NPs had a hydrodynamic diameter of 93.25 ± 21.52 nm, polydispersity index of 0.18 ± 0.13, 61.17% encapsulation efficiency, and sustained 24 h release. In AD mice, CSCPs-NPs significantly improved cognitive function and motor coordination, reduced hippocampal atrophy, preserved neurons, and mitigated oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis (upregulated Bcl-2, downregulated Bax)-effects matching high-dose free CSCPs. This TMC-based nanoformulation enhances CSCPs' bioavailability and provides a promising strategy for AD intervention.",
