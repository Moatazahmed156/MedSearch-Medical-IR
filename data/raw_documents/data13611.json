  "title": "Dissecting the genetic relationship between severe mental disorders and autoimmune diseases.",
  "abstract": "Severe mental disorders have been linked to immune system dysfunction. While a genetic association between mental disorders and autoimmune diseases has been suggested, their genetic relationship remains incompletely understood. Utilizing a complementary set of statistical analyses, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the genetic architecture between severe mental disorders (major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ)) and seven autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes), involving a total of 667,518 cases from 10 genome-wide association studies. While MD was positively genetically correlated with five autoimmune diseases, BD and SCZ were only positively correlated with IBD, suggesting differences in the genetic signal shared with autoimmunity across these mental disorders. A considerable fraction of genetic variants influencing autoimmune diseases (range 17.1-88.4 %) was estimated to overlap with mental disorders; however, this constitutes only a minor part of genetic variants influencing the more polygenic mental disorders. Finally, we identified 172 genetic loci jointly affecting mental disorders and autoimmune diseases, implicating both lipid metabolism and TNF signaling. In conclusion, MD, BD, and SCZ have a small but distinct genetic overlap with autoimmune diseases, which may inform new possible immune targets for treatment in mental illness.",
