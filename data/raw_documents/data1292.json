    "abstract": "The global burden of atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is considerable, and prevalence rates are increasing. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation; however, diabetes also influences the management and prognosis of atrial fibrillation. In the following article, the authors describe the association between diabetes and atrial fibrillation; specifically, the significance of diabetes on the risk of atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke and bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation. In addition, the authors evaluate the risks and outcomes of heart failure and the success rates of both ablation and cardioversion in atrial fibrillation patients with diabetes. Finally, this article describes the association of HbA1c levels with the management and prognosis of atrial fibrillation patients.",
