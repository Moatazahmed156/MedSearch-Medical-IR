    "abstract": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles involved in several biological and pathological molecules and can carry many bioactive materials to target cells. They work as important mediators of cell-cell communication and play essential roles in many diseases, especially in cancer. Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages involving widespread peritoneal dissemination, resulting in poor prognosis. Emerging evidence has shown that exosomes play vital roles throughout the progression of ovarian cancer. Moreover, the development of engineered exosome-based therapeutic applications- including drug delivery systems, biomolecular targets and immune therapy-has increased drastically. Herein, we review the functional features of exosomes in ovarian cancer progression and the therapeutic application potential of exosomes as novel cancer treatments.",
