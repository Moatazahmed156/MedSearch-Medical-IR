    "abstract": "Several reports have shown that the incidence of prostate cancer is on the increase and that more men would be diagnosed of prostate cancer in the next decades. Many approaches are being applied towards reducing the cases of prostate cancer, especially in the very rich countries. However, these have not been effective due to the poor current understanding of the pathophysiology of prostate carcinogenesis. The current work presents a review of how chronic infection and inflammation may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.",
