  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events (CVE). We assessed whether circulating levels and genetic variability of endocrine fibroblast growth factors (FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) could predict CV risk in these patients. In 1,182 participants (815 CKD patients and 367 controls), plasma FGF concentrations and 46 gene variants were analyzed, with participants followed-up for a mean of 37.6 ± 25.7 months for CVE. Clustering based on combined scores for all three FGF concentrations correlated strongly with CKD severity (",
