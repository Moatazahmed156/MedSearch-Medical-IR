  "title": "Elucidation of population-based bacterial adaptation to antimicrobial treatment by single-cell sequencing analysis of the gut microbiome of a hospital patient.",
  "abstract": "In this study, we used single-cell sequencing to analyze the gut microbiome of an adult male patient with acute cerebral hemorrhage undergoing antibiotic treatment. We identified 92 bacterial species, including 23 Firmicutes and one archaeon from Methanobacteriota, along with 69 unclassified strains. Single-cell sequencing effectively detected bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly in unclassified species, and traced the evolution of these genes across diverse bacterial taxa. Notably, the ",
