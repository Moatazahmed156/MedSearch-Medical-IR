  "title": "Diffuse hepatic artery dilation: an uncommon manifestation of early cirrhosis.",
  "abstract": "We report a case of a 65-year-old man with diffuse hepatic artery dilation. Laboratory tests and imaging studies indicated signs of chronic liver disease. Specific measurements of dilated vessels are provided, and relevant diagnostic and therapeutic considerations are discussed. The patient was treated with common hepatoprotective agents and the progression of cirrhosis was prevented. Importantly, this case emphasizes the need to distinguish hepatic artery dilation from other vascular anomalies, particularly in the absence of portal hypertension, through high-resolution imaging and clinical correlation.",
