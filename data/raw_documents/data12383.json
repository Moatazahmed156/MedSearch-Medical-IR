  "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor-targeting bio-orthogonally conjugated bortezomib (BTZ) was site-specifically delivered against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Through a rational screening, three ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) variants (mutant RBD1, mutant RBD2, and mutant RBD3) were identified to introduce the genetic linker DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine) to bio-orthogonally load BTZ through a catechol-boronate ester with enhanced receptor binding. Extensive biophysical characterization, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, B",
