  "title": "Peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis in a patient with T-cell lymphoma: Diagnostic pitfalls and radiologic correlation.",
  "abstract": "Peritoneal tuberculosis (TB) can closely mimic peritoneal carcinomatosis on cross-sectional imaging, creating a major diagnostic dilemma in oncologic patients. We describe a 49-year-old man with refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma who presented with progressive abdominal distension; contrast-enhanced CT showed bilateral pleural effusions, large-volume ascites, smooth peritoneal thickening with focal nodularity, omental infiltration, and necrotic mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Ascitic fluid testing revealed a lymphocyte-predominant exudate with elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA) and PCR positivity for ",
