    "abstract": "Family history is an important risk factor of gastric cancer. No guidelines have been developed that target gastric cancer with a family history; only hereditary familial gastric cancer is targeted. We review the available evidence regarding the familial aggregation mechanisms of gastric cancer and a strategy of screening and surveillance for gastric cancer in individuals with a positive family history of the disease. As there is a synergic effect of Helicobacter pylori infection and family history on the increased risk of gastric cancer, Helicobacter pylori eradication should be considered in all infected individuals with a family history of gastric cancer. Currently, there is weak evidence indicating that suitable timing to initiate eradication therapy is at the age of 20, when precancerous lesions, including significant gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, have not been established. Reasonable timing to initiate screening for gastric cancer in individuals with a family history of gastric cancer is 10 years prior to the age of onset of gastric cancer in affected relatives. A 2-year surveillance interval, instead of the 3-year interval recommended in the present guidelines, may be better to detect early gastric cancer in those individuals who have already developed precancerous gastric lesions.",
