  "title": "Biopsy-Driven Synovial Pathophenotyping in RA: A New Approach to Personalized Treatment.",
  "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been constantly evolving for decades, pointing towards early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Synovial biopsy has emerged as a pivotal tool in precision medicine, transitioning from a research procedure to a clinically feasible approach. Modern ultrasound-guided techniques allow safe, reproducible access to inflamed joints, enabling direct analysis of the synovial tissue, which reveals biological heterogeneity undetectable in peripheral blood. Histological scoring, including the Krenn synovitis score, discriminates inflammatory from non-inflammatory pathology, supporting targeted escalation of immunosuppressive therapy. Molecular and histological profiling has defined distinct synovial pathotypes-lympho-myeloid, diffuse-myeloid, and fibroid/pauci-immune-with reproducible associations to therapeutic responsiveness. Moreover, biopsy-driven trials, such as R4RA and STRAP, demonstrate that pathotype-guided strategies can predict outcomes: diffuse-myeloid synovitis responds to IL-6 receptor blockade, lympho-myeloid synovitis to B cell depletion, and fibroid synovitis exhibits multidrug resistance. In difficult-to-treat RA, synovial biopsy differentiates inflammatory from non-inflammatory drivers of persistent symptoms, providing a rational basis for therapy selection. Ongoing biomarker-driven initiatives, including PRECISion and 3TR Precis-The-RA, aim to embed biopsy findings into clinical decision-making. In this review, it is underscored that the integration of histology, molecular profiling, and clinical context positions synovial biopsy as a patient-centered precision approach, guiding individualized therapy and bridging RA stratification with clinical practice.",
