  "title": "Risk Factors and Outcomes of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Case-Control Study of the United States Renal Data System.",
  "abstract": "Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). We aimed to determine risk factors and outcomes of the disease using a large national database. We first conducted a nested case-control study to identify risk factors associated with PJP in patients who received a kindey transplant from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2019. We then performed a matched cohort study to evaluate clinical outcomes following the diagnosis of PJP. We matched 407 patients with PJP to 1,625 uninfected controls. PJP was diagnosed at a median time of 55 months after transplant (85.3% of cases occurred after the first post-transplant year). Longer duration of pre-transplant hemodialysis and higher Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) were independent risk factors for disease. All-cause mortality within 12 months after infection was 25.8%. Older age, higher ECI and chronic pulmonary disease were predictors of mortality. PJP was associated with an increased risk of mortality [Hazard ratio (HR) 5.47 (2.46 - 12.15), p <0.001] and allograft failure [HR 5.58 (3.31 - 9.42), p <0.001] within one year after infection. Our study highlights the importance of timely transplantation after initiation of hemodialysis and the impact of PJP on survival and allograft function.",
