    "abstract": "The prognostic significance of histologic type is unclear in patients with gastric cancer. However, the regimen has been actually selected by histologic type from clinical reports and clinical experiences. The differentiated type is related to metastasis in the liver and the undifferentiated type to the peritoneum metastasis. The S-1+CDDP combined therapy that is standard treatment has no difference in antitumor effect by the histologic type factor. CPT-11 and CPT-11+ CDDP combined therapy, which is the second-line therapy, can be expected to be effective in a gastric cancer patient with target lesion like liver metastasis. With paclitaxel and docetaxel, the second-line therapy, the effect is expected in a gastric cancer patient without a target lesion like peritoneal metastasis.",
