    "abstract": "In normal young minipigs thin slices of autologous mesenteric or superficial inguinal lymph nodes were implanted either in the greater omentum or subcutaneously in the groin region. The regeneration was studied histologically and connections between the afferent lymphatics and the regenerated tissue were checked. In the greater omentum, no regenerated lymph node tissue was found. In the inguinal region, lymphoid tissue with all the typical lymph node compartments was identified following antigenic stimulation in the draining area. Sinuses, germinal centres with a lymphatic corona, and a paracortex with typical high endothelial venules were seen. There was evidence of afferent lymphatics, e.g., macroscopically visible lymphatics, the occurrence of a subcutaneously injected dye, the effect of antigenic stimulation and a normal lymph node structure. Avascular transplants of autologous lymph node fragments regenerate subcutaneously, possibly providing a future technique for treating lymphoedema after radical excision or irradiation of lymph nodes.",
