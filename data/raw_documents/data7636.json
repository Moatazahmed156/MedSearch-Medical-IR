    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      To understand family nurse practitioner (FNP) students' academic experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty developed an online reflective discussion board assignment. The richness of the responses prompted faculty to gather data and analyze themes.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of FNP students regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their academic experience. Participants were asked to answer four open-ended questions in a discussion board to address the research question. Responses of consenting students were analyzed qualitatively using open, axial, and selective coding.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Four main themes emerged: worry and fear, cyclical stress, mitigation of stress, and personal growth of resilience and empathy. Students emphasized that faculty support strategies mitigated stress and anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Understanding students' experience is crucial to facilitating academic success. Faculty in similar situations could better support their students through clear communication, and providing flexibility and opportunities for self-reflection. [J Nurs Educ. 2021;60(8):449-452.].",
