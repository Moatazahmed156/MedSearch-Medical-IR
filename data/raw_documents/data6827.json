    "abstract": "Scales of quality of life have only recently been imposed in cardiology. Essentially an Anglosaxon invention, they have been used for evaluating most treatment of cardiac failure. The main qualities of a good quality of life questionnaire are its sensitivity, its reproducibility and its validity. The contents of the questionnaire, particularly the relationship between items concerning symptoms and those concerning the psychological aspects of the disease, have a great influence on the quality of results. The \"Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire\" of the University of Minnesota is the most validated questionnaire at present. As with most other methods of therapeutic assessment in cardiology, the most recently obtained results from large multicenter trials, seem to show a much smaller benefit of drugs reputed to be effective in this condition, with respect to the quality of life of patients. This justifies: the continuation of validation of these questionnaires, a reflection on the efficacy of classical management of these patients.",
