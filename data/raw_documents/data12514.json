  "title": "Beyond the Plate: Unveiling the Association Between Meat Consumption and Colorectal Cancer Risk.",
  "abstract": "The consumption of meat, particularly processed and red meat, is believed to increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis to clarify the association between the consumption of red meat, processed meat, and white meat with the risk of CRC, thereby providing a scientific foundation for CRC prevention. As of March 2024, we comprehensively searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases for relevant studies. A random-effects model was utilized to calculate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), while the I This study includes a total of 31 studies, comprising 12 cohort studies and 19 case-control studies. In cohort studies, the associations observed were as follows: red meat: OR = 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02-1.20), processed meat: OR = 1.17 (95% CI: 1.09-1.25), and white meat: OR = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72-1.19). In case-control studies, the associations were as follows: red meat: OR = 1.12 (95% CI: 1.03-1.20), processed meat: OR = 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.23), and white meat: OR = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.85-1.24). The consumption of red and processed meat demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation with an elevated risk of CRC; however, the consumption of white meat did not exhibit such an association.",
