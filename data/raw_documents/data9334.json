  "title": "The association between mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use and diabetes occurrence and progression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) effects on glucose metabolism and diabetes risk are inconsistently reported. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between MRA use and glycaemic profile change as well as the risk of diabetes occurrence and progression. Eligible studies enrolling adult patients receiving spironolactone, eplerenone or finerenone for any clinical indication were included. The primary outcomes were new-onset diabetes mellitus and change in HbA1c (%) levels. A secondary outcome was alterations in glucose levels. This meta-analysis of 20 studies evaluated the effects of MRAs on glycaemic parameters. Spironolactone significantly reduced endpoint HbA1c (%) compared to placebo  (mean difference -0.27%, 95% CI: -0.38 to -0.15; P < 0.00001; I Spironolactone use is associated with modest but statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and glucose levels compared to placebo, suggesting a potential glycaemic benefit.",
