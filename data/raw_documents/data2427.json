    "abstract": "Management of endometrial cancer, an adenocarcinoma of the endometrium which occupies most uterine corpus neoplasms, including uterine sarcomas, has been more relevant due to its increasing incidence. Extensive research on tumorigenesis molecular mechanisms and molecular characterization across cancers has brought paradigm shifts in the treatment of various malignant tumors. Endometrial cancer treatment has been traditionally guided according to the disease extent or histology types, while recent studies on molecular features have led to the introduction of targeted agents into clinical use, along with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in patients with recurrent or metastatic disease. Considering the proven efficacy and relatively tolerable toxicities of targeted therapies across malignant tumors, improvement of treatment outcomes is also expected in endometrial cancer by adopting an individualized therapy depending on the specific molecular features. Efficacy assessment of new biological agents is still ongoing based on previous preclinical data on endometrial cancer molecular features. Here, endometrial cancer molecular characterization will be reviewed, and then, we will introduce preclinical data, directing the adoption of new biological agents.",
