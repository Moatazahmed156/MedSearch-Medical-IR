    "abstract": "Familial ovarian cancer is described as a familial aggregation of ovarian cancer. The disease is heterogeneous, with at least three genotypes prodisposing to distinctive hereditary syndrome, site-specific ovarian cancer, wherein familial cancer risk is restricted to ovarian carcinoma; breast/ovary carcinoma syndrome, that is ovarian carcinoma in association with carcinoma of the breast; and Lynch syndrome II, characterized by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer with proximal colonic cancer predominance, endometrial carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. When a familial aggregation of ovarian cancer is observed, unaffected women in the family should have periodic gynecologic examinations, including cytologic and ultrasonographic, radiologic studies and magnetic resonance imaging, in an effort to detect preinvasive ovarian cancer. Until more reliable diagnostic methods are developed, however, the physician should consider the advisability of prophylactic oophorectomy and oral contraceptives when counseling women who have several close relatives with ovarian cancer.",
