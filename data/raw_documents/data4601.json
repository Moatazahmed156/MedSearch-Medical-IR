    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors besides deficits in social communication. Syndromic ASD is a subset of ASD caused by underlying genetic disorders, most commonly Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Rett Syndrome (RTT). Various mutations and consequent malfunctions in core signaling pathways have been identified in ASD, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). A growing body of evidence suggests a key role of GSK3 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of ASD and its related disorders. Here, we provide a synopsis of the implication of GSK3 in ASD, FXS, and RTT as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD.",
