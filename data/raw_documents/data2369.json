    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is now the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with incidence rates rising globally. Treatment strategies have historically been focused on a combination of surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy based primarily on histology and extent of tumor. Advances in the evaluation and treatment of endometrial cancers are occurring at a rapid pace, with a new focus on genomic profiling and targeted therapies. Surgical removal of the tumor remains the mainstay of therapy, but adjuvant treatments are a shifting paradigm. In the realm of gynecologic malignancies, endometrial cancer leads in the evolution of precision medicine. The ability to analyze patients, tumors, and therapy has increased over the past 10 years. Gaps in knowledge about racial and ethnic disparities, as well as pre-invasive disease prevention, are closing. This review describes the advances in endometrial cancer with a focus on people at risk, molecular classification, and modern therapeutic strategies.",
