    "abstract": "Gastric cancer, despite its declining incidence rate, is still the second cause of cancer-related death worldwide, killing 750,000 people each year and remaining the second common type of cancer. The best examples of inflammation-associated cancer in human beings may be gastric cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the inflammation in gastric carcinogenesis is important for developing new strategies against gastric cancer.",
