  "title": "UV induces common cutaneous amyloid-like melanosomal protein aggregates.",
  "abstract": "Misfolding of aggregation-prone proteins underpins diseases known as proteinopathies. One of these proteins, alpha-synuclein, is a component of aggregates in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease. The melanosomal protein PMEL, which forms physiologic amyloid scaffold structures on which melanin is organized in melanosomes, similarly ectopically accumulates in the dermis in many forms of cutaneous hyperpigmentation. Here, we demonstrate in a wide range of common clinical pigmentary disorders, as well as in primary melanocyte and mouse models examined by molecular, proteomic, and electron microscopic tools, that melanocytic alpha-synuclein is a prominent component of intracellular protein aggregates bound to similar proteins as in Parkinson's disease, as well as melanized extracellular protein deposits. Using the Real Time Quaking-Induced Conversion Assay (RT-QuIC), we demonstrate that UV induces misfolded melanosomal proteins to self-propagate, augmenting this pathology in prion-like fashion. CUT&RUN chromatin profiling and single-cell RNA-seq demonstrate that melanocytes utilize microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-regulated autophagy to counteract protein aggregation, identifying aggregate removal as a core function of tanning. In contrast to extracellular aggregation, impaired intracellular aggregate removal contributes to melanocyte senescence, which conversely exacerbates chronic hypopigmentation and photoaging-related discoloration. These findings identify melanosomal proteinopathy as a common contributor to melanocyte dysfunction and suggest aggregate-focused management approaches.",
