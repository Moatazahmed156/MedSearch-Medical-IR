    "abstract": "Within the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, the genome organizes into a series of orderly structures that impose important influences on gene regulation. T lymphocytes, crucial players in adaptive immune responses, undergo intricate transcriptional remodeling upon activation, leading to differentiation into specific effector and memory T cell subsets. Recent evidence suggests that T cell activation is accompanied by dynamic changes in genome architecture at multiple levels, providing a unique biological context to explore the functional relevance and molecular mechanisms of 3D genome organization. Here, we summarize recent advances that link the reorganization of genome architecture to the remodeling of transcriptional programs and conversion of cell fates during T cell activation and differentiation. We further discuss how various chromatin architecture regulators, including CCCTC-binding factor and several transcription factors, collectively modulate the genome architecture during this process.",
