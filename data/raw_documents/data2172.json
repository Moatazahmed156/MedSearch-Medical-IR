    "abstract": "The spinal cord is a clinically eloquent site within the central nervous system, containing important sensorimotor tracts confined within a small cross-sectional area. Damage to the spinal cord may be caused by a wide range of pathologies, and can result in profound functional disability. Characterization of the structural integrity of the spinal cord can be assessed using diffusion tensor imaging methods. Development and application of this technique may improve our understanding of the nature and evolution of structural damage in spinal cord disease. Possible developments include improved detection of ischaemic lesions, clarification of the relationship between clinical disability and structural damage to the cord and monitoring of anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective therapies. In this review current technical aspects, clinical applications and the suggested future development of spinal cord diffusion imaging are discussed.",
