    "abstract": "Lower urinary tract dysfunction is an umbrella diagnosis that covers difficulty evacuating urine from the bladder. In its most simple form, it is either an inability to store urine or an inability to empty the bladder of urine appropriately. The normal and the abnormal bladder, the role of urodynamics in evaluation of lower urinary tract dysfunction, and the medical and behavioral management of some of these disorders are reviewed.",
