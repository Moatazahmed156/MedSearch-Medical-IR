    "abstract": "The discovery of microbiome metabolites has enlivened the field of fecal transplantation for therapeutic purposes. However, the transfer of pathogenic living organisms was recently observed to limit its therapeutic potential by increasing the risk of infection. Lipids produced by gut microbiota enter the circulation and control many phenotypic changes associated with microbiota composition. Fecal lipids significantly impact the regulation of several cell signaling pathways, including inflammation. Focusing on these molecules, we review how bioactive gut microbiota-associated lipids affect cellular functioning and clinical outcome. Here, we interrogate whether the gut microbiota can be considered a cutting-edge biotechnological tool for rapid metabolic engineering of meaningful lipids to offer a novel personalized therapy.",
