  "title": "Putative Role of Fatty Acid Metabolic Therapy Using Ketogenic Diet and HIF-1α Inhibition in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Evidence from an In Vitro Study.",
  "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) enhances cancer cell survival in hypoxic conditions. The ketogenic diet (KGD), characterized by low-carbohydrate and high-fat intake, has been widely used for epilepsy treatment and reported to have antitumor potential. However, its impact on hypoxic cancer cells remains poorly understood. This study examined the effects of combining the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 with the KD formula KetoCal",
