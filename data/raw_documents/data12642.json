  "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Organoid-Based Disease Modeling: A New Frontier in Precision Medicine.",
  "abstract": "Organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional (3D) cellular structures derived from stem cells. They can mimic the anatomical and functional properties of real organs. They have transformed in vitro disease modeling by closely replicating the structural and functional characteristics of human tissues. The complexity and variability of organoid-derived data pose significant challenges for analysis and clinical translation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial enabler, offering scalable and high-throughput tools for interpreting imaging data, integrating multi-omics profiles, and guiding experimental workflows. This review aims to discuss how AI is reshaping organoid-based research by enhancing morphological image analysis, enabling dynamic modeling of organoid development, and facilitating the integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics for disease classification. Moreover, AI is increasingly used to support drug screening and personalize therapeutic strategies by analyzing patient-derived organoids. The integration of AI with organoid-on-chip systems further allows for real-time feedback and physiologically relevant modeling. Drawing on peer-reviewed literature from the past decade, Furthermore, CNNs have been used to analyze colonoscopy and histopathological images in colorectal cancer with over 95% diagnostic accuracy. We examine key tools, innovations, and case studies that illustrate this evolving interface. As this interdisciplinary field matures, the future of AI-integrated organoid platforms depends on establishing open data standards, advancing algorithms, and addressing ethical and regulatory considerations to unlock their clinical and translational potential.",
