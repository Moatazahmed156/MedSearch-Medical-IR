  "abstract": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide released by sensory neurons, plays an emerging role in immune regulation, yet its function in adaptive immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the CGRP-RAMP1 pathway as a key intrinsic regulator of CD4 House dust mite (HDM) was used to induce allergic sensitization in mice. CGRP CGRP These findings suggest a neuroimmune axis in which CGRP-RAMP1 pathway restrains allergic sensitization by directly modulating the immunobiology of CD4",
