  "title": "The Rise of Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Trauma Follow-Up Care and Its Long-Term Outcomes: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Telemedicine has rapidly transformed healthcare delivery, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated its use across nearly all medical specialties. Virtual consultations have become an integral part of patient follow-up and management in orthopedic trauma care. This review explores the evolution and current applications of telemedicine in orthopaedic trauma, highlighting its implementation and patient and clinician responses. We examine evidence comparing virtual and in-person care in terms of clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. This review also discusses the common barriers to adoption, practical solutions, and strategies that promote successful integration. Finally, we consider the long-term sustainability of telemedicine platforms and outline future directions for virtual orthopaedic trauma services. Together, these insights aim to guide ongoing efforts to optimize patient care delivery in the digital era.",
