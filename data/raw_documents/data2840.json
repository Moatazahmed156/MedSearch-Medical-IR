    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between the psychosocial characteristics of juvenile detainees in three different juvenile detention centers in Türkiye and their environmental conditions. Conducted from the perspective of ecological systems theory, the research aimed to evaluate the effects of reciprocal interaction between a juvenile's internal state and their external environment on rehabilitation. Analyses conducted using methods such as one-way ANOVA and multivariate path analysis revealed a strong relationship between psychological well-being and perceived safety and fundamental environmental factors such as structure, freedom, and support. Path analysis showed that a strong perception of structure defined as the clear rules, routines, and predictability of the prison environment is a fundamental factor that influences other perceptions such as privacy, support, and social relationships. The findings also indicate that there is no direct relationship between activity level and well-being, but rather that the quality of rehabilitation activities may be more critical. In conclusion, the study supports the need for a holistic rehabilitation approach in prisons. This approach should carefully balance freedom of movement and structured programs with the individual privacy and social space needs of juvenile detainees.",
