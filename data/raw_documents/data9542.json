  "title": "Activated oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L pathway promotes endothelial pyroptosis and impairs diabetic wound healing via thioredoxin-interacting protein m",
  "abstract": "In diabetic skin, even in the absence of infection, the antiviral enzymes 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) demonstrate abnormally heightened activity. This dysregulation triggers a state of cellular stress, which not only suppresses intracellular protein synthesis but also activates innate immune responses-particularly upon pathogenic bacterial invasion. Whether the sustained activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway in diabetic skin tissue critically contributes to impaired wound healing remains to be determined. We have investigated the pyroptosis changes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) under high glucose by RNase L small interfering RNA (siRNA) to down-regulate RNase L expression. Under high glucose conditions, we observed abnormal activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway in HUVECs, which further exacerbated cellular pyroptosis upon LPS stimulation. Abnormally activated RNase L, which reduces the expression of methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), led to decreased m",
