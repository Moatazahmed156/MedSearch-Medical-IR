    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC), a frequent malignant tumor that affects women, is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in this group of individuals. For the treatment of ovarian cancer, systemic chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs or taxanes is the first-line option. However, drug resistance developed over time during chemotherapy medications worsens the situation. Since uncertainty exists for the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer, there is a need to investigate and overcome this problem. miRNAs are engaged in various signaling pathways that contribute to the chemotherapeutic resistance of ovarian cancer. In the current study, we have tried to shed light on the mechanisms by which microRNAs contribute to the drug resistance of ovarian cancer and the use of some microRNAs to combat this chemoresistance, leading to the worse outcome of ovarian cancer patients treated with systemic chemotherapeutics.",
