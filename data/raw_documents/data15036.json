  "abstract": "Solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), arises most often in cirrhotic livers, where immune exclusion and metabolic reprogramming drive extracellular acidosis (the \"Warburg effect\") and create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This study applied a non-invasive MR Spectroscopic Imaging method called Biosensor Imaging of Redundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS) to quantify extracellular pH (pH",
