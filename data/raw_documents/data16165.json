  "title": "Remote and Hybrid Work in Crime Victim Services: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "Remote and hybrid options for crime victim services grew slowly during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, followed by rapid expansion on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there has been significant focus on remote work in other sectors such as healthcare and tech industries, there have been no scoping reviews on remote service delivery in crime victim services. Using the PRISMA-ScR framework for scoping reviews, we identified 27 studies on remote or hybrid services in victim service agencies that met our inclusion criteria (empirical studies on remote and/or hybrid work in community- and/or systems-based victim service agencies, written in English). Studies were examined regarding the (a) methods and data used in empirical studies; (b) provider-level and client-level challenges and benefits; and (c) recommendations. Findings show that most studies were exploratory or descriptive in nature, collected qualitative data from service providers, and were conducted, at least in part, to learn about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Common provider-level challenges included technological barriers, concerns about the security of online services, and the development of rapport with clients virtually, while strengths included personal-professional flexibility, new collaborations, and work productivity/efficiency. Client-level challenges included technology access, digital literacy, and confidentiality and safety concerns, while strengths included increased access to services, reduced cost, and increased anonymity of online services. Results suggest that we need additional, rigorous evaluation research to understand how processes and outcomes differ between remote and in-person services for crime victims and victim service providers.",
