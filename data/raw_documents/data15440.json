  "title": "\"I Just Don't Know Enough:\" A Needs Assessment for Artificial Intelligence Adoption in Continuing Professional Development.",
  "abstract": "Rapid advances in, and availability of, generative artificial intelligence (AI) led to great interest in opportunities to create workplace efficiencies and augment health professions education. The purpose of this project was to identify the existing needs among continuing professional development (CPD) professionals and the organizational approaches necessary to support AI tool adoption. During nine focus groups and two interviews conducted between April and July 2024, participants responded to questions focused on their knowledge of, and experiences using, AI tools. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was used to identify participants' experiences with technology and organizational barriers to implementation. Data revealed barriers to adoption at the individual, team, and organizational levels: (1) knowledge of organizationally licensed tools, (2) digital literacies, (3) organizational policy and communication, (4) role expectations and task clarification, and (5) defined organizational purposes. Although current literature supports the need to develop skills for a future with AI, nuanced roles and contexts for its use had not yet been explored, creating a gap in how we consider AI in CPD. This study revealed the importance of understanding how varied technologies referred to as AI work, and the legal, ethical, and pedagogical evidence required to evaluate tools within a broader digital literacy framework. This study also informs our understanding of the organizational systems, processes, communication plans, incentives, and consequences that hinder or support technology adoption.",
