  "abstract": "Non-invasive assessment of improvement in fibrotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an important clinical problem. We aimed to develop and validate the fibrotic MASH resolution We collected data from 2,017 individuals who had two liver biopsies, separated in time, across 40 centers in the first dataset. This dataset included two independent cohorts, which were used to develop and externally validate the tool (including the baseline and change in acFibroMASH index plus change in serum alanine aminotransferase levels). The second independent dataset, comprising 17,949 patients who underwent vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) at 16 centers, was used to examine associations between the developed index and the risk of incident LREs. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 252 and 8,752 patients were included in the first and second datasets, respectively.
