    "abstract": "This short article is dedicated to the 90th Anniversary of the School of Life Sciences at Zhejiang University, China. Immunotherapy of cancer is currently a hot topic in the biomedical field, and a re-search focus of my laboratory is on developing new and effective combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies for liver cancer. Of note, my interest in immunotherapy of cancer stems from the training as an undergraduate student at Hangzhou University, China, almost 40 years ago.",
