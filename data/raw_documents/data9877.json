  "title": "[Research progress on animal models relevant to porto-sinusoidal vascular disease].",
  "abstract": "In recent years, the European Society for Vascular Surgery has proposed the concept of porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) based on idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH), thereby expanding the scope of these disease conditions and creating understanding for their natural history. However, research on the pathogenesis of this disease has progressed slowly due to the lack of corresponding animal models. A review of previous animal models that meet the definition of porto-sinusoidal vascular disease reveals that none of these models have progressed to develop cirrhosis. Nine models exhibited elevated portal vein pressure, while sixteen models showed histological manifestations related to portal hypertension. This summary aims to lay the foundation for future research. 近年来，在特发性非肝硬化性门静脉高压的基础上，欧洲肝脏血管病研究小组提出了门静脉-肝窦血管性疾病的概念，进一步拓宽了该疾病的范围，也为认识该疾病的自然史创造了条件，但由于缺乏相应的动物模型，使得对该疾病的发病机制研究进展缓慢。收集以往符合门静脉-肝窦血管性疾病定义的动物模型，均无肝硬化产生，其中9种出现门静脉压力升高、16种出现门静脉高压相关组织学表现，现进行总结以期为今后的研究奠定基础。.",
