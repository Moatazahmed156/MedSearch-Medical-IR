  "title": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their prognostic role in colorectal cancer: review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a component of the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor behavior and progression. This meta-analysis aims to describe the prognostic value of CAF biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC). A systematic search of the existing literature was performed in Medline and Embase on CAF immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers and their association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The selection of studies was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome criteria. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 3,535 records were identified, of which 84 were selected for the qualitative review and 59 ( Several CAF IHC biomarkers, particularly CD163, MMP-9, periostin, and vimentin, significantly associated with prognosis in CRC, could be proposed as surrogates for the phenotypical characterization of the tumor microenvironment.",
