    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a complex condition characterized by elevated blood pressure and organ damage involving kidneys or liver, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the fetus. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress, often caused by mitochondrial dysfunction within fetal trophoblast cells may play a major role in the development and progression of preeclampsia. Oxidative stress occurs as a result of an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the capacity of antioxidant defenses, which can lead to placental cellular damage and endothelial cell dysfunction. Targeting oxidative stress appears to be a promising therapeutic approach that has the potential to improve both short- and long-term maternal and fetal outcomes, thus reducing the global burden of preeclampsia. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive account of the mechanisms of oxidative stress in preeclampsia. Furthermore, it also examines potential interventions for reducing oxidative stress in preeclampsia, including natural antioxidant supplements, lifestyle modifications, mitochondrial targeting antioxidants, and pharmacological agents.A better understanding of the mechanism of action of proposed therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress is essential for the identification of companion biomarkers and personalized medicine approaches for the development of effective treatments of preeclampsia.",
