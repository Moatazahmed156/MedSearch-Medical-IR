    "abstract": "Herpes zoster is an infection caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus presenting as multiple grouped vesicular eruptions in a dermatomal pattern with associated pain. Recurrent herpes zoster is an uncommon event in an immunocompetent host. Here, we report a case of a young male presenting with herpes zoster over the T9 and T10 dermatome with the previous scarring of herpes zoster over the T6 dermatome over the right upper trunk. The patient improved on treatment with oral acyclovir and analgesics. In any patient with recurrenrt hepes zoster, work-up should be done to rule out immunosuppresion.",
