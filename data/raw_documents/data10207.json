  "abstract": "Elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease but its role in bleeding after cardiac surgery is unclear. We evaluated whether preoperative RDW predicts bleeding after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This was nationwide retrospective study of patients undergoing isolated CABG in Iceland, 2003-2019. RDW was analyzed continuously (per 1% increase) and dichotomized (>14.0% vs ≤ 14.0%). Primary bleeding outcomes included transfusion >4 red blood cell units, re-exploration for bleeding, and chest tube output >1000 mL/24h. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, operative urgency, cardiopulmonary bypass, and perioperative factors. The study included 1,929 patients. Elevated RDW was associated with older age, anemia, comorbidities, and urgent procedures. After adjustment, higher RDW predicted transfusion >4 RBC units (OR 1.25 per 1%, OR 1.72 for >14.0%), re-exploration (OR 1.30 per 1%, OR 2.39 for >14.0%), and chest tube output >1000 mL/24h (OR 1.13 per 1%, OR 1.34 for >14.0%). RDW was also associated with greater platelet/plasma use, longer ICU stay, and major complications, but not to 30-day mortality (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.55-2.52). Elevated RDW was independently associated with multiple bleeding complications after CABG. RDW may serve as a simple, inexpensive biomarker to improve preoperative bleeding risk stratification in CABG patients.",
