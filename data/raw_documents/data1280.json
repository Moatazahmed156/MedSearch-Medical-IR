    "abstract": "Obesity is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation. It also influences the natural history of the disease, leading to more persistent forms and poorer ablation outcomes. This article reviews atrial fibrillation ablation in the obese population, focusing on outcomes, complications and periprocedural management. Through an analysis of the possible pathophysiological mechanism linking obesity and atrial fibrillation, we identify potential strategies to improve post-ablation outcomes in this challenging population.",
