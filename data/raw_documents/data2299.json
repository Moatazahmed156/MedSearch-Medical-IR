    "abstract": "There is a clear need of dietary recommendations or guidelines at both population and/or individual levels, to prevent the Alzheimer's disease or reduce its symptoms. Though data from cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease indicate that dietary lipids ameliorate cognitive deficits or neuropathology associated with this disease. However, the data from the present dietary studies are not standardized. Most dietary research in Alzheimer's disease has not examined and compared the differential effects of each fatty acid with other dietary nutrients. Nutrients, particularly different types of fatty acids, absorb, metabolize, and interact with other lipid or nutrients differently in animals and humans with compromised neurological status. Studies in animals and tissue culture should consider such limitations to predict a better response in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The present commentary emphasizes the significance of examining composite lipids/nutrients rather than single fatty acid or nutrient. This report also provides a brief overview of the key factors need to be considered while planning in-vitro, in-vivo or clinical experiments on the effects of dietary fatty acids on Alzheimer's disease. It is to hope that keeping these considerations in mind more judicious use of dietary regimens will speed up the progress of dietary research into the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",
