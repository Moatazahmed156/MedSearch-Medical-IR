    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to describe the results and complications of primary site salvage surgery after head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with bioradiotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a retrospective chart review of 268 patients treated with bioradiotherapy between March 2006 and December 2013 at the Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge-ICO.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-nine patients developed local recurrence or had residual disease with a 1-year and 3-year overall survival of 47% and 15.4%, respectively. Salvage surgery was feasible in 22 patients (37.3%). There were 16 complications in these 22 patients (72.7%), 11 (50%) of which were major. Bilateral neck dissection was identified as a risk factor for complications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Salvage surgery after bioradiotherapy is associated with a high rate of complications. Neck dissection seems to be related to an increased rate of complications with no survival improvement. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 116-121, 2017.",
