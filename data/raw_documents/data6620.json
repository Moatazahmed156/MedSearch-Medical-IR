    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder with a prevalence of up to 2.9% in the general population. Its mechanism involves a particular electrophysiological profile as well as structural and biohumoral changes that are often irreversible. With the recent advances in pharmacology, amiodarone remains the cornerstone for the treatment of AF. Although it is one of the most controversial anti-arrhythmic agents due to the multitude of side effects, it is further recognised as the most effective drug available for the conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm in the case of significant left ventricular dysfunction or severe aortic stenosis. This quality is provided by its multivalent profile, with a complex electrophysiological activity overlapped with an anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effect. This review aims to outline the main structural and functional changes in AF and the multisite impact of amiodarone on its treatment.",
