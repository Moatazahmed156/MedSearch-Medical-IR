    "abstract": "The issue of drug resistance of Helicobacter pylori is becoming increasingly serious. To analyze the correlation between the cagA and vacA genotypes of H. pylori strains and their resistance to metronidazole, levofloxacin, and clarithromycin in patients in Xi'an, we studied 117 H. pylori strains isolated from patients in Xi'an. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori was performed. The cagA and vacA genotypes were investigated using PCR. Among 117 strains of H. pylori, the rate of detection of cagA was 91.45% (107/117), among which the detection rate of East Asian-type cagA was 85.05% (91/107) and that of Western-type cagA was 14.95% (16/107). There were only two genotypes of vacA: s1m1 and s1m2. The detection rate of vacAs1m1 was 47.01% (55/117) and that of vacAs1m2 was 52.99% (62/117). The dominant strains in Xi'an were cagA + vacAs1m2 strains. The metronidazole resistance rate of vacAs1m2 H. pylori strains was significantly higher than that of vacAs1m1 H. pylori strains (91.94% vs. 69.09%, P = 0.002). The levofloxacin resistance rate of Western-type cagA strains was significantly higher than that of East Asian-type cagA strains (56.25% vs. 20.88%, P = 0.004). The metronidazole resistance rate of cagA + vacAs1m2 H. pylori strains was significantly higher than that of cagA + vacAs1m1 H. pylori strains (91.23% vs. 66.00%, P = 0.001). Our results showed that Western-type cagA strains were more likely to develop levofloxacin resistance than East Asian-type cagA strains. VacAs1m2 strains were more prone to metronidazole resistance than vacAs1m1 strains.",
