  "title": "Microvascular hypoxia and inflammation in chronic pain syndromes.",
  "abstract": "In this opinion, we propose that compromised microvascular perfusion and inflammation are fundamental drivers of chronic pain syndromes, with many of these conditions sharing a common etiology involving suboptimal blood flow and inflammatory cascades. This hypothesis links capillary constriction, hypoxia, inflammation, and nociceptor activation into a unified framework for understanding pain mechanisms. For each example syndrome, we explore specific nuances, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic opportunities, focusing on the interplay between hypoxia and inflammation. Current treatments often emphasize anti-angiogenic or broad-spectrum approaches, which may neglect the microvascular and hypoxic origins. We review studies investigating microvascular hypoperfusion and inflammation in pain and suggest that targeted therapies addressing vascular deficits and inflammatory responses could better disrupt the hypoxia-inflammation cycle, offering novel avenues for treatment.",
