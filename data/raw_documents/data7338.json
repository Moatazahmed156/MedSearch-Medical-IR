    "abstract": "A multilayered epithelium to fulfil its function must be replaced throughout the lifespan. This is possible due to the presence of multipotent, self-renewing epidermal stem cells that give rise to differentiated cell lineages: keratinocytes, hairs, as well as sebocytes. Till now the molecular mechanisms responsible for stem cell quiescent, proliferation, and differentiation have not been fully established. It is suggested that epidermal stem cells might change their fate, both due to intrinsic events and as a result of niche-dependent extrinsic signals; however other yet unknown factors may also be involved in this process. Given the increasing excitement evoked by self-renewing epidermal stem cells, as one of the sources of adult stem cells, it seems important to reveal the mechanisms that govern their fate. In this chapter, we describe recent advances in the characterisation of the epidermal stem cells and their compartments. Furthermore, we focus on the interplay between epidermal stem cells and extrinsic signals and their role in quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation of appropriate epidermal stem cell lineages.",
