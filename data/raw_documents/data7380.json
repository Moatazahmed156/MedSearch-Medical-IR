    "abstract": "The injured spinal cord is difficult to repair and regenerate. Traditional treatments are not effective. Stem cells are a type of cells that have the potential to differentiate into various cells, including neurons. They exert a therapeutic effect by safely and effectively differentiating into neurons or replacing damaged cells, secreting neurotrophic factors, and inhibiting the inflammatory response. Many types of stem cells have been used for transplantation, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury, and the types of stem cells commonly used in experiments, to provide a reference for basic and clinical research on stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury.",
