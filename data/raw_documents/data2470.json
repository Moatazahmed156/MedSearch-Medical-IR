    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in women and is projected to surpass ovarian cancer as the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the United States in 2024. Additionally, rates of advanced and high-risk uterine cancer have been on the rise in the United States, demonstrating a need for innovation in treatment options. There have been multiple recent trials investigating the incorporation of novel agents in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      This article will discuss the current landscape of the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer, focusing on recent phase III trials published or presented on with the incorporation of immunotherapy and other novel therapeutics while also reviewing promising phase I and II trials in the field. Clinical trials were identified via clinicaltrials.gov and a PubMed literature search was performed (initially February 2024, updated May 2024).\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      The treatment field is promising for patients as many of these trials appear to offer progression free and overall survival benefits in a disease with a historically poor prognosis. Molecular profiling of endometrial cancer will be the backbone of treatment paradigms in the future.",
