    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      The present review highlights the year's most important developments in the risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Recent research has helped define the prognostic importance of incorporating tertiary Gleason 5 pattern into the Gleason sum as well as interpretation of prostate-specific antigen levels when patients are being treated with low doses of finasteride. More data have emerged on the benefits of active treatment in elderly men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. Particular subgroups of high-risk postprostatectomy patients (low postsurgical prostate-specific antigen level, positive surgical margins) may benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. For salvage radiotherapy, the first comprehensive nomogram has been developed. Further data is emerging on the cardiovascular risks associated with androgen deprivation therapy even when administered for shorter treatment durations in conjunction with definitive local therapy. In addition, androgen deprivation therapy may be associated with earlier incidence of fatal cardiovascular events. For advanced prostate cancer, the first prospective trial defining taxane-resistant prostate cancer is described.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      The data of the present year have important implications in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer by urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.",
