    "abstract": "Macrophage infiltrations (inflammation) are associated with prostate disorders such as prostatitis, prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. All prostate disorders have elevated cell proliferation, and are initiated from normal prostate epithelial cells. To date, the mechanism of how macrophages regulate normal prostate epithelial cell proliferation remains largely unknown. Using a 3D co-culture system, we here show that Raw 264.7 macrophages increased cell proliferation of normal prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells. In addition, these Raw 264.7 macrophages expressed higher levels of Ym1 and CD206. We further identify macrophage-secreted cytokines including CCL3, IL-1ra, osteopontin, M-CSF1 and GDNF as mediators for potentiating PZ-HPV-7 cell proliferation in 3D. All these cytokines differentially activated ERK and Akt. Blockade of both kinases through their inhibitors hindered macrophage-induced cell proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 cells. Hence, our data provide mechanistic insight of how inflammation may contribute to development of prostatic diseases at a very early stage through augment of cell proliferation of normal prostate epithelial cells.",
