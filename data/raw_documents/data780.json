    "abstract": "This research examines the influence that emotional distress, socially demanding contexts, and the coronavirus pandemic have had on the mental health of young adults. It highlights how active engagement in one's mental health can help mitigate the negative influence of emotional distress on mental health. A research model outlines the importance of mental health engagement in combating and controlling mental health symptoms. Implications from findings underscore the significance of creating a culture that assigns parity to both mental and physical healthcare. Direction is offered for healthcare providers in fostering mental health engagement by promoting mental health literacy and increasing access.",
