    "abstract": "Low back pain is a common problem among working adults in the United States. Occupational risk factors for low back pain include forceful lifting, bending and twisting of the trunk, whole body vibration and heavy manual labor. The initial assessment of the patient with low back pain requires obtaining an occupational history to identify risk factors in the workplace in addition to the usual inquiries and physical assessment. For those with uncomplicated low back pain, minimal use of medical tests and rapid return to limited activity are indicated. Long-term prevention of low back pain requires modification of occupational or other risk factors.",
