    "abstract": "Following the discovery of COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, different studies have been carried out to recognize the stages of the disease and the methods of achieving correct diagnosis. Investigations of cases and their contacts have revealed different degrees in the symptomatology of the disease, with asymptomatic patients gaining relevance because of the controversy regarding their role in the spread of the disease. Recognition and assessment of asymptomatic patients is essential to carry out containment actions such as public health measures for affected patients and contacts. In this review, we assess the diagnostic aspects of asymptomatic patients according to the available evidence of people with COVID-19.",
