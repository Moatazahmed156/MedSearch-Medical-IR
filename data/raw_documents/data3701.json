    "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is steadily escalating throughout the world in people from a wide range of ethnic groups and all social and economic levels. Type 2 diabetes is no longer a disease only of adults: parallel with the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes in adults, an 'emerging epidemic' of type 2 diabetes has been observed in youth over the last decade. Research and clinical experience in adults have established that insulin resistance is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, insulin resistance alone is not sufficient to cause diabetes, which will develop only when insulin secretion by the beta-cells fails. This review discusses the recent emergence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, its risk factors, pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment modalities.",
