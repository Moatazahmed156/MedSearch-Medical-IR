    "abstract": "Anxiety on college campuses has increased due to the COVID-19 epidemic's profound effects on society. Much research has been conducted on how the built environment influences mental health; however, little has been undertaken on how it affects student mental health in the context of the epidemic from the architectural scale perspective of academic buildings. Based on online survey data, this study develops multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression models to investigate students' satisfaction ratings of the academic buildings' physical environments during the epidemic and how these satisfaction ratings affect students' anxiety tendencies. According to the study's findings regarding the natural exposure perspective, students who perceived the academic building's poor semi-open space view (p = 0.004, OR = 3.22) as unsatisfactory factors were more likely to show anxiety tendencies. In terms of the physical conditions, students who were dissatisfied with the noise level in the classroom (p = 0.038, OR = 0.616) and the summer heat in semi-open spaces (p = 0.031, OR = 2.38) were more likely to exhibit anxiety tendencies. Additionally, even after controlling for confusing distractions, the general satisfaction rating of the academic building's physical environments (p = 0.047, OR = 0.572) was still able to significantly and negatively affect students' anxiety tendencies. The study's findings can be used in the architectural and environmental planning of academic buildings focusing on mental health.",
