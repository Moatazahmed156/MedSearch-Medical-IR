  "abstract": "The association between blood pressure (BP) and the mortality risk may vary depending on the comorbidities. This study was conducted to investigate the subgroup-specific correlation between systolic BP (SBP) and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The Clinical Deep Data Accumulation System for PCI (CLIDAS-PCI), a nation-wide multicenter database with seven tertiary medical hospitals in Japan, retrospectively collected data on patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease. Cubic spline curves modeled the relationship between SBP and all-cause death in the entire cohort and subgroups stratified by age, sex, diabetes, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, renal function and LV systolic function. We assessed the SBP, which minimizes mortality risk. A total of 8384 patients [71 [IQR 64, 78] years, 6494 (77%) male] with SBP at hospital discharge were analyzed. During 2.7 years of median follow-up, 695 deaths occurred. In the overall population, spline analysis demonstrated a nadir range of mortality risk around an SBP of 110-130 mmHg. Subgroup analyses revealed that elderly (age ≥ 80 years), those with renal dysfunction, and those with preserved LV systolic function had higher SBP levels associated with lowest risk. Conversely, patients <80 years, those with better renal function, and those with LV systolic dysfunction exhibited lower SBP levels at lowest risk. This study demonstrated differential association between SBP and mortality risk in various subgroups, highlighting the need for personalized BP management in multimorbid patients with coronary artery disease.",
