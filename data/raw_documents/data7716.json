    "abstract": "As the U.S. population's demographics shift, young U.S. adults are increasingly engaged in informal caregiving for aging generations. Yet, there is little research on the unique experiences and needs of young adults who take on caregiving roles for adult cancer patients. Herein we demonstrate through a theoretical description that young adult cancer care partners deserve distinct recognition in the cancer control continuum given the psychological, physical, financial, and social features unique to their cancer experience.",
