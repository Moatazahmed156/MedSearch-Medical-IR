    "abstract": "This article reviews the management of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury in children, focusing on acute care, imaging, and rehabilitation strategies to mitigate secondary injury and maximize recovery. Key approaches include using optimal imaging modalities, managing intracranial pressure, and employing targeted rehabilitation. Biomarkers and novel therapies are under investigation, while postacute support emphasizes cognitive, physical, and psychosocial rehabilitation to enhance long-term quality of life.",
