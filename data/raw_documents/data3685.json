    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric population is now a public health problem. It represents 8 to 45% of all diabetes reported among children and adolescents. Concurrently, childhood obesity has become an epidemic in the United States. Epidemiologic risk factors and diagnostic criteria have largely been established: The incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age and obesity. Children and adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes usually have a first- or second-degree relative with the disorder. Familial clustering and twin studies have suggested a genetic component for type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote diabetes in susceptible individuals, the best treatment plans, and methods of prevention of this disorder are not yet established.",
