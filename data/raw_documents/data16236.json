  "abstract": "The human respiratory virome is an underexplored component of the microbiome that includes diverse DNA and RNA viruses such as eukaryotic viruses, bacteriophages, and archaeal viruses. Recent advances in metagenomics have revealed the complexity and dynamic nature of the human respiratory virome, which interacts closely with the host and the bacterial microbiome to influence respiratory health and disease. In healthy individuals, the virome is characterized by low biomass and high temporal variability, with ",
