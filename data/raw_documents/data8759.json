    "abstract": "Gene therapy emerged as an important area of research and led to the success of multiple product approvals in the clinic. The number of clinical trials for this class of therapeutics is expected to grow over the next decade. Gene therapy products are complex and heterogeneous, employ different types of vectors and are susceptible to degradation. The product development process for commercially viable gene-based pharmaceuticals remains challenging. In this review, challenges, stability, and drug product formulation development strategies using viral or non-viral vectors, as well as accelerated regulatory approval pathways for gene therapy products are discussed.",
