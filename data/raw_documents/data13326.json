  "title": "[Progresses on temporal interference electromagnetic stimulation for non-invasive deep brain function modulation].",
  "abstract": "This article presents a systematic review of the research progress on temporal interference (TI) electromagnetic stimulation for deep brain function modulation. It first analyzes the fundamental principle of generating low-frequency envelopes through the interference of dual-frequency electric or magnetic fields. Combined with simulation studies, this analysis reveals that TI offers superior focal specificity in deep brain regions compared with traditional transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation. The reviewed studies indicate that multi-electrode or multi-coil configurations can substantially enhance the focality and penetration of electric fields in deep brain areas. In clinical applications, TI has shown potential advantages in improving motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, enhancing working memory, and localizing epileptic foci, though careful evaluation on TI's safety and ethical considerations remains essential. Finally, this review highlights that integrating artificial intelligence-based parameter optimization with personalized brain network modeling represents a key pathway toward overcoming current technical limitations, hoping to lay a theoretical foundation for developing closed-loop precise neuromodulation systems. 本文系统综述时间干涉（TI）电磁刺激在深部脑功能调控中的研究进展，首先通过分析双频电/磁场干涉产生低频包络的基本原理，并结合仿真研究结果，揭示该技术相较于传统经颅电/磁刺激具有更优的深部聚焦特性。研究汇总表明，多电极/线圈配置能够显著提升电场在深部脑区的聚焦性和穿透性。在临床应用方面，TI在帕金森病运动症状改善、工作记忆增强及癫痫定位中展现出潜在优势，但需谨慎对待TI的安全性评估以及相关伦理审查。最后，本文提出融合人工智能参数优化与个性化脑网络建模是突破当前技术瓶颈的关键路径，期望通过本文综述为开发闭环式精准神经调控系统奠定理论基础。.",
