    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed based on the 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria whereby rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody are the serological markers included in these criteria. Anti-RA33 antibody has the potential to provide additional diagnostic value in rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic performance of anti-RA33 antibody as a serological marker for rheumatoid arthritis.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirtyfour patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 34 non-rheumatoid arthritis individuals were included in this cross-sectional study. Anti-RA33 antibody and rheumatoid factor were performed on all samples.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for anti-RA33 antibody and rheumatoid factor were 41.1%, 97.1%, 93.3%, 62.3% and 64.7%, 79.4%, 75.9%, 69.2% respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity if either anti-RA33 antibody or rheumatoid factor are positive were 79.4% and 76.47% respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Anti-RA33 antibody showed good specificity and positive predictive value and could be considered as a potential serological marker for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis.",
