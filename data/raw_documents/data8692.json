    "abstract": "We detected yellow fever virus in Haemagogus mosquitoes collected in 2022 in an Amazon rainforest bordering Manaus, Brazil. The viral genome sequence occupied a basal position within the South American I genotype 1E lineage. Our findings reinforce the Amazon Basin as a source for yellow fever virus re-emergence.",
