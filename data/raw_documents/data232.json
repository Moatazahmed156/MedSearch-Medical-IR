    "abstract": "Mentalization-how people understand their own minds and those of others-is an attachment-based, normative, cognitive, and affective capacity important to interpersonal relations and to certain kinds of psychotherapy. Mentalization seems related to aspects of, and may hold important implications for, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Weissman and colleagues' IPT manual does not explicitly describe improvement in mentalization as a targeted outcome of therapy, but IPT may utilize mentalization as an underlying process. Recent theory emphasizes the applicability of a mentalization model to many, if not all, types of psychotherapy and suggests particular value for affect-focused and socially focused psychotherapies such as IPT, despite IPT's differences in focus and diagnostic targets from mentalization-based treatments. This article reviews the overlap of these approaches and suggests the potential of mentalization to mediate IPT outcomes.",
