  "title": "18-yr cumulative incidence of respiratory outcomes is related to employment sectors in a general population sample.",
  "abstract": "Job-related exposures play a significant, often disregarded, role in respiratory outcome development. Evaluating how this exposure impacts the incidence of respiratory illnesses in the general population is crucial for prevention and occupational health surveillance. A total of 823 workers/ex-workers from ​​Pisa (Italy) participated in 2 surveys over 18 years (PI2 1991-93, PI3 2009-11). Health status, occupational sector, and individual risk factors were assessed through a questionnaire; airway obstruction (AO) by spirometry. Exposure was defined as working for at least 3 months in a sector at risk for respiratory diseases at PI2. Cumulative incidence was calculated as \"incident cases/population at risk\". The relationship between outcome incidence and occupational exposure was assessed through multiple logistic regressions adjusted for baseline (PI2) risk factors. Analysis of covariance estimated the effect of occupational exposure on changes in FEV",
