    "abstract": "There is a rising interest in studying the possible therapeutic value of fat-soluble micronutrients like vitamin K2 for preventing or controlling type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to evaluate levels of vitamin K2 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study enrolled 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 30 individuals as a control group. Blood samples were collected from each participant for estimation of vitamin K2 by (ELISA), HbA1c by (Cobas), lipid profile by (colourimetric methods) and calculated BMI. The mean±Standard Deviation (SD) of vitamin K2 levels for the type 2 diabetes group were (185.13±30.08) pg/ml, with a highly significant decrease (p<0.001) when compared with the control group (303.91±58.60) pg/ml. The HbA1c, cholesterol, TG, and LDL-C level for the type 2 diabetes group highly significant increase (p<0.001) when compared with the control while HDL-C decreased when compared with the control group. The current study concluded that: Vitamin K2 levels showed a highly significant decrease in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared with those in the control group. Vitamin K2 levels play an important role in improving glycated haemoglobin and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
