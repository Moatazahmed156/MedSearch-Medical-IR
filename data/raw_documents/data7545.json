    "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      To identify and synthesize qualitative evaluation methods used in nursing interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A systematic qualitative review with a content analysis. Four databases were used: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL using pre-defined terms. The included papers were published from 2014-2018.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We followed the guidelines of Dixon-Woods et al., Sandelowski and Barroso, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist and The Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research Approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 103 papers, 15 were eligible for inclusion. The main theme Challenging complexity by evaluating qualitatively described processes and characteristics of qualitative evaluation. Two analytic themes emerged: Evaluating the implementation process and Evaluating improvements brought about by the programme.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Different qualitative evaluation methods in nursing are a way of documenting knowledge that is difficult to illuminate in natural settings and make an important contribution when determining the pros and cons of an intervention.",
