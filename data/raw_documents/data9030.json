    "abstract": "This chapter reviews the discoveries and initial characterizations (1930-1990) of three plant rhabdoviruses, sonchus yellow net virus, potato yellow dwarf virus, and lettuce necrotic yellows virus, that have become model systems for research on this group of enveloped negative-strand RNA plant viruses. We have used our personal perspectives to review the early historical studies of these viruses, the important technologies and tools, such as density gradient centrifugation, that were developed during the research, and to highlight the eminent scientists involved in these discoveries. Early studies on sites of virus replication, virion structure, physicochemical composition, and the use of protoplasts and vector insect cell culture for virus research are discussed, and differences between the nuclear and cytoplasmic lifestyles of plant rhabdoviruses are contrasted. Finally, we briefly summarize the genome organization and more recent developments culminating in the development of a reverse genetics system for plant negative-strand RNA viruses.",
