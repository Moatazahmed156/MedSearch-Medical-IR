    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is common, and recent efforts in clinical management have focused on identifying patients who could be candidates from less aggressive management or who could benefit from more aggressive therapy. As prostate cancer histology, especially Gleason score, plays a critical role in predicting patient outcomes, attempts have been made to refine histologic classification and reporting in prostate cancer to facilitate patient risk stratification. This review discusses recent updates in prostate cancer grading and reporting.",
