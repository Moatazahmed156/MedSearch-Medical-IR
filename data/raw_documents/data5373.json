    "abstract": "Gonadotoxic treatments like chemotherapy or radiotherapy and ovarian surgery may result in an accelerated depletion of the ovarian reserve and subsequent premature ovarian insufficiency. Important determinants of this severe risk that require fertility preservation strategies are patient age, ovarian reserve, type of treatment, and administered dose. Oocytes and ovarian tissue can both be cryopreserved, with encouraging results in terms of pregnancy and live birth rates according to recent publications. Moreover, since ovarian tissue transplantation also results in long-term endocrine resumption, it represents a potential future therapeutic option for complete ovarian function restoration in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency.",
