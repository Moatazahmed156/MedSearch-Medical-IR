  "title": "Long COVID: What is it? Who has it? What Are Treatment Resources in Missouri?",
  "abstract": "As we pass the five-year mark since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the prevalence of persistent (and often disabling) symptoms from the SARS-CoV-2 virus is estimated to be on par with the prevalence of heart disease. Yet, these Long COVID symptoms can masquerade as other conditions and/or normal aging, so it is believed that Long COVID is under-diagnosed and, as a result, under-treated. Although there is not yet a true cure for Long COVID, many patients benefit substantially from rehabilitation strategies, medications, and social support resources that are available in Missouri. The purpose of this article is to review the definition and epidemiology of Long COVID, provide practical guidance for Long COVID assessment and management especially in the primary care setting, and increase awareness of regional resources for people in Missouri who are living with Long COVID and for the clinicians who are caring for them.",
  "disease": "pneumonia"
