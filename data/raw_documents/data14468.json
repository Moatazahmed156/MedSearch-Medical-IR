  "abstract": "Spontaneous tendon rupture occurs in a concerning number of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however almost no data exist regarding CKD-related tendon pathology. Given that tendon ruptures have a significant impact on health and well-being we sought to determine whether tendon mechanics are altered by kidney disease in an established rat model of CKD. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (age = 8 weeks) were equally divided into a control group (CON, n = 16) and a group fed a diet containing 0.25% adenine to induce kidney disease (",
