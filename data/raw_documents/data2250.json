    "abstract": "The number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia is growing at a staggering rate. Thus, it is essential that social workers in geriatric settings are knowledgeable about this disorder and the appropriate interventions to use at all stages of the disease. The purpose of this article is to examine the types of non-pharmacological, psychosocial treatments that are used to manage the behavioral manifestations and changes in the mood of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia. While great strides have been made in pharmacological treatments of Alzheimer's disease, less attention has been given to the types of psychosocial interventions that are readily employed in community-based and long-term care settings to assist in the care of these individuals. This article provides an overview of psychosocial interventions, as well as identifies the direction for future evidence-based treatment studies, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.",
