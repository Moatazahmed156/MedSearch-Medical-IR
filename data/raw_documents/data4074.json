    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Metastatic involvement of the penis in cases of rectal cancer is exceptionally rare condition. Our clinical case report and review of the literature will contribute in complementing currently limited data on penile metastasis from rectal cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report a case of a 64-year-old male diagnosed with penile metastasis from rectal cancer. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). However, penile metastasis developed 3 years later, clinically presenting as penile pain and solid formations along the entire length of the penis with visible tumor in the head of the penis. The amputation of penis was performed, and adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed. The patient survived only 6 months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Penile metastasis from rectal cancer in most cases is a lethal pathology that indicates wide dissemination of oncological disease and has a very poor prognosis. Aggressive surgical treatment is doubtful in metastatic disease as this will negatively affect the quality of life.",
