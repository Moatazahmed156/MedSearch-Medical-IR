  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, particularly due to the rise of multidrug-resistance and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. In addition to Mtb, many non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) strains are associated with opportunistic infections in animals and humans. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel pyrimidine derivatives as potential antimycobacterial agents. A systematic structure-activity relationship study was conducted, leading to the identification of several promising compounds. Among them, derivative 55a demonstrated the highest efficacy, exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC",
