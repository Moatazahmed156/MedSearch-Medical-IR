    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Mentalization processes seem to be of high relevance for social learning and seem important in all psychotherapies. The exact role of mentalization processes in psychotherapy is still unknown. The aim of the present systematic review is to investigate whether mentalization is related to the therapeutic outcome and, if so, whether it has a moderating, mediative, or predictive function.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review with an electronic database search was conducted. A total of 2567 records were identified, and 10 studies were included in the final synthesis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Psychotherapy research is still in an initial phase of examining and understanding the impact of mentalization on psychotherapy outcome. The small number of studies and the executed study designs and statistical analyses indicate the possible role that mentalization has in psychotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Generally, strongly elaborated study designs are needed to identify the role of mentalization in psychotherapy. Mentalization seems to be differently represented in differential treatment approaches. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the patient's mentalizing capacity seems to be relevant to the psychotherapy process. Psychotherapies should be adapted to this.",
