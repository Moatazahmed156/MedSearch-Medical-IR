    "abstract": "In type 2 diabetes mellitus there is an overproduction of chylomicron in the postprandial state that is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Current evidence points out a leading role of enterocyte in dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes mellitus, since it increases the production of apolipoprotein B-48 in response to a raise in plasma free fatty acids and glucose. The chylomicron metabolism is regulated by many factors apart from ingested fat, including hormonal and metabolic elements. More recently, studies about the role of gut hormones, have demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 decreases the production of apolipoprotein B-48 and glucagon-like peptide-2 enhances it. Insulin acutely inhibits intestinal chylomicron production in healthy humans, whereas this acute inhibitory effect on apolipoprotein B-48 production is blunted in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Understanding these emerging regulators of intestinal chylomicron secretion may offer new mechanisms of control for its metabolism and provide novel therapeutic strategies focalized in type 2 diabetes mellitus postprandial hyperlipidemia with the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk.",
