    "abstract": "The etiologies of low back pain and the biomechanics and pathology of the lumbar spine as they relate to tennis stroke mechanics have been reviewed, and a treatment protocol has been presented. A recent survey of the Men's Professional Tennis Tour is the only article found that discusses low back pain in tennis players; the orthopaedic and sports medicine literature is otherwise devoid of any relevant studies. Because this one survey indicates that 38 per cent of 143 tennis players missed at least one tournament because of low back problems, it seems obvious that an epidemiologic study on low back pain in racquet sports is vital to a more thorough understanding of the problem.",
