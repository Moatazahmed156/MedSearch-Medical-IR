    "abstract": "Detection of specific autoantibodies remains the most practical clinical and research marker of autoimmune disease. The lack of consensus on ovary specific antibodies as a marker for ovarian autoimmunity has clinical and research consequences. The objective of this review is to summarize the evidence for ovarian autoimmunity and the detection of ovary specific autoantibodies in humans. Evidence favors the presence of an autoimmune disease of the ovary. Ovarian autoantibodies are associated primarily with premature ovarian failure (POF) and unexplained infertility. Variations in detection of ovarian autoantibodies are likely to be due to study design elements such as antibody test format, antigen preparation, and criteria for study and comparison groups. In addition, multiple targets appear to be involved in ovarian autoimmunity including ovarian cellular elements and oocyte related antigens. Many studies only assess one target antigen, leaving individuals with ovarian autoimmunity unidentified. The next most significant advance in characterizing ovarian autoimmunity will be definitive identification of the specific antigens and development of standardized tests based on use of specific antigens.",
