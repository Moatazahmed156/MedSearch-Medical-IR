    "abstract": "A sudden loss of motor function in segments of the spinal cord results in immobilisation and is complicated by bone loss and fractures in areas below the level of injury. Despite the acceptance of osteoporosis and fractures as two major public health problems, in people with spinal cord injuries, the mechanisms are not adequately investigated. Multiple risk factors for bone loss and fractures are present in this disabled population. This review is an update on the epidemiology and physiopathological mechanisms in spinal cord injury-related bone impairment and fractures.",
