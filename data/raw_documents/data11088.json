  "title": "The Long-Term Effects of Cost-Related Nonadherence on COPD Outcomes and Progression in the COPDGene Study Cohort.",
  "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive disease with a high prevalence and cost burden on the health care system. Overall, adherence to prescribed therapies is low and associated with worse outcomes. Cost-related nonadherence (CRN) is a type of nonadherence that could be addressed through policy. We are evaluating the long-term association of CRN on COPD outcomes in a well-profiled cohort. We identified 2,521 participants with baseline COPD and having answered the social and economic questionnaire in the COPDGene cohort. Of these, 408 participants endorsed experiencing CRN. Multivariable regression models were utilized to assess the association of experiencing CRN and COPD outcomes including functional status, health status, and progression of disease. Experiencing CRN is associated with worse functional status by 6MWD, symptom burden by CAT Score and health status by SGRQ. Longitudinal analysis reveals an association of CRN with faster lung function decline and increased risk of COPD exacerbations. Policy changes to address out-of-pocket medication costs may improve COPD outcomes and potentially lead to long-term cost savings.",
