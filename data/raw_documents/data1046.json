    "abstract": "This review summarizes the development of head and neck pathology. Over the last decades, head and neck pathology cancer science began to examine the behavior of these cancers and to uncover the causative factors that lead to head and neck cancer. The avoidance of certain discovered carcinogens, lifestyle changes and certain vaccinations can reduce the risk of these cancers. Efforts in pathology are ongoing to aid the prevention and to delay the development of head and neck cancer.",
