  "title": "Mask Usage in Healthcare Settings: Is It the Right Time for Easing Restrictions? A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, personal protective equipment, particularly face masks, has been central to infection control and reducing associated mortality. Global mask mandates, combined with widespread vaccination, helped curb peak pandemic phases. In 2023, the WHO reclassified COVID-19 as an ongoing health priority rather than an emergency, prompting reassessment of mask policies in healthcare settings. Yet, hospitals remain high-risk, especially with the concurrent \"triple epidemic\" of COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. This review summarizes current evidence on mask efficacy, adherence, and policy changes to determine whether, when, and under what conditions mask use can be safely eased in clinical settings.",
