    "abstract": "Tunicates are widely distributed worldwide and are recognized as abundant marine bioresources with many potential applications. In this review, state-of-the-art studies on chemical composition analyses of various tunicate species were summarized; these studies confirmed that tunicates contain nutrients similar to fish (such as abundant cellulose, protein, and ω-3 fatty acid (FA)-rich lipids), indicating their practical and feasible uses for food or animal feed exploration. However, the presence of certain toxic elements should be evaluated in terms of safety. Moreover, recent studies on bioactive substances extracted from tunicates (such as toxins, sphingomyelins, and tunichromes) were analyzed, and their biological properties were comprehensively reviewed, including antimicrobial, anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, some insights and prospects for the future exploration of tunicates are provided which are expected to guide their further application in the food, animal feed, and pharmaceutical industries. This review is critical to providing a new pathway for converting the common pollution issues of hydroponic nutrients into valuable marine bioresources.",
