    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer accounts for the death of over 100,000 females every year and is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) have been found to represent two distinct entities based on their molecular differences, clinical course, and response to chemotherapy. Currently, all ovarian cancers are staged according to the revised staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Imaging plays an integral role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of ovarian cancers. This review will be based on the two-tier grading system of epithelial ovarian cancers, with the main emphasis on serous ovarian cancer, and the role of imaging to characterize low-grade vs high-grade tumors and monitor disease recurrence during follow-up.",
