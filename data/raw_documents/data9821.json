  "title": "Impact of Preservative-Free Travoprost on Intraocular Pressure and Ocular Surface in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Patients.",
  "abstract": "The present study assesses the effectiveness and tolerability of preservative-free travoprost in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), focusing on intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction and ocular surface health over a six-month period. The study was prospectively designed and conducted at the University General Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece. A total of 45 patients diagnosed with either POAG or ocular hypertension (OHT) were included in the study; all were either newly diagnosed or had previously discontinued prostaglandin therapy due to intolerance. Of these, 39 participants completed the study. All subjects were administered preservative-free travoprost once daily. Clinical evaluations were conducted at baseline (T0), and at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6) and 12 months (T12) following treatment initiation. The primary outcomes encompassed reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP), Schirmer test values, tear break-up time (TBUT), conjunctival hyperemia, as well as measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness. Visual field parameters were also assessed. A significant reduction in IOP was observed at T1, T3, T6 and T12 compared to baseline ( Preservative-free travoprost effectively reduces IOP while improving ocular surface health, particularly in tear production and conjunctival hyperemia.",
