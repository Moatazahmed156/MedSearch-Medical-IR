  "title": "Attachment and replication of clade 2.3.4.4b influenza A (H5N1) viruses in human respiratory epithelium: an in-vitro study.",
  "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage pose a global threat to wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Cross-species transmission events to mammals, including humans, in the past 4 years highlight this threat. For influenza A viruses, crucial determinants of cross-species and intraspecies transmission to and among mammals include attachment to and replication in respiratory airway epithelial cells. Although these determinants have been studied for H5N1 viruses in the past, limited studies for clade 2.3.4.4b viruses exist. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the ability of recent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses to attach to human respiratory tissues, to replicate in human airway epithelial cells and the associated immune response. In this in-vitro study, we investigated three H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses (H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b viruses and H5N1 Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have phenotypic characteristics that are different from a clade 2.1.3.2 H5N1 The EU, the Dutch Research Council, the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, and the Dutch Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Nature, and Health, Welfare and Sport.",
