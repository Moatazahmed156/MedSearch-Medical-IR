  "title": "Exploring the mechanism of action of Jinqiancao granules against liver cirrhosis based on the liver-gut axis.",
  "abstract": "Current treatments for cirrhosis-a progressive disease marked by fibrosis and inflammation-are limited and non-specific. Jinqiancao granules (JQC), a traditional Chinese medicine used for hepatobiliary diseases, could provide a promising new therapeutic approach. The objective of this study is to explore the therapeutic effects and potential molecular mechanisms of JQC on CCl To investigate the therapeutic effects of JQC and its impact on the liver-gut axis, a mouse model of liver cirrhosis was established by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl JQC ameliorated CCl This study demonstrates that JQC mitigates liver cirrhosis in mice by modulating the gut-liver axis, enhancing the intestinal barrier, and inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These results propose JQC as a promising therapeutic candidate, warranting further clinical translation.",
