    "abstract": "During the past decade, treatment strategies for patients with advanced prostate cancer involving stage IV (T4N0M0, N1M0 or M1) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and recurrent prostate cancer after treatment with curative intent, as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer, have extensively evolved with the introduction and approval of several new agents including sipuleucel-T, radium-223, abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel, all of which have shown significant improvement on overall survival. The appropriate use of these agents and the proper sequencing of these agents are still not optimized. The results of several recently reported randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies could assist in developing a treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer. In addition, prospective studies and molecular characterization of tumors to address these issues are ongoing.",
