  "title": "Prevalence of Significant Coronary Artery Stenosis and Relationship with Carotid Maximum Intima-Media Thickness in Asymptomatic Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Kidney Disease: A Single-Center, Prospective, Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Coronary artery disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the actual burden of asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis in patients with advanced-stage CKD remains unclear. We investigated the prevalence and associated factors of significant coronary artery stenosis (≥ 50%) in asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe (stage G3-5) CKD. Furthermore, we evaluated the usefulness of carotid maximum intima-media thickness (IMT) in predicting significant coronary artery stenosis in these patients. We enrolled 128 patients (men: 68.0%; mean age: 70.3±11.2 years; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate: 37.6±12.9 mL/min/1.73 m Seventy-six patients (60%) had significant coronary artery stenosis. Univariable analyses showed that age, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and carotid maximum-IMT were associated with the presence of significant coronary artery stenosis. However, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that only carotid maximum-IMT (odds ratio: 4.86;  The prevalence of significant coronary artery stenosis was high (60%) in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. Carotid maximum-IMT was the primary factor associated with the presence of significant coronary artery stenosis and might be a surrogate marker for significant coronary artery stenosis in these patients.",
