    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially under 45 years of age. The primary brain injury occurs at the moment of trauma and is defined by the direct damage to tissue. In contrast, secondary brain injury develops over time and is accessible to therapeutic interventions. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury have to be transferred to a specialized trauma centre in order to perform appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. These include surgical management of lesions (e.g. haematoma evacuation) as well as specific neurointensive care. Neurointensive care medicine principles such as treatment of increased intracranial pressure and advanced invasive neuromonitoring of brain tissue have to be followed.",
