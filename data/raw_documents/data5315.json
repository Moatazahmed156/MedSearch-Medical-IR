    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that most frequently involves the skin and the musculoskeletal system. In addition to the more common cutaneous manifestations, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) may rarely occur in association with SLE or even be the first sign of the disease. We describe a 40-year-old man with SLE-associated IGD, and review all cases of SLE-associated IGD in the literature.",
