  "title": "Blood bank trends in Kuwait: five-year analysis of donations and investigations.",
  "abstract": "Reliable national transfusion services require continuous surveillance of donation activity, inventory losses, transfusion-transmissible infection (TTI) screening, and immunohematology workload. Kuwait's centralized service is coordinated by the Kuwait Central Blood Bank (KCBB). We performed a retrospective analysis of officially requested KCBB annual reports (January 2019-December 2023). Collated variables included donation volumes, donor sex and ABO/RhD distribution, discarded components, and NAT screening outcomes for HBV, HCV, and HIV. Patient-side indicators comprised total immunohematology samples, antibody screening/identification, antenatal testing, and alloantibody profiles. The analysis was descriptive, presenting distributions and temporal trends without inferential testing. Donations averaged ~82,000 annually, with a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) and recovery to ~85,000 in 2023. Male donors accounted for >85% of donations. O RhD KCBB data highlight persistent male predominance among donors, RhD-negative scarcity (8.6%), and variable component wastage, especially FFP. These findings support targeted donor-recruitment strategies, obstetric-transfusion planning for RhD-negative supply, and strengthened inventory management to improve resilience and safety of Kuwait's blood supply.",
