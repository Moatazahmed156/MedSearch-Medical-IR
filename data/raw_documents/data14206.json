  "title": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and hand osteoarthritis: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.",
  "abstract": "To explore whether biological levels of specific per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and a mixture of PFAS - reflecting the overall effect and accounting for correlations among each PFAS - relate to incident hand osteoarthritis (HOA) and progression. Among a case-cohort sample from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (n=1,878), we examined associations of 8 PFAS in serum with odds of developing over the subsequent 4 years (1) symptomatic HOA and (2) an increased number of joints with radiographic osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence≥2; yes/no). We used weighted logistic regression to assess single PFAS (continuous and quartiles) and quantile g-computation to assess the PFAS-mixture in relation to our primary outcomes. Participants were primarily female (58%) and on average 62 years of age and overweight (mean BMI=28.6 kg/m We observed possible associations of PFDA and PFNA serum concentrations with symptomatic HOA incidence, but we otherwise found no consistent evidence that greater PFAS concentrations relate to a greater chance of developing HOA incidence or progression.",
