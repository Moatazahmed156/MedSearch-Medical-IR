    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to determine and assess the perceived physical and psychosocial barriers to, and the constitution of, ideal health and wellness programming among rural firefighters.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted and recorded on 40 rural, structural firefighters. Responses to each question were qualitatively analyzed to determine themes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Several themes emerged in regards to the physical and psychosocial stressors of the profession. Three themes emerged relating to the self-perceived barriers to overall health and wellness. There was also agreement in the components of an \"ideal\" workplace health and wellness program to help overcome perceived barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The themes that emerged from the interviews with this population are similar to firefighters who work in a more urban area. This indicates that the stressors and barriers firefighters face may be occupation, and not location, driven.",
