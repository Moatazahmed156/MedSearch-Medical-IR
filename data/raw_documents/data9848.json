  "title": "Atrial Fibrillation in COVID-19: Mechanisms, Clinical Impact, and Monitoring Strategies.",
  "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed a close and multifaceted relationship between viral infection, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular health. Among the cardiac complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), atrial fibrillation (AF)-especially new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF)-has emerged as a major determinant of disease severity and prognosis. Clinical studies and meta-analyses show that 5-10% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop AF, with markedly higher rates in critically ill individuals. Both pre-existing and NOAF are independently associated with increased risks of intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, thromboembolic events, and mortality. The underlying mechanisms involve a combination of cytokine-mediated inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular injury, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Viral downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors contributes to myocardial fibrosis, while hypoxia, oxidative stress, and autonomic imbalance further promote electrical remodeling and arrhythmogenesis. Post-infectious studies indicate that atrial structural changes and autonomic dysfunction may persist for months, predisposing survivors to recurrent arrhythmias. Technological advances in telecardiology and digital medicine have provided new tools for early detection and long-term monitoring. Wearable electroencephalography (ECG) devices, implantable loop recorders (ILRs), and artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms enable continuous rhythm surveillance and individualized management, improving outcomes in post-COVID patients. This review summarizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical implications, and monitoring strategies of AF in COVID-19. It underscores the importance of integrating telemedicine and AI-assisted diagnostics into cardiovascular care to mitigate the long-term arrhythmic and systemic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
