    "abstract": "Lymph node cytology is quick, easy, and rewarding. Cytologic samples of peripheral and/or internal lymph nodes may be collected by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or nonaspiration fine-needle biopsy techniques. In addition, imprints or scrapings may be made from lymph nodes that have been surgically removed or at necropsy. Lymph node cytology is an excellent way to evaluate a lymphadenopathy whether it is a single node enlarged, multiple nodes enlarged, or a generalized lymphadenopathy. If multiple lymph nodes are enlarged, more than one should be sampled. A lymph node away from the mouth or any site of inflammation should be aspirated as well as any lymph node close to a site of inflammation. Generally, if no lymph nodes are enlarged, lymph node cytology is not helpful.",
