    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Growth charts are the most commonly used tool for evaluating the development and nutrition of children. The UAE had its first chart produced 30 years ago.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      The goal of the present study was to derive updated growth charts based on the current UAE child population. A national cross-sectional study involving children in all the seven Emirates that comprise the UAE was undertaken (UAEMCGS 2 study- the United Arab Emirates Multi-Centre Growth Study 2).\n    \n\n\n          Subjects and methods:\n        \n      \n      Anthropometric measurements (height/length and weight) were made on 20,998 children of both sexes from birth to 18 years of age. Growth charts were constructed using the LMS method and are presented.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      On comparing the 1992 and the 2021 UAE growth charts it was found that there was a significant increase in the height of Emirati children at ages 4 and 5 years in 2021.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The children's heights and weights in this study were generally larger than those of the UAE children measured in 1992, and the countries in the WHO study, but were generally smaller than those of USA children as seen from the CDC charts.",
