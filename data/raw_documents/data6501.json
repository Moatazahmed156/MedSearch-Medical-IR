    "abstract": "Few clinical studies suggest a significant influence of diet or nutritional supplementation on ulcerative colitis. One reason is that ulcerative colitis, like many chronic diseases, is multifactorial. This article will describe and review the relevant literature on ulcerative colitis, including studies of (1) diet and intravenous therapy, (2) nutritional status and nutritional supplementation, and (3) bowel flora and immune function and their influences. Also, results of a retrospective chart review study that was done at a complementary medicine office will be presented. Finally, suggestions for future research will be discussed based on a nutritional model of ulcerative colitis. Taken together, it is hoped that these areas will clarify the current status of ulcerative colitis research and promote the types of investigations that are necessary to establish the validity of nutritional influences on ulcerative colitis as well as the mechanisms that are involved.",
