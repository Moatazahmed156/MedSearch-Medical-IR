  "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection serving as a significant etiological factor in endemic regions. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the most commonly used biomarker, has limited sensitivity, particularly in AFP-negative HCC. Recent studies have identified origin recognition complex subunit 1 (ORC1) and extra spindle pole bodies-like 1 (ESPL1) as promising serum biomarkers, both linked to HBV DNA integration, a mechanism known to drive hepatocarcinogenesis. To assess serum ORC1's diagnostic value for HBV-HCC and its link to  In this case-control study, 479 HBV-infected patients were enrolled, including 20 with HBV  HBV integration near the ORC1 locus (chromosome 1p32.3) was detected in 71.4% of HBV-HCC tissues. Serum ORC1 levels were significantly higher in HBV-infected patients than in non-HBV-infected controls (980.11 ng/L  Serum ORC1, driven by HBV integration, is a promising biomarker especially for AFP-negative HBV-HCC. Its combination with ESPL1 and AFP significantly improves early detection.",
