  "abstract": "The interaction of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides with the plasma membrane (PM) is a potential trigger that initiates the formation of higher-order aggregates, membrane alterations/damage, and progressive neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies showed neurons initiate PM repair upon damage induced by Aβ aggregates, and dysfunctional repair mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized molecular coupling between Rab3a-mediated exocytosis and pPAK1-driven endocytosis as a pivotal mechanism of PM repair in neuronal cells and primary neurons exposed to aggregation-prone oligomers of Aβ (oAβ). Unlike earlier reports that broadly associated PM damage and repair with Aβ aggregates, we specifically demonstrate that toxic oAβ",
