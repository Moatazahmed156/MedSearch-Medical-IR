    "abstract": "Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, once considered passive support cells, are now recognized as active participants in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role that these glial cells play in the pathological features of Alzheimer's, including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and myelin degeneration, which contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Here, we review the current understanding of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight research that supports the therapeutic potential of modulating astrocyte and oligodendrocyte functions to treat Alzheimer's disease.",
