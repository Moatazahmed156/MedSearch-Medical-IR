  "title": "Confronting nihilism and stigma in lung cancer: The nurse practitioner's role in restoring hope and trust.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, yet profound advances in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship have redefined what is possible for patients. Despite this progress, nihilism, fatalism, and stigma continue to shape public and professional perceptions, discouraging screening and delaying help-seeking. Nurse practitioners occupy a central and trusted position across the lung cancer continuum and are uniquely equipped to counter these barriers through compassionate, stigma-informed communication. This perspective article synthesizes current evidence to illuminate how nurse practitioners can translate empathy, equity, and behavioral science into tangible practice actions that reduce stigma and nihilism and instill compassion and hope. Key strengths-language, empathy, tobacco treatment integration, social context awareness, community engagement, and hope-form the \"Permission to Hope\" framework. By leveraging these strengths, nurse practitioners can transform everyday interactions into opportunities to rebuild trust, improve screening participation, and redefine what survivorship means in lung cancer care.",
