    "abstract": "Class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3) are secreted glycoproteins with established roles in the developing brain, heart, and kidney. In this issue of Kidney International, Cai et al. show that in acutely injured kidneys, semaphorin isoform SEMA3C is expressed de novo in glomeruli and the nephron, secreted into the circulation, and excreted into the urine. Compelling evidence is provided for SEMA3C promoting microvascular permeability, kidney swelling, and acute injury. SEMA3C antagonism may be a treatment option for acute kidney injury.",
