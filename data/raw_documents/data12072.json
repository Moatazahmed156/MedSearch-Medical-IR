  "title": "A comparative study of subpleural and nonsubpleural malignant pulmonary nodules treated with CT-guided co-ablation: Our experience.",
  "abstract": "This retrospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of co-ablation (Co-A) for subpleural malignant pulmonary nodules (SMPNs). A total of 88 consecutive malignant lung tumor patients treated for Co-A were retrospectively reviewed. Subpleural lesions were assessed using computed tomography (CT). In the lung window, a distance of 1 cm between the nodule and the pleura was defined as subpleural. Overall, 68 patients comprising 41 men and 27 women (mean age, 63.54 ± 13.82 years; age range, 15-87 years) were enrolled, dividing into the SMPN group (n = 53) and the nonsubpleural malignant pulmonary nodules group (NSMPN, n = 15). The mean tumor size was 22.78 ± 6.30 mm (range, 10-30 mm). Follow-up was conducted using CT at 1, 3, and 6 months after Co-A, and the complications and safety profiles were recorded. The technical success rate was 100%. No significant difference in overall complication rate was observed between the SMPN (40.7%, 24/59) and NSMPN (50.6%, 10/19) groups (χ2 = 0.835, P = 0.361). The median follow-up duration in all patients was 5.38 ± 3.14 months (range, 3-14 months). The 3- and 6-month local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rates in the SMPN and NSMPN groups were 97.7% and 100%, respectively, and 90.9% and 100%, respectively (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that Co-A may be a safe and effective treatment strategy for SMPNs.",
