  "title": "Assessment of the Role of Telocyte Zbtb16 in Lymphatic Drainage using Efhd1-CreERT2 x Zbtb16",
  "abstract": "Lymphatic function is critical for maintaining fluid homeostasis and immune surveillance in synovial tissues, and its dysfunction is implicated in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Zbtb16, a transcription factor involved in cellular differentiation that is downregulated in mice with inflammatory arthritis and lymphatic defects, has been linked to skeletal development and immune regulation, but its direct role in lymphatic function remains unexplored. To investigate this, we generated Zbtb16",
  "disease": "rheumatoid arthritis"
