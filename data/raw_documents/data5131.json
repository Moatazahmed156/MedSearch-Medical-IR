    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension is common in left heart disease and is related most commonly to passive back transmission of elevated left atrial pressures. Some patients, however, may develop pulmonary vascular remodeling superimposed on their left-sided heart disease. This review provides a contemporary appraisal of existing criteria to diagnose a precapillary component to pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease as well as discusses etiologies, management issues, and future directions.",
