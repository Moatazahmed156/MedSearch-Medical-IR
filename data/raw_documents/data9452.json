  "title": "Combined with the insulin resistance index in assessing subclinical systolic function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus: an analysis based on automated functional imaging echocardiography.",
  "abstract": "In recent years, simpler and more practical indicators based on routine biochemical tests or anthropometric measurements have been widely utilized for the assessment of insulin sensitivity. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the predictive value of these novel simplified measures in relation to subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A total of 160 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T Competing risk regression revealed that body mass index(BMI), interventricular septal diameter(IVSD), systolic blood pressure(SBP) and left atrium(LA) were significant risk factors for the reduction of GLS in individuals with T2DM. Additionally, two IR index models were found to be closely associated with abnormal GLS: TyG-BMI (6.227,p = 0.000); METS-IR(7.436,p = 0.000). ROC analysis results indicate that TyG-BMI, METS-IR, IVSD, SBP, LA and a combination of five other indexes have demonstrated certain efficacy in predicting and evaluating diabetic heart function reduction. Its ROC-AUC (0.95CI) are 0.750 (0.564 ~ 0.934), 0.774 (0.582 ~ 0.944), 0.702 (0.461 ~ 0.948), 0.737 (0.478 ~ 0.983), 0.726 (0.483 ~ 0.951), 0.878 (0.770 ~ 0.987) respectively. Approximately 20% of newly diagnosed patients with T Not applicable.",
