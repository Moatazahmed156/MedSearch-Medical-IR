    "abstract": "Chemokines secreted by astrocytes play multiple roles in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, a chronic inflammation disorder of central nervous system. The level of chemokines in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue and their receptors both significantly changed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we briefly summarized the involvement of astrocytes and chemokines in Alzheimer's disease, and the role of chemokine/chemokine receptors in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease. Clarification of the involvement of chemokines and their receptors, such as MCP-1/CCR2, fractalkine/CX3CR1, SDF-1α/CXCR4, MIP-1α/CCR5, IP-10/CXCR3, IL-8/CXCR1, CXCR2, and RANTES/CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, will provide a new strategy and more specific targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
