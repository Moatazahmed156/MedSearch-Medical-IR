    "abstract": "Yellow fever has been recently described in nonurban areas of Brazil despite 80 years of commercial vaccine use. Although the disease does not spread fear in the general population as it did in the past, yellow fever virus continues to cause many cases of severe disease. Persistence of the virus in the host is a new mechanism to be considered in the pathology of the disease. Immunization with a fractional dose of vaccine during emergency situations needs to be evaluated for antibody duration, and new and improved vaccines should be considered.",
