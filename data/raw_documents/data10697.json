  "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its receptor LPA1 have been implicated in tissue inflammation and fibrosis; however, their role in mucus overproduction remains unclear. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), which are rare airway epithelial cells, contribute to mucus overproduction and immune modulation. In this study, we investigated the role of the LPA/LPA1 receptor axis in goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus overproduction, as well as the contribution of PNECs, using a chronic mouse model of bronchial asthma. A chronic mouse model of asthma was established by sensitization and challenge with the house dust mite antigen Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), with or without treatment using the LPA1 antagonist AM095. Airway hyperresponsiveness, histopathology, mediator concentrations, and molecular expression in lung homogenate supernatants were evaluated. Lysophospholipid levels and low-molecular-weight metabolites were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Lung LPA 22:5 levels were elevated in Dp-challenged mice. LPA1 receptors were co-localized with PNECs in the lung. Treatment with AM095 reduced goblet cell hyperplasia by inhibiting the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by PNECs. It also suppressed arginase 1 and polyamine production in CGRP-stimulated M2 macrophages. AM095 did not affect eosinophil extracellular trap (EET) formation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which activates PNECs. The LPA/LPA1 axis promotes goblet cell hyperplasia through PNEC activation and downstream GABA and CGRP signaling in a chronic asthma model. LPA1 antagonism may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling mucus overproduction in asthma.",
