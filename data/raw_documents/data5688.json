    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the development of the immune system and confers benefits or disease susceptibility to the host. Emerging studies have indicated the gut microbiota could aﬀect pulmonary health and disease through cross talk between the gut microbiota and the lungs. Gut microbiota dysbiosis could lead to acute or chronic lung disease, such as asthma, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. In addition, the composition of the gut microbiota may be associated with different lung diseases, the prevalence of which also varies by age. Modulation of the gut microbiota through short-chain fatty acids, probiotics, and micronutrients may present potential therapeutic strategies to protect against lung diseases. In this review, we will provide an overview of the cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the lungs, as well as elucidate the underlying pathogenesis and/or potential therapeutic strategies of some lung diseases from the point of view of the gut microbiota.",
