    "abstract": "The validity of the history and physical examination varies with study method and the gold standard used. In general, symptoms are more sensitive than specific, and most patients with radiculopathy do present with some characteristic complaints. With the exception of the ipsilateral SLR, most physical examination findings are more specific than sensitive. In patients with suspected radiculopathy, having at least one abnormal physical examination finding makes the probability of having an abnormal electrodiagnostic study more likely than if the results of the physical examination are normal. Having a normal physical examination, however, does not rule out the possibility of having a radiculopathy that is revealed either electrodiagnostically or surgically. Although the history and physical examination may not be perfect tools for the diagnosis of radiculopathy or predicting electrodiagnostic outcome, they are an essential part of the clinical evaluation to assist in formulating a differential diagnosis and guiding the electrodiagnostic study.",
