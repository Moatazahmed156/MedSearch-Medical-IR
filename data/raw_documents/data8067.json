    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this review was to discuss cardiometabolic risk factors that affect women.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Recent calls to action to address cardiometabolic risk factors specific to women relate to increasing evidence of sex-specific differences in patient-related, drug-related, and socio-demographic factors leading to sub-optimal care of women.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Certain aspects of common modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes) affect female individuals more adversely. Additionally, there are risk factors or enhancers that particularly affect cardiometabolic health in women [e.g. premature menopause, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), familial partial lipodystrophy, socio-cultural factors]. Understanding these risk factors may provide insight on how to improve cardiometabolic outcomes in women.",
