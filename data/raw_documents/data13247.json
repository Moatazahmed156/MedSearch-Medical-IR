  "title": "An online platform to increase access to gait rehabilitation for underserved Parkinson's disease communities.",
  "abstract": "Compensation strategies are a key element of gait rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease, ideally requiring involvement of specialized therapists. However, access to allied healthcare is not universally guaranteed. We evaluated an online platform to deliver compensation strategies for gait in 25 individuals with Parkinson's in rural Brazil. After three weeks of use, median patient-reported impact of gait impairment on daily activities [rated on visual analogue scale, 0-10] decreased from 7 to 4 (p < 0.001), without reported falls. This suggest that the platform is a safe and effective tool for supporting gait rehabilitation in underserved communities with limited access to healthcare services.
