    "abstract": "Autoimmune enteropathy is an extremely rare condition characterized by an abnormal intestinal immune response which typically manifests within the first 6 months of life as severe, intractable diarrhea that does not respond to dietary modification. Affected individuals frequently present with other signs of autoimmunity. The diagnosis is made based on a characteristic combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory studies, and histological features on small bowel biopsy. Autoimmune enteropathy is associated with a number of other conditions and syndromes, most notably immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1). Diagnosis and treatment is challenging, and further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis, disease progression, and long-term outcomes of these conditions.",
