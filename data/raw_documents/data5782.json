    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review the characteristic CT and MRI findings associated with monogenetic causes of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in children and young adults. CONCLUSION. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in children and young adults remains a common cause of acquired disability but is underrecognized. Brain parenchymal and vascular imaging is commonly performed as part of the comprehensive evaluation of young patients presenting with stroke. Familiarity with these patterns of disease enables early recognition of an underlying inherited condition.",
