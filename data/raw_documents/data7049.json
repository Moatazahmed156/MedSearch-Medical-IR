    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest malignant tumors in the female reproductive system. Currently, an efficient approach for the early detection and reliable prognosis assessment of ovarian cancer remains unavailable, which is still a difficult problem worthy of study. In recent years, cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) has attracted attention in tumor biology, it provides new possibilities for solving ovarian cancer problems. Although CD47 still has many challenges in clinical practice, such as standardization of detection methods and joint application strategies with other biomarkers, it still shows its potential as a biomarker. This article reviews some serum biomarkers in ovarian cancer, the biological characteristics of CD47, prospects and challenges faced as a biomarker in ovarian cancer, aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of CD47 application in ovarian cancer.",
