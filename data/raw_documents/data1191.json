    "abstract": "Choi et al reported the effect of hyperuricaemia on the new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). I present three queries. (i) Insulin is considered to stimulate uric acid reabsorption via specific transporter and the effect of hyperuricaemia on the new-onset T2DM should be evaluated by considering insulin resistance. (ii) There is a limitation in the number of events for stable estimates. (iii) Obesity and sex should be considered for the analysis.",
