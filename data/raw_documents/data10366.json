  "abstract": "While fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for assessing coronary stenosis, non-hyperemic pressure ratios (NHPRs) such as the resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) are used as less invasive alternatives. However, NHPR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been reported to be associated with poorer outcomes. We hypothesized that the difference between RFR and FFR (RFR-FFR) carries important clinical information. This retrospective study included 460 patients with chronic coronary syndrome who underwent FFR-guided elective PCI following functional assessment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with both RFR and FFR. Patients were stratified into tertiles based on their RFR-FFR value. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Patients in the lowest RFR-FFR tertile presented with a higher-risk clinical profile including older age, female sex, and greater comorbidity burden such as elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and lower renal function, and evidence of microvascular dysfunction such as lower coronary flow reserve and microvascular resistance reserve. During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, lower RFR-FFR patients showed higher rate of all-cause death. Multivariable analysis identified age and baseline heart rate as independent predictors of a low RFR-FFR value. Crucially, a multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that a low RFR-FFR value was an independent predictor of all-cause death. A lower RFR-FFR value is a marker of increased comorbidities and microvascular dysfunction, correlating with poorer long-term clinical outcomes. This pre-PCI novel metric holds potential utility for risk stratification and personalizing treatment strategies in patients with chronic coronary artery disease undergoing LAD PCI.",
