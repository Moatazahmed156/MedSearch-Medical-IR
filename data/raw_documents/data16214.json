  "title": "A Dual-Targeted, Long-Circulating, and Intelligent-Responsive Antiviral Agent Suppresses SARS-CoV-2 by Blocking Viral Entry and Replication.",
  "abstract": "Various natural drugs such as glycyrrhizic acid (GA), hesperidin (Hes), and baicalin (Bai) exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential but suffer from poor water solubility, short half-life, and low binding capacity to viral targets. Hence, a dual-targeted, long-circulating, ROS-responsive, and broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor (mPAGHB) is designed through a strategy of \"polymer-drug linkage\". The mPAGHB suppresses SARS-CoV-2 through two \"lines of defense\", including extracellular inhibition of the \"spike protein-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)\" process and intracellular inhibition of the enzymatic activity of major protease. It exhibits higher affinity for spike protein (",
