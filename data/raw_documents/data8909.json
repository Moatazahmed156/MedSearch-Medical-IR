    "abstract": "Background: Umbilical cord haematomas may result in mortality or significant morbidity due to interference with vital fetal blood flow. Case report: We present a massive umbilical haematoma in a asymptomatic neonate without risk factors or hypoxic event. Conclusion: Although massive umbilical haematomas may result in miscarriage and fetal hypoxia, in some cases there may be no complications.",
