    "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of habitat quality (HQ) on the reproduction and bioenergetics (energy reserve and metabolic enzyme activities) of the oribatid mite, Oppia nitens, in response to cadmium (Cd). In the baseline toxicity test, Cd elevated the carbohydrate reserve of adult mites at intermediate Cd concentrations (88 and 175 mg Cd kg-1) but without a change in lipid and protein reserve across 0-700 mg Cd kg-1. The activities of glucose metabolism enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were inhibited in the mites at 700 mg Cd kg-1. Adult mites reared in high HQ soils had higher reproduction relative to mites from low HQ soils when exposed to Cd in OECD soil, but there was no difference in bioenergetics between mites from low and high HQ soils. Hence, HQ significantly (p = 0.024) influenced the reproduction of mites (i.e., juvenile production) irrespective of the Cd concentration in the OECD soil but did not significantly affect the bioenergetics of the mites. We suggest that habitat quality's effect could be more significant than metal concentration on the biological fitness (juvenile production) of O. nitens in metal-contaminated soils.",
