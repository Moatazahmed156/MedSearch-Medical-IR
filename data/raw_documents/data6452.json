    "abstract": "Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, is a harmful factor that damages kidneys. Chronic heat stress in laying hens causes renal injury; however, whether IS accumulation is involved in this injury remains unknown. We selected 20 Boris brown laying hens (27 weeks old) and randomly assigned them to two groups (n = 10), one group was exposed to chronic heat stress (32 °C for 4 weeks), whereas the other was maintained at 24 °C. Chronic heat exposure significantly increased plasma and renal IS concentrations (P < 0.05). Exposure to heat also increased renal expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its target genes (CYP1A4 and CYP1B1). Furthermore, chronic heat exposure tended to increase the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content (P = 0.08) and significantly decreased the antioxidant capacity in the kidney, while increasing the transcription levels of nuclear factor κB and fibrosis-related genes (COLA1A1, αSMA, TGF-β, Smad3, and VCAM-1) and the area of renal fibrosis. Our results indicate that chronic heat exposure induces systemic and renal IS accumulation in laying hens. This accumulated IS may activate the AhR pathway and chronically disrupt the oxidative stress status and antioxidant activity, thus promoting renal fibrosis and dysfunction in laying hens.",
