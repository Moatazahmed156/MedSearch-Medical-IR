  "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are frequently tested in specialized research settings, which limits the generalizability of findings. Using electronic health records and banked plasma, we evaluated plasma biomarkers-phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau Participants (n = 617; 44% Black/African American; 41% female) were selected from the University of Pennsylvania Medicine BioBank with plasma assayed using Fujirebio Lumipulse. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth and Tenth Revision codes determined AD dementia (ADD) (n = 43), mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 140), unspecified/non-AD cognitive impairment (CI) (n = 106), and cognitively normal cases (n = 328), and other medical histories. APOE ε4, body mass index (BMI), metrics of kidney function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), and liver disease were derived from electronic health records. Multivariable models identified factors related to plasma levels. Previously established cutpoints classified AD status (\"AD+,\" \"AD-,\" or \"Intermediate\").
