    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Self-medication practices are widely practiced globally as major form of self-care for pain management. Unfortunately, with COVID-19 pandemic, prescription only drugs are now increasingly being self-prescribed. Present study was therefore, conducted to generate data on self-medication practice with analgesics using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and the antibiotics among nursing students of University College Farasan Campus.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 177 study participants (20±3 years) between December 2019 to February 2020 using questionnaire. Data analyses were done using origin software (6.1, Illinois, USA). Significance was considered at P<0.05. Study was conducted in Department of Nursing, University College Farasan Province, a premier educational institute of Farasan Island affiliated to Jazan university, KSA.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Self-medication practices were high among nursing students (n=154 participants, 87%). Acetaminophen was highest used drug for analgesic purposes without prescriptions (n=101 participants, 57%). Among NSAIDs, Ibuprofen was most preferred for various analgesic purposes (n=35 participants, 20%) followed by diclofenac (n=9 participants, 5%) and meloxicam (n=5 participants, 3%). Azithromycine was the only antibiotic used by participants (n=4 participant, 2%). Most common causes of self-medication were headache (45%), menstrual pain (23%) and fever (14%). Main reason for self-medications was lack of time to consult doctor (68%). Furthermore, self-medication was significantly associated with study year (P<0.003).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Results give rise to concern for general well-being of future nursing workforce. There is need to implement educational actions and awareness programmes to limit self-medication practices among educated youth of this beautiful Island.",
