  "title": "Recent Advances in the Biosensors for the Detection of Lung Cancer Biomarkers: A Review.",
  "abstract": "Nearly 10 million deaths from cancer occurred in 2020, making it a major cause of death globally, according to the WHO and other important statistics. Given that lung cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer, it accounts for around 25% of all deaths from cancer-related causes. The two forms of lung cancer that are treated and characterized differently are small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer. To identify malignant cells, several techniques have been used in recent decades, including MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography scans), and PET (positron emission tomography). The standard detection threshold of conventional assays is insufficient for early-stage detection. As a result, numerous detection techniques have been used to identify lung cancer early. The stages of lung cancer are indicated by the amounts of these biomarkers. As a result, lung cancer screening and clinical diagnosis can be accomplished by the identification of biomarkers. EGFR, CEA, CYFRA 21-1, ENO1, NSE, CA 19-9, CA 125, and VEGF are among the many biomarkers for lung cancer. To identify lung cancer disease biomarkers, an organized summary of several biosensing platforms is given in this article. In particular, it addresses the most recent advancements in optical and electrochemical biosensors, the analytical capabilities of various biosensors, the challenges, and potential directions for future study in regular clinical analysis. Therefore, this study reviews the latest developments and enhancements (2011-2025) in biosensors for the identification of biomarkers for lung cancer.",
