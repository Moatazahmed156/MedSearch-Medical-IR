    "abstract": "The incidence of arrhythmia after myocardial infarction has declined since the introduction of reperfusion techniques. Nevertheless, ischemic arrhythmias are often associated with increased morbidity and mortality particularly in the first 48 hours after hospital admission. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the epidemiology, characteristics, and management of ischemic tachy- and brady-arrhythmias focusing on the period shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).",
