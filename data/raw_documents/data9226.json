    "abstract": "Myocardial stunning is a temporary post-ischemic cardiac mechanical dysfunction. As such, it is a heterogeneous entity and different conditions can promote its occurrence. Transient coronary occlusion, increased production of catecholamines and endothelin, and myocardial inflammation are all possible causes of myocardial stunning. Possible underlying mechanisms include an oxyradical hypothesis, calcium overload, decreased responsiveness of myofilaments to calcium, and excitation-contraction uncoupling due to sarcoplasmic reticulum dysfunction. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical conditions that may be responsible for stunned myocardium.",
