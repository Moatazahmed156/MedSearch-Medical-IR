  "title": "[QregPV - a regional quality register of patients in primary care with hypertension or coronary artery disease].",
  "abstract": "For Swedish patients with diabetes or recent myocardial infarction, there is good information about treatment through national quality registers. However, for the much larger patient group with essential hypertension, corresponding information is lacking. QregPV, a quality register in the Västra Götaland region, provides insight into 15 years of treatment of 250,000 patients in primary care with essential hypertension or coronary artery disease. Despite increasingly better treatment over 15 years, the register shows large unexplained practice differences with significant potential for reduced secondary morbidity and healthcare costs. These data from QregPV raise important questions about the implementation of guideline recommendations in real practice.",
