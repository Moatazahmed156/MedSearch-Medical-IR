  "title": "Evaluating prodromal symptoms and health locus of control as predictors of seizure reactivity and neuropsychiatric outcomes in drug-resistant epilepsy: a cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "Epileptic prodromes have historically received limited attention due to their subjective nature and limited localizing value. However, they hold potential for seizure prediction, which could significantly influence epilepsy management. This cross-sectional research aimed to examine whether the presence and characteristics of epileptic prodromes relate to seizure reactivity, Health Locus of Control (HLC), anxiety, and depression in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). A cross-sectional study of DRE patients which evaluated clinical variables, prodromal symptoms, reactivity to prodromes, HLC, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Seventy-four patients (22 men, 29.7 %; 52 women, 70.3 %) were included; mean age was 42.3 ± 14.6 years. Mean age at epilepsy onset was 14.9 ± 12.3 years, and mean disease duration was 27.5 ± 16.0 years. Significant negative correlations were observed between internal HLC and anxiety (rho = -0.347, p = 0.002) and depression (rho = -0.488, p < 0.001). Conversely, chance HLC correlated positively with disease duration (rho = 0.319, p = 0.006) and depression (rho = 0.367, p = 0.001). Patients reporting three or more prodromal symptom types had sixfold increased odds of seizure reactivity (OR = 6.25, 95 % CI = 2.11-18.46, p = 0.001). The belief that one's own actions, behaviors, and internal factors are responsible for their health outcomes appears protective against anxiety and depression in individuals with DRE. Longer epilepsy duration and higher depression levels are associated with a belief that health outcomes are governed by luck or fate. Reporting prodromes significantly increases the likelihood of seizure reactivity, highlighting their potential role in seizure forecasting.",
