    "abstract": "The incidence of colorectal cancer in young adults (CRCYAs) is increasing globally, and it is now the third leading cause of cancer death among young adults under 50 years old. The rising incidence is attributed to various emerging risk factors such as genetics, lifestyle factors, and microbiome profiles. Delayed diagnosis and more advanced disease presentation contribute to worse outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to care is crucial to ensure comprehensive and personalized treatment plans for CRCYA.",
