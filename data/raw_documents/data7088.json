    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence and management of back pain in MS patients was assessed by a systematic review, and the results of a survey on the characteristics of low back pain in a sample of French MS patients are reported.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The outcomes of interest included the prevalence of back pain, severity of pain and impact on daily activities. Moreover, the prevalence of low back pain and its consequences on daily living in a large French MS population were assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fourteen studies were included in the systematic review. The prevalence of back pain in MS patients ranged from 8.6 to 50%, but that of low back pain in particular ranged from 41.6 to 52.4%. Concerning the survey, 237 patients participated in the online questionnaire. The prevalence of low back pain in the French MS patients was 76.4%. The patients with chronic low back pain had more limitations in their daily life activities than those without chronic low back pain.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients with MS commonly suffer from low back pain, but it is still an underdiagnosed cause of pain that reduces one's ability to perform activities in daily life.",
