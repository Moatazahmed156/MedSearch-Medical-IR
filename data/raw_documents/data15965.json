  "title": "Stroke Management in the Intensive Care Unit: Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke Care.",
  "abstract": "Stroke is the second-largest cause of death and disability worldwide, and many patients require intensive care for airway compromise, hemodynamic instability, cerebral edema, or systemic complications. This review summarizes key aspects of ICU management in both acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS). Priorities are airway protection, oxygenation, individualized blood pressure targets, and strict control of temperature and glucose. Neurological monitoring and prompt management of intracranial pressure (ICP), together with timely surgical interventions (hemicraniectomy or hematoma evacuation), are central to acute care. Seizures are treated promptly, while routine prophylaxis is not recommended. Prevention of aspiration pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, infections, and other intensive care unit (ICU) complications is essential, along with early nutrition, mobilization, and rehabilitation. Prognosis and decisions about intensity of care require shared discussions with families and involvement of palliative services, when appropriate. Many practices remain based on observational data or extrapolation from other populations, underlining the need for stroke-specific clinical trials. Outcomes are consistently better when patients are managed in specialized stroke or neurocritical care units with a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",
