    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      An infraclavicular pedicled flap (ICPF) was recently described in the literature. This anatomical region is attractive for the restoration of head and neck oncological defects. This paper is a review of our experience with this versatile flap.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the records of all the patients operated in a tertiary-care center between August 2013 and January 2019 whose surgery involved an ICPF.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Forty-four patients received an ICPF for various indications, including large vessel coverage in neck/parotid recontouring (34.1%), postlaryngectomy reconstruction (34.1%), and fistula closure (25.0%). All flaps survived. Thirteen patients experienced a postoperative complication (29.5%), six of whom (13.9%) required a repeat procedure under general anesthesia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      ICPF is suitable for several indications and is a useful adjunctive tool in head and neck reconstruction. It proved to have a high survival rate, with complication rates similar to other regional flaps.",
