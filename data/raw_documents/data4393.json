    "abstract": "The objective of this review was to analyze the effect of dietary selenium on oxidative stress in horses by considering past and recent bibliographic sources. Some research was done on oxidative stress, related pathologies and how selenium regulates oxidative stress. Oxidizing molecules are molecules that can accept electrons from the substances with which they react. Oxidizing These molecules, of oxidizing, are found naturally in any organism, and there are antioxidant mechanisms that regulate its activity. However, when the body is stressed, oxidizing molecules outperform the antioxidants, causing an imbalance known as oxidative stress. Among antioxidant molecules, selenium can act as an important antioxidant in the body. The antioxidant activity is based on an enzyme called glutathione peroxidase, which depends on selenium and controls the activity of oxidizing molecules.",
