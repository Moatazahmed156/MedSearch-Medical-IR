    "abstract": "This review highlights the emerging role of the immune checkpoint receptor T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) as a crucial modulator in the prostate's microbiome-immune axis, with significant implications for prostate-related diseases such as prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer. These conditions reflect the prostate's susceptibility to immune dysregulation, which is influenced by microbial communities and their metabolites. TIM-3, already known for its role in immune regulation in cancer and chronic infections, is now recognized for its potential to shape immune responses within the prostate by modulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) and influencing inflammation and tolerance. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and pro-inflammatory bacterial components like lipoteichoic acid can alter TIM-3 expression, contributing to immune imbalance. Therapeutic strategies targeting TIM-3 aim to restore immune equilibrium, while complementary microbiome-focused approaches, such as probiotics, dietary interventions, pH modulation, and enhancement of epithelial antimicrobial peptides, may further prevent microbial overgrowth and inflammation. Drawing parallels with therapies for inflammatory bowel disease and other immune-related conditions, the integration of TIM-3 blockade with microbiota modulation presents a promising avenue for managing chronic prostate inflammation and cancer. This review proposes a multi-omics and bioinformatics-driven framework for developing TIM-3-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
