  "title": "Hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver: a prospective Spanish multicenter study.",
  "abstract": "Prospective data on non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (NC-HCC) are scarce, mainly in Western countries. Characteristics, evolution, prognostic factors and outcomes were analyzed. One hundred and forty-one NC-HCC diagnosed by histology were included in a Spanish multicenter prospective registry (2018-2023) involving 23 centers. Liver cirrhosis was excluded by histology, transient elastography or level 2 Mittal criteria. Underlying chronic liver disease was present in 77% of patients, mainly MASLD/MetALD and viral. Using the aMAP risk score less than 10% of patients were classified in the low-risk group. Fibrosis stage was 0-1 in 53%. A single nodule was detected in 75%. The BCLC stage was 0 in 6.5%, A in 63.8%, B in 17.7%, C in 11.3% and D in 0.7%. Initial treatment was surgical resection in 63.9%, ablation in 4.2%, TACE/TARE in 13.5%, systemic therapy in 14.9%, and symptomatic treatment in 3.5%. Median follow-up was 34.1 (IQR: 15.5-49.5) months. Median overall survival was 47.9 months (95% CI: not assessable), and global 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate were 85%, 62.4% and 49.1%, respectively. AFP level (<20/≥20ng/ml) [HR: 2.63 (1.3-5.3), p=0.007] was an independent predictor of survival. In surgically treated patients, the 5-year recurrence rate and 5-year survival rate were 55.1% and 59.1%, respectively. Active lifestyle (HR 0.27 [95% CI: 0.09-0.8]) and microvascular invasion and/or satellite nodules (HR 3.03 [95% CI: 1.18-7.75]) were independent predictors of mortality. Despite the lack of routine screening, most patients with NC-HCC were diagnosed at early stages and treated with surgery. The main underlying etiology was MASLD/MetALD and a sedentary lifestyle was associated with mortality, so interventions to improve this aspect are essential.",
