    "abstract": "Pressure overload can lead to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Autophagic activity could be detected in heart failure patients and animal models. However, the role of autophagy in heart failure is not clear. In this chapter, we will outline the role of macroautophagy and mitophagy in heart failure and the mechanisms underlying regulation.",
