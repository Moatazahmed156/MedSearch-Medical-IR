  "title": "Telemedicine education for caregivers and asthma control in children: a randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "Poorly controlled pediatric asthma increases morbidity, reduces quality of life, and raises healthcare use. Caregiver education on asthma and medication use is essential for control. In Vietnam, pediatric asthma services are centralized at tertiary centers, limiting access for many families. Telemedicine may help bridge these gaps. To evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine education on asthma control in children with uncontrolled asthma and its impact on caregiver knowledge, attitudes, and children's MDI technique. We conducted a pragmatic randomized clinical trial among children aged 4-16 years with uncontrolled asthma. Participants were randomized 1:1, stratified by age and sex, to receive either a structured educational video call or a brief scheduling call. Changes in C-ACT/ACT scores, caregiver knowledge, caregiver attitudes, and children's MDI technique were compared between groups. A multivariable generalized linear model was used to identify factors associated with improvement in asthma control. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. At a median follow-up of five weeks (IQR 4-8), C-ACT scores were higher in the intervention than control group (median 25.0 vs 19.5,  Telemedicine-based education improved asthma control and caregiver-related outcomes and may serve as an effective supportive strategy where access to pediatric asthma services is limited.",
