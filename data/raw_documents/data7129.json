    "abstract": "Background and objectives:\n        \n      \n      Low back pain is a common syndrome that causes disability and absence from work. Although there are several causes, the most common type of back pain is nonspecific. Exercises are often used to treat back pain, but there is controversy regarding its effectiveness. The aim of this paper is to review exercises for nonspecific low back pain treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Content:\n        \n      \n      This paper provides a definition and classification of back pain. Incidence and mechanisms of nonspecific low back pain and exercises used for its treatment are hereby reported.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The most effective types of exercise therapy for chronic or acute low back pain are still controversial; however, exercise therapy is probably the most widely used conservative treatment throughout the world.",
