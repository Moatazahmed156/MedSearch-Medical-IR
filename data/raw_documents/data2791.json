    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, zebrafish, Danio rerio, have become a mainstream laboratory animal model, yet zebrafish husbandry practices remain far from standardized. Feeding protocols play a critical role in the health, wellbeing, and productivity of zebrafish laboratories, yet they vary significantly between facilities. In this study, we compared our current feeding protocol for juvenile zebrafish (30 dpf to 75 dpf), a 3:1mixture of fish flake and freeze-dried krill fed twice per day with live artemia twice per day (FKA), to a diet of Gemma Micro 300 fed once per day with live artemia once per day (GMA). Our results showed that juvenile EK wild-type zebrafish fed GMA were longer and heavier than juveniles fed FKA. As compared with FKA-fed juveniles, fish fed GMA as juveniles showed better reproductive performance as measured by spawning success, fertilization rate, and clutch size. As adults, fish from both feeding protocols were acclimated to our standard adult feeding protocol, and the long-term effects of juvenile diet were assessed. At 2 y of age, the groups showed no difference in mortality or fecundity. Reproductive performance is a crucial aspect of zebrafish research, as much of the research focuses on the developing embryo. Here we show that switching juvenile zebrafish from a mixture of flake and krill to Gemma Micro 300 improves reproductive performance, even with fewer feedings of live artemia, thus simplifying husbandry practices.",
