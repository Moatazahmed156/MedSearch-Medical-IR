  "abstract": "Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood glucose in the body. Hypoglycemic peptides are bioactive peptides that effectively control type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared to general small-molecule drugs, they offer distinct advantages, including a clear structure, well-defined mechanism of action, potent activity, low immunogenicity, and fewer toxicities or side effects. This paper introduces the source, preparation, analysis, and purification of hypoglycemic peptides, and focuses on the physiological functions, mechanisms of action, and structures of hypoglycemic peptides, which mainly exert their glucose-lowering effects through the inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme activities as well as through their hydrophobic amino acids. This paper summarizes the existing research results on the clinical application of hypoglycemic peptides in medicine and preclinical application, looks forward to the development potential of hypoglycemic peptides in the field of food, and summarizes the multiple effects of hypoglycemic peptides as a class of bioactive peptides. The paper also points out the shortcomings of the current research status of hypoglycemic peptides, which provides a theoretical basis for the future research and development of hypoglycemic peptide drugs or functional foods and guides the direction of the overall development of hypoglycemic peptides.",
