    "abstract": "Spinal cord pathologic condition often presents as a neurologic emergency where timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to expedite appropriate treatment and minimize severe morbidity and even mortality. MR imaging is the gold standard imaging technique for diagnosing patients with suspected spinal cord pathologic condition. This review will focus on the basic principles of diffusion imaging and how spinal anatomy presents technical challenges to its application. Both the promises and shortcomings of spinal diffusion imaging will then be explored in the context of several clinical spinal cord pathologies for which diffusion has been evaluated.",
