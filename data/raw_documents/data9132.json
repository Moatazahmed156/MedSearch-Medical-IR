    "abstract": "Undifferentiated cells, known as stem cells, have the capacity to self-renew and specialise in a variety of distinct mature and functional cell types while still retaining their original identity. For their significance in regenerative medicine, stem cells' deep potential has been widely examined, and this work has established the groundwork for cell-based therapeutics. With the potential to repair and restore specific organs or tissue injuries or chronic disease situations when the body's regenerative process is insufficient to heal, regenerative medicine is quickly advancing in healthcare. The most recent developments in stem cell-based treatments for regenerative medicine are covered in this review, focusing on mesenchymal stem cell-based treatments because these cells have received the most clinical research. The most recent applications of artificial intelligence algorithms in stem cell-based therapeutics are presented, along with their limitations and potential future applications.",
