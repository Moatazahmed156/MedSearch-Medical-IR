    "abstract": "Background/aim:\n        \n      \n      Previous investigations showed that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a high percentage of a peripheral CD4+ T cell subset were more likely to have severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to anti-PD-1 therapy. The present study investigated the relationship between a peripheral CD4+ T cell subset and T cell immunity in the non-tumor lung tissues of patients with NSCLC to clarify the rationale of predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed the T cell profiles and functions in peripheral blood and non-tumor lung tissues surgically resected from patients with NSCLC.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In patients with NSCLC with a high percentage of the peripheral CD4+ T cell subset (CD45RA+CD25+CD4+ T cells), non-tumor lung tissues had a high percentage of PD-1+CD4+ T cells and a low percentage of PD-1+ effector regulatory T (Treg) cells. The percentage of PD-1+ effector Treg cells negatively correlated with IFNγ and TNFα production by CD4+ T cells in the lung tissues of patients with NSCLC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients with NSCLC with a high percentage of the peripheral CD4+ T cell subset are at an increased risk of anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis, which activates PD-1+CD4+ T cells in the absence of the suppressive activity of effector Treg cells in lung tissues.",
