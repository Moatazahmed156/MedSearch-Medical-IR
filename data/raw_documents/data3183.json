    "abstract": "A case of ulcerative colitis complicated by oesophageal ulcers is reported. A woman was admitted to our hospital because of exacerbations of ulcerative colitis both in 1992 (aged 15 years) and 1995 (aged 18 years). When she was admitted in 1995 she complained of bloody diarrhoea, sore throat and pain on swallowing. Oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy revealed oesophageal ulcers. Oesophageal pH monitoring (24-h) showed no evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. After the patient was treated she with oral prednisolone showed considerable improvement clinically and endoscopically. Initial dosage was 60 mg/day, and 1 week later, the dosage was gradually dropped since the patient responded favourably. The improvement of the oesophageal lesions coincided with the remission of ulcerative colitis. The oesophageal ulcers are, therefore, thought to be an extracolonic manifestation of ulcerative colitis.",
