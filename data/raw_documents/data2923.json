    "abstract": "The goal of the physical examination is to obtain valid information concerning the health of the patient. The examiner must be able to identify, analyze, and synthesize the accumulated information into a comprehensive assessment. This article outlines the details of the examinations of the individual organ systems that should be evaluated during a podiatric screening physical examination. Some parts of the physical examination have been omitted intentionally. Attention is paid to the recognition of pedal manifestations of systemic disease.",
