  "title": "The Australia New Zealand respiratory audit programme: a new paradigm to improve respiratory care.",
  "abstract": "Chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, pose substantial challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, which are projected to grow in coming years. Variations in care represent a threat to health equity and must be identified and remedied. Robust auditing systems can improve healthcare effectiveness and efficiency by identifying strengths and weaknesses in existing service models. The Australia New Zealand Respiratory Audit Programme (ANZRAP) is a new funded research and quality improvement programme commencing in 2025 aiming to improve quality of care, clinical outcomes and health service provision for people with respiratory illness across Australia and New Zealand. This paper describes the development, plans for implementation and likely outcomes of the ANZRAP.",
