    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Nanotoxicology is a major field of study that reveals hazard effects of nanomaterials on the living cells.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In the present study, Copper/Copper oxide nanoparticles (Cu/CuO NPs) were prepared by the chemical reduction method and characterized by different techniques such as: X-Ray Diffraction, Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Evaluation of the toxicity of Cu/CuO NPs was performed on 2 types of cells: human lung normal cell lines (WI-38) and human lung carcinoma cell (A549). To assess the toxicity of the prepared Cu/CuOs NPs, the two cell types were exposed to Cu/CuO NPs for 72 h. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 of Cu/CuO NPs for both cell types was separately determined and used to examine the cell genotoxicity concurrently with the determination of some oxidative stress parameters: nitric oxide, glutathione reduced, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Cu/CuO NPs suppressed proliferation and viability of normal and carcinoma lung cells. Treatment of both cell types with their IC50's of Cu/CuO NPs resulted in DNA damage besides the generation of reactive oxygen species and consequently the generation of a state of oxidative stress.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overall, it can be concluded that the IC50's of the prepared Cu/CuO NPs were cytotoxic and genotoxic to both normal and cancerous lung cells.",
