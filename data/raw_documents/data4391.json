    "abstract": "In the recent time, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease were recognized for their significant role in the current healthcare because of their growing incidence and costs for health insurance systems. Effective therapy is missing and even etiology of the diseases like Alzheimer disease is not deeply known. In the case of Alzheimer disease, it is probable that oxidative stress is at least a factor involved in the disease. Nevertheless, the current literature is controversial and ambiguous in this matter. This review is focused on mapping the role of oxidative stress as well as on a consideration that oxidative stress represents the pathway at which a therapeutic strategy can be aimed. This paper provides a survey of contemporary literature on oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease and discusses the opportunities for establishing a therapy based on interfering the stress (Fig. 5, Ref. 117).",
