    "abstract": "Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the endogenous antioxidant defense system. Its involvement in cell senescence, apoptosis, and series diseases has been demonstrated. Advances in carcinogenic research have revealed oxidative stress as a pivotal pathophysiological pathway in tumorigenesis and to be involved in lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, leukemia, and so on. This review combs the effects of oxidative stress on tumorigenesis on each phase and cell fate determination, and three features are discussed. Oxidative stress takes part in the processes ranging from tumorigenesis to tumor death via series pathways and processes like mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ferroptosis. It can affect cell fate by engaging in the complex relationships between senescence, death, and cancer. The influence of oxidative stress on tumorigenesis and progression is a multi-stage interlaced process that includes two aspects of promotion and inhibition, with mitochondria as the core of regulation. A deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the effects of oxidative stress on tumorigenesis is conducive to exploring more tumor therapies.",
