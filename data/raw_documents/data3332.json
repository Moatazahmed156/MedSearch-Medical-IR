    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a challenging and complex disorder to manage, and this becomes more difficult when young people are beginning to experience the pleasures and effects of alcohol consumption. For a young person with type 1 diabetes, alcohol consumption can have harmful effects on their current and future wellbeing. The article focuses on the effects of alcohol in type 1 diabetes and the difficulties a young person faces in maintaining glycaemic control when drinking alcohol. The effects of living in an alcohol permissive culture and the knowledge and risks of alcohol consumption, as well as issues associated with depression and denial are discussed. In addition, we aim to raise awareness of best practice guidelines for healthcare professionals to reduce short and long-term complications associated with alcohol-induced hypoglycaemia.",
