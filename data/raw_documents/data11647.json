  "title": "Computed tomography perfusion-defined ischemic core predicts functional outcome after basilar artery thrombectomy.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the optimal threshold for computed tomography perfusion (CTP)-defined ischemic core in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) that predicts functional outcome. A retrospective analysis was conducted on BAO patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy at our stroke center between January 2018 and March 2024. Ischemic core was estimated using following thresholds: cerebral blood flow (CBF) < 10 or 15 mL/100 g/min by Syngo.via, cerebral blood volume < 1.2 mL/100 mL by Syngo.via, and time to maximum (Tmax) > 10 s by RAPID. A favorable functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3 at 90-day post-onset. The Posterior Circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early computed tomography Score (pc-ASPECTS) was semi-quantified to assess ischemic changes. Statistical analysis included intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and receiver operating characteristic analyses. A total of 85 patients were enrolled, and 39 (45.9%) had a favorable functional outcome. The ICC for pc-ASPECTS based on four core approaches between junior and senior observers ranged from 0.90 to 0.96. For the classification of favorable outcome, the volume and pc-ASPECTS core estimation approach (CBF < 10 mL/100 g/min by Syngo.via) had the best performance, with the largest area under the curve of 0.86 [(95% confidence intervals, 0.78-0.94);  In BAO patients following successful recanalization, the volume and pc-ASPECTS core estimation approach (CBF < 10 mL/100 g/min by Syngo.via) demonstrated the strongest predictive value for favorable functional outcomes.",
