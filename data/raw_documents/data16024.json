  "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus that infects pigs of all ages. Notably, neonatal piglets (≤7 days old) in naïve herds can experience case fatality rates approaching 100%, with hallmark clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, thereby representing a major threat to swine herd health. Serum PEDV-specific IgG serves as a key serological marker of vaccine-induced herd immunity. Accordingly, we developed an indirect ELISA (iELISA) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-expressed recombinant PEDV spike (S) protein as the coating antigen. Checkerboard titration identified the optimal antigen-coating concentration and serum dilution as 1 μg/mL and 1:300, respectively. Based on sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios from 50 PEDV-negative sera, the diagnostic cutoff was set at 0.796, corresponding to the mean plus 3 standard deviation (SD) of the negative control group (",
