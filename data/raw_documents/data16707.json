  "abstract": "Early-onset epilepsy in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a major risk factor for neurodevelopmental impairment and drug resistance. This study aims to identify key neuroimaging biomarkers, including tuber brain proportion (TBP) and tuber type, that predict early seizure onset and response to anti-seizure medications (ASMs). In this retrospective study of 306 pediatric TSC patients, we analyzed clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cortical tubers were classified into four imaging-based subtypes. We performed quantitative volumetric and TBP analyses and used univariate and multivariate regression to identify risk factors for early-onset epilepsy (<12 months) and poor ASM outcome (defined as persistent seizures at one year). The cohort had a median seizure onset age of 10 months (IQR: 4-25), with 57.8% (n = 177) classified as early-onset. A majority (66.7%, n = 204) had a poor ASM response. Key imaging features, including higher total TBP, type II/III TBP, and frontal/temporal/parietal lobar TBP, were significantly associated with early onset (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed type II lesion TBP (OR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.15-6.01), cortical calcification burden (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.24-3.24), and subependymal nodule (SEN) count (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25) as independent predictors of early-onset epilepsy. Furthermore, type II lesion volume (p < 0.001) and TBP (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of poor ASM response. Type II tuber burden, cortical calcification, and SEN count are independent neuroimaging predictors of early-onset epilepsy in TSC. The volume and proportion of type II tubers are also critically associated with antiseizure medication resistance, highlighting their clinical utility for prognosis and guiding early intervention strategies.",
