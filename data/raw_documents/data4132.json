    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Interstitial pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy. The aim of our publication is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We report the case of a ruptured interstitial pregnancy diagnosed in a 32 years old patient admitted for acute abdominal pain.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The main symptom was severe pelvic pain in a context of amenorrhea. The ultrasound found the ectopic pregnancy in the form of an eccentric gestational sac with an empty uterine cavity as well as intraperitoneal effusion. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy was suspected and the patient was admitted immediately for emergency laparotomy with cornusotomy and salpingectomy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Interstitial ectopic pregnancy is associated with high morbidity. Its diagnosis and management should be early and adequate in order to avoid complications and preserve fertility.",
