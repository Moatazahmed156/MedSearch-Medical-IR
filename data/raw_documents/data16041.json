  "title": "A Comprehensive View on the Mechanisms of Coronavirus Escaping Innate Immunity.",
  "abstract": "Coronaviruses are a group of widespread infectious pathogens that pose a serious threat to human and animal health. Corona Virus Disease 2019, instigated by severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2, has presented an unprecedented challenge to global public health in recent years. The host innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens, which plays a key role in inhibiting the initial infection of viruses and regulating the initiation and development of acquired immunity. However, coronaviruses can suppress the host's innate immune response through their unique immune escape mechanisms, which is one of the key strategies for coronavirus pathogenesis. This review focuses on the host's innate immune sensors, innate antiviral immune responses, and the mechanisms employed by coronaviruses to evade and suppress the innate immune system. And we hope that it will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the escape mechanism of coronaviruses regarding innate immunity and the pathogenesis of coronaviruses.",
