    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To investigate whether cochlear involvement is an extraintestinal manifestation in patients with ulcerative colitis.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Forty-four ulcerative colitis patients and 44 age-matched healthy subjects were included in the study. Pure tone and speech audiometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emission tests were performed on all participants. The audiometric test results were compared between groups and their relationship with disease activity was investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Pure tone threshold averages were significantly higher in ulcerative colitis patients compared to controls (p 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Even though hearing thresholds may be within normal limits, decreased distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude values indicate a cochlear involvement in ulcerative colitis patients.",
