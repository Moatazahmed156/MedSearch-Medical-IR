  "abstract": "Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was found to play an important role in maintaining tolerance and immune balance, and its mechanism of action on asthma still needs to be further clarified. We aim to block P MATERIAL AND METHODS: in a juvenile asthma model, PD-L1 blockers were used to inhibit the expression of PD-L1 in vivo. By evaluating parameters that reflect airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, tissue damage, intestinal barrier function, and microbiome changes in mice, the impact of PD-L1 blockade on various physiological and immune indicators in asthma models is fully revealed. PD-L1 blockade reduces leukocyte infiltration in the lungs, including eosinophils, decreased levels of IgE and IgG1, and restored Th1/Th2 imbalance by reducing IL-4, IL-13, and GATA-3 while increasing IFN-γ. In addition, PD-L1 blockade significantly decreased levels of IL-17A/F and increased IL-10. Histological analysis of the lungs showed that PD-L1 blockade attenuated airway inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hyperproduction. Further testing showed that the intestinal barrier function was improved after PD-L1 blockade. Mechanistic studies revealed that PD-L1 blockade improved microbiota composition in the lungs and gut, increased Lactobacillus, SCFA, and reduced LPS. As well as induced the downregulation of CD103 PD-L1 blockade alleviated asthmatic airway inflammation by modulating gut and lung microbiota, improving intestinal barrier function, increasing SCFA levels, reducing LPS and CD103",
