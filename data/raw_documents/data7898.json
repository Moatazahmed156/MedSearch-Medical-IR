    "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN) affects one in three adults in the United States and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. There is emerging evidence that more intense blood pressure lowering reduces mortality in patients with kidney disease who are at risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage renal disease. However, the ideal blood pressure threshold for patients with kidney disease remains a question of debate. Novel tools to more precisely diagnose HTN, tailor treatment, and predict the risk of end-organ damage such as kidney disease are needed. Analysis of circulating and urinary extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo (protein and RNA) has the potential to identify novel noninvasive biomarkers that can also reflect a specific pathological mechanism of different HTN phenotypes. We will discuss the use of extracellular vesicles as markers of HTN severity and explain their profile change with antihypertensive medicine and potential to detect early end-organ damage. However, more studies with enhanced rigor in this field are needed to define the blood pressure threshold to prevent or delay kidney disease progression and decrease cardiovascular risk.",
