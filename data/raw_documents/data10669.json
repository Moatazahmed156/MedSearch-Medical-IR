Multivariate logistic or linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between social phobia-related variables and asthma-related variables. Elevated scores on the Mini-SPIN and SASC scales were associated with an increased risk of asthma in adolescents (both  Among adolescents, there was a significant association between social phobia and asthma.",
