  "title": "Sociostructural Determinants of Health for People Living With HIV During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Policy Brief for Future Global Health Crises.",
  "abstract": "The dual pandemics of COVID-19 and HIV have underscored critical gaps in global health policy, particularly regarding disproportionate impacts on people living with HIV, often failing to address sociostructural determinants of health (sSDoH) that fuel inequities. Nurses and other health care practitioners, possessing unique knowledge and technical capacity, are vital in advocating for policy innovations that address the civil and human rights of vulnerable populations. This policy brief, informed by historical health frameworks like the Alma-Ata Declaration and contemporary understandings of sSDoH, proposes three key policy actions to foster health equity. These include integrating HIV and other disease-specific care into Universal Health Coverage frameworks, implementing a sSDoH-oriented emergency preparedness strategy, and fostering partnerships with civil society organizations for community-led policy mechanisms. Adopting these comprehensive, equity-focused approaches, grounded in intersectoral collaboration and community engagement, can improve global health outcomes and civil and human rights, particularly during overlapping pandemics.",
