  "abstract": "Early outcomes of influenza-induced lung injury depend on the rapid activation of the macrophage-type I interferon (IFN) axis, a process that requires tightly regulated glutathione-reactive oxygen species (GSH-ROS) buffering. The aim of this study was to determine whether oral  The public dataset GSE43764 (48 Agilent one-color microarrays) was re-analyzed using ComBat batch correction, limma differential analysis, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) functional scoring, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) co-expression, CIBERSORTx deconvolution, and mixed-effects modeling; all statistics were Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted. In uninfected mice, pulmonary Gclc was significantly upregulated in the B240 group ( B240 elevates baseline GSH-ROS thresholds and reshapes a red co-expression module, synchronously amplifying macrophage infiltration and type I IFN feedback, thereby strengthening early innate responses to H1N1 infection and suggesting nutritional-immunological prophylaxis for high-risk respiratory viral exposure.",
