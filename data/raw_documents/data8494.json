    "abstract": "Interferons are a class of glycoproteins whose properties include antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative effects. Immunotherapy with interferons is used in a variety of diseases, such as haemato-oncological disorders, solid tumours, viral hepatitis and multiple sclerosis. Due to their involvement in the regulation of a large number of physiological functions, many different side effects can occur. Flu-like syndromes, gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, pain, increased susceptibility to infections, thyroid dysfunction and psychiatric side effects occur frequently with alfa-interferon. Side effects frequently necessitate interruption and dose reduction. Severe or even life-threatening side effects are not frequent but do occur. Patient education is an important promotor of patient compliance, as are proper detection and symptomatic treatment of the side effects.",
