    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer lacks clear syndromes at an early stage and could result in serious problem in woman's health status. The current diagnostic approach relies on physical examination, ultrasound examination, and blood test for CA125. These approaches could not diagnose early stage ovarian cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. The present paper reviewed the efforts in screening the proteomic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The sources of biomarkers were discussed. Then, the current techniques in proteomics were introduced. Finally, the biomarkers for ovarian cancer were summarized.",
