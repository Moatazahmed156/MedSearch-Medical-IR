    "abstract": "Chickens are excellent models for the study of retinal development and function. Gene expression at the correct time is crucial to retinal development and function. The present study aimed to investigate retinal gene expression and morphology in locally grown chickens at various developmental stages. RNA was extracted from the retina at the embryonic and post-hatch stages, and the retinal layers were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were used for gene expression analysis of 14 selected genes. The results showed that all the retinal genes were expressed at different developmental stages. However, there were slight noticeable variations in expression patterns. At the morphological level, all retinal layers were well observed, except for the outer plexiform layer that became visible in the fifteen-day chick embryo. The current study provides a baseline for standard retinal gene expression of 14 genes and retinal histological staining. The selected genes have different roles in retinal development and function, and most of these genes are associated with retinal diseases. The results obtained here can be applied to molecular retinal research and retinal diseases with genetic factors in retina animal models or human diseases.",
