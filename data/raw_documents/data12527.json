  "title": "Complications and length of stay after enhanced recovery after surgery compared to conventional care in colorectal cancer patients in Northern Italy.",
  "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate postoperative complications and length of stay in colorectal cancer patients undergoing ERAS vs. non-ERAS procedures in a population-based cohort in northern Italy. Patient characteristics (ASA, tumor site, stage, treatment, BMI) were used. Complications, stratified by Clavien-Dindo and length of stay (LOS), were reported. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the difference between ERAS and non-ERAS patients. A total of 319 patients were included, divided into the non-ERAS group (113 patients) and the ERAS group (206 patients). Non-ERAS vs. ERAS group showed more complications (16.8% vs. 13.6%;  ERAS procedures appear to be able to allow intervention even in older patients and those with comorbidities, without compromising the results.",
