  "title": "Comparative analysis of changes in pediatric burn epidemiology between national burn registry and regional burn center data during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused major societal disruptions, including shifts in childcare, remote learning, and parental work-from-home responsibilities, potentially altering pediatric burn incidence. This study compares pediatric burn admission numbers, etiology, and severity at a regional burn center to national trends before and during the pandemic. A retrospective cohort study analyzed pediatric burn admissions and reported their proportion of total burns from a regional burn center and the American Burn Association National Burn Repository (2017-2022). Patient demographics, burn etiology, and total body surface area burned were examined. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression assessed differences between pre-pandemic (2017-2019) and pandemic (2020-2022) cohorts. Among 618 pediatric burn patients, regional admissions increased by 26 % in 2020, whereas national data demonstrated a 41 % decline. Thermal burns remained the most common etiology, though non-thermal burns increased. Burn admissions rose in infants (<1 year) and school-aged children (5-18 years) but declined in toddlers (1-5 years). Older pediatric age (p = 0.03) and thermal burns (p < 0.01) were significant risk factors. Regional pediatric burn admissions rose during the pandemic despite a national decline, underscoring the need for targeted prevention strategies and improved burn center preparedness for future public health crises.",
