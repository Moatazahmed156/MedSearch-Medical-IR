  "title": "Estimating the global macroeconomic impact of Tuberculosis among children and adolescents.",
  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge. Understanding the economic burden of TB in adolescents is crucial for policy-making, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. This study utilized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 to estimate the economic impact of TB among adolescents (under 20 years of age) globally and regionally. DALYs were monetized into Value of a Statistical Life Year (VSLY) using the VSLY framework, and macroeconomic data, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (Purchasing Power Parity, PPP. Constant 2021 international dollars) from the World Bank, were incorporated. The primary outcome was the total economic burden of TB, expressed as the Value of Lost Welfare (VLW) . In 2021, the global economic burden of TB among adolescents was estimated at $262.98 billion (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 198.14, 350.17), or 0.17% of global GDP (95% UI: 0.13, 0.23). The burden was high in low- and lower-middle-income regions, with VLW in low-middle Sociodemographic index (SDI) regions reaching $153.92 billion (2.22% of GDP). In sub-Saharan Africa, VLW was $114.40 billion (2.37% of GDP). In contrast, high-income regions such as North America and Western Europe had much low VLWs (less than 0.01% of GDP). Thirteen countries had VLWs exceeding $5.00 billion, with India having the highest at $82.49 billion. The study highlight significant regional disparities, with particularly high burdens in low- and middle-income regions. It emphasize the need for targeted investments in TB control in these areas.",
