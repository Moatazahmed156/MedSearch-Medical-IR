    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for COVID-19, has raised the interest for infection-associated muco-cutaneous symptoms. While dermatologic symptoms in general gained an increasing awareness, affection of the nail organ has been mentioned only recently. We provide a narrative review on COVID-19 manifestation on the nail organ and add symptoms induced by personal protective measures and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Available treatment options are discussed.",
