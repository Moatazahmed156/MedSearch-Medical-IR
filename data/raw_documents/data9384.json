  "title": "Urinary nephrin - An emerging novel biomarker in early detection of diabetic nephropathy: A review.",
  "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy is a microvascular complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by persistent albuminuria, hypertension and a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate. Early detection of diabetic nephropathy is crucial for the management of complications. Urinary Nephrin is an emerging biomarker that has been implicated in early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Nephrin is a podocyte-specific protein that maintains glomerular filtration barrier integrity. Alterations in Nephrin expression and urinary excretion are signs of renal impairment in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, it is of interest to establish a biological reference interval and standardize the assay method. Hence, an update on this emerging biomarker is relevant.",
