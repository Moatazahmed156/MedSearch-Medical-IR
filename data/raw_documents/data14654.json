  "title": "The Effect of Periodontal Therapy on Renal Function and Diabetes Control in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease. A Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial.",
  "abstract": "To investigate the effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on renal function and glycaemic control in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients over a 6-month observation period, through a randomised clinical trial (RCT). A total of 53 patients participated: 27 in the intervention group (IG) and 26 in the control group (CG). Outcomes included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using serum creatinine or both serum creatinine and cystatin-C), urine albumin to urine creatinine ratio (uACR) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Glycaemic control was assessed using HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Intra-group ΔeGFR levels were 10.26 mL/min/1.73 m Despite its limitations, this RCT shows that NSPT enhances renal function-increasing eGFR and decreasing hsCRP-and improves glycaemic control in CKD patients with DM.",
