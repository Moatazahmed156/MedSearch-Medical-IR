    "abstract": "Patients with head and neck cancer experience many problems with eating which make them at high risk of malnutrition. Pre-habilitation swallowing exercises as overseen by a speech pathologist can improve swallowing function. A multidisciplinary approach to care, including effective nutritional screening, assessment and intervention has demonstrated improved outcomes in terms of meet nutritional requirements, improved nutritional status and quality of life. Nutritional recommendations are 1.2-1.5 g protein per kilogram per day and 125kJ/kg body weight per day but as these are guides close monitoring of intake and weight is important. Multidisciplinary teams and telehealth have shown better outcomes for nutrition and swallowing status for head and neck cancer patients and ongoing support is required for best patient care.",
