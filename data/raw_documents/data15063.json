  "title": "Direct-acting antiviral therapy reduces variceal rebleeding and improves liver function in hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major public health issue in Egypt, with a high prevalence of genotype 4. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieve > 95% sustained virologic response (SVR), but their impact on variceal rebleeding in genotype 4 cirrhotic patients is underexplored. This study evaluated the association between DAA therapy and variceal rebleeding in Egyptian patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. To evaluate the association between DAA therapy and variceal rebleeding in Egyptian patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. A multicenter retrospective cohort study included HCV genotype 4 cirrhotic patients from five Egyptian centers with a first variceal bleeding episode. Patients were divided into DAA-treated (Group A) and non-treated (Group B) groups and followed for 5 years. Propensity score matching (PSM), Cox regression, and competing risk analysis were adjusted for confounders. DAA treatment significantly reduced variceal rebleeding (HR 2.57; 95%CI: 1.39-4.72;  DAA treatment in HCV-related cirrhosis significantly reduces variceal rebleeding, ascites development, and hepatic dysfunction progression. The 5-year follow-up data demonstrate sustained improvements in liver function and hematologic parameters, underscoring the long-term benefits of DAA therapy.",
