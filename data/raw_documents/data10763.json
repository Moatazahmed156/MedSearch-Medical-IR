  "title": "Protectin D1 and maresin 1 attenuate airway hyperreactivity induced by IL-13 in human isolated small bronchi.",
  "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-13 is implicated in airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a key feature of asthma. We explored the potential anti-AHR activity of selected specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in IL-13-induced AHR models, using human bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) and human isolated bronchi. Calcium flux responses induced by histamine or LTD In BSMCs, exposure to IL-13 increased calcium flux (E This new anti-hyperreactive action of PD1 and MaR1 encourages further research into their potential as therapies for the treatment of airway hyperreactivity.",
