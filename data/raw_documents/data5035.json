    "abstract": "Locally advanced prostate cancer is regarded as a very high-risk disease with a poor prognosis. Although there is no definitive consensus on the definition of locally advanced prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer as a primary treatment or part of a multimodal therapy has been reported. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is currently carried out even in high-risk prostate cancer because it provides optimal outcomes. However, limited studies have assessed the role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Herein, we summarize and review the current knowledge in terms of the definition and surgical indications of locally advanced prostate cancer, and the surgical procedure and perisurgical/oncological outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer.",
