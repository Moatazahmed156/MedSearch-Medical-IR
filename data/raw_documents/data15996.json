  "abstract": "To explore the mechanism of action of azithromycin on lung oxidative injury and immune function in mice infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) based on the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling pathway. The lung index, dry/wet weight ratio, inflammatory factor levels in alveolar lavage fluid, serum contents of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), oxidative stress markers, peripheral blood levels of T-lymphocyte subsets, pathological changes, and Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 expression were assessed. Compared to the control group, the MP group exhibited elevated lung index, reduced lung dry/wet weight ratio, elevated tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 contents, reduced IL-10 levels, raised IFN-γ, IgG and peripheral blood CD8 Azithromycin ameliorates MP infection-induced lung injury and oxidative stress and strengthens immune function in mice, which may be achieved by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.",
