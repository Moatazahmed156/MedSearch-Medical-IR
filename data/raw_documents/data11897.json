  "title": "Development of a Label-Free Fluorescence Strategy for Sensitive and Site-Specific Measurement of RNA Inosine Modification in Breast Tissues.",
  "abstract": "Inosine (I) is an inert purine nucleoside that exerts critical regulatory effects on RNA maturation, alternative splicing, and translational fidelity. Dysregulation of inosine modifications has been tightly associated with the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases including neurological conditions, autoimmune diseases, and tumorigenesis. Herein, we propose a label-free fluorescence strategy based on cyanoethylation-induced elongation arrest and an exonuclease I-catalyzed digestion reaction for sensitive and site-specific detection of RNA inosine modification in human cell lines and breast tissues. In this assay, target inosine in RNA (I-RNA) can be selectively cyanoethylated with acrylonitrile to form an ",
