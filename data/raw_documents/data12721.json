  "abstract": "Cyanine dyes (Cy) possess excellent properties for biomedical applications, but their effectiveness is hampered by disordered aqueous aggregation and photophysical instability. To address these challenges, we rationally engineer the heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) scaffold by integrating tetraphenylethylene (TPE)─a rigid π-conjugated hydrophobic moiety─and tumor-targeting mannose, a hydrophilic glycan that recognizes overexpressed mannose receptors (MR) on cancer cells. This molecular design enables spontaneous self-assembly, driven by hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions, into well-defined, carrier-free nanoparticles (TCM NPs). TCM NPs serve as an immunogenically safe, multifunctional nanoplatform that integrates MR-targeted delivery, near-infrared (NIR) imaging, and dual phototherapy. Mechanistically, the twisted conformation of TPE introduces steric hindrance, effectively suppressing intramolecular π-π stacking and fluorescence quenching while enhancing nonradiative decay, resulting in a remarkable 58.6% photothermal conversion efficiency. Simultaneously, the excited state of TCM facilitates efficient S",
