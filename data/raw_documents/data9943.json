  "title": "The relationship between preoperative pulmonary hypertension risk in liver transplant and vascular and biliary complications in the postoperative period.",
  "abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) is the gold standard definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). In patients with ESLD, preoperative pulmonary hypertension (PHT) secondary to the primary liver pathology is a common complication that causes high mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to determine whether thrombosis, hemorrhage, stenosis, occlusion, and biliary system complications may be indirectly affected by this vascular complication. This study retrospectively screened patients undergoing LT at our hospital between 2017 and 2024. A total of 265 patients were included in this study, and PHT in the grafts, as well as vascular and biliary pathologies, were identified in all archived computed tomography scans of these patients. The portal vein complications in the PHT group (17.5%) were higher than those in the non-PHT group (9.4%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis examining the relationship between PHT level and complications, a significant association with portal vein complications was found. No difference was found between the two groups regarding hepatic vein complications ( Moderate-to-severe PHT levels were found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of portal vein complications. We believe caution is warranted, as the presence of preoperative PHT can significantly increase the risk of post-LT complications. Changes in mediator balance in PHT lead to systemic vascular remodeling and, consequently, systemic vasoconstriction. We believe that this condition may negatively affect graft vascularity in patients undergoing LT, thereby increasing vascular and biliary complications. This study found that PHT is associated with the risk of portal vein complications.",
