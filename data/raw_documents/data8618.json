    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a newly discovered cell death type which is different from apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis as well as necrosis in the following aspects: morphology, biochemistry, gene and regulatory mechanisms. Ferroptosis is regulated by multiples of mechanisms such as system Xc- mechanism, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mechanism, iron metabolism and lipid metabolism. Currently, ferroptosis has been revealed to be significant in wound healing such as diabetic wound, irradiated wound and ultraviolet (UV)-driven wound. Hence, how to intervene in the pathogenesis as well as the development of wounds and promote the wound healing by the regulation of ferroptosis have become a research hotspot. This review systematically summarises the latest scientific advances of ferroptosis and wound healing fields, with hoping to propose a new insight and advance in the wound treatment.",
