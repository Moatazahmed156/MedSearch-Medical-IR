  "title": "Food insecurity patterns and mental health among youth and young adults with diabetes.",
  "abstract": "Food insecurity (FI) is linked to mental health outcomes cross-sectionally, but little is known about temporal patterns of FI and changes in mental health. FI can exacerbate the mental health challenges of managing diabetes, creating a vicious cycle that worsens youth and young adults' (YYAs) mental well-being. We investigated the association of temporal patterns of FI with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, and changes therein in YYAs with youth-onset type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Longitudinal data (2016-2022) including three time points (t Among YYAs with T1D and T2D, 6.6% and 16.5% were PFI, 20.3% and 42.3% were IFI, respectively. In YYA with T1D, PFI and IFI were associated with greater depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms at t The study identified a previously unrecognized link between prolonged exposure to FI and increased incidence of mental health issues. Both persistent and intermittent FI were associated with adverse mental health symptoms in YYA with diabetes, more so for those with PFI. Subsequent research should prioritize interventions that address FI in this population to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing both physical and psychological well-being. It should be designed to not only address FI, but also comprehensive support, including mental health services and education.",
