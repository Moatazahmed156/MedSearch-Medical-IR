  "abstract": "Dysregulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is a hallmark biological feature of cancer cells, which hijack pHi homeostasis to sustain malignant phenotypes including uncontrolled proliferation, invasion, and metabolic reprogramming. Meanwhile, alkaliptosis, a newly defined pH-dependent form of regulated cell death specifically triggered by the small-molecule compound JTC-801, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer intervention. However, reliable tools for monitoring dynamic pHi changes during alkaliptosis remain insufficient. RpHluorin2 is an optimized ratiometric pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein variant with enhanced fluorescence intensity and stability. Herein, we established a stable RpHluorin2-expressing cell line and further developed a multi-dimensional fluorescence detection workflow, which encompasses a microplate reader, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, a small animal imaging system (IVIS Spectrum), and a protein dot blot assay coupled with IVIS. Our results demonstrated a strong linear correlation between RpHluorin2 fluorescence intensity and cell number, with a coefficient of determination (",
