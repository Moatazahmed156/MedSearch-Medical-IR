    "abstract": "More than 70% of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections are related to urinary catheters, which are commonly used for the treatment of about 20% of hospitalized patients. Urinary catheters are used to drain the bladder if there is an obstruction in the tube that carries urine out of the bladder (urethra). During catheter-associated urinary tract infections, microorganisms rise up in the urinary tract and reach the bladder, and cause infections. Various materials are used to fabricate urinary catheters such as silicone, polyurethane, and latex. These materials allow bacteria and fungi to develop colonies on their inner and outer surfaces, leading to bacteriuria or other infections. Urinary catheters could be modified to exert antibacterial and antifungal effects. Although so many research have been conducted over the past years on the fabrication of antibacterial and antifouling catheters, an ideal catheter needs to be developed for long-term catheterization of more than a month. In this review, we are going to introduce the recent advances in fabricating antibacterial materials to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections, such as nanoparticles, antibiotics, chemical compounds, antimicrobial peptides, bacteriophages, and plant extracts.",
