    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Studies on dressings frequently measure wound healing to demonstrate performance. Knowledge of existing methodologies available for wound healing assessment, including their advantages and limitations, is paramount when evaluating the literature on dressings.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      Medline and Cochrane databases were searched for wound healing assessment methodologies used in research or in clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-nine methodologies were identified and classified into 8 categories: scales (n = 4), one-dimensional measurements (n = 2), area measurements (n = 4), volume measurements (n = 6), 3-dimensional wound reproduction systems (n = 5), methodologies based on wound physical characteristics (n = 3), rates and surrogates end point calculated from variation in wound dimensions (n = 4), and time to wound healing (n = 1). The main problems encountered during wound healing assessment include the following: boundary definition, assessor's contact with the wound, irregular wound shape, and difficulty in evaluating early healing.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      At this time, an ideal methodology does not exist. Research in this area is lacking and should be the focus in wound healing evaluation.",
