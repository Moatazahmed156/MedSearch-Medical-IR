  "abstract": "Combining chemotherapy with chemosensitizing agents is a common strategy to enhance anticancer efficacy while mitigating treatment-related side effects. This study investigated the potential of dammarenediol II (DM2), a ginsenoside precursor, to enhance the anticancer effects of etoposide by downregulating O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) and modulating the Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 human liver cancer cells. The effect of DM2 on O-GlcNAcylation regulation was analyzed using Pharmaco-Net, an artificial intelligence-driven drug screening platform and further validated using O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) activity assay. DM2 cotreatment enhanced etoposide's anticancer efficacy, which was quantitatively evaluated by viability, Annexin V binding, membrane integrity, and caspase-3/7 activity assays in HepG2 cells. Results showed that DM2 reduced O-GlcNAc levels by directly interacting with OGT, as confirmed through Pharmaco-Net. Cotreatment with 40 μm DM2 and 20 μm etoposide produced synergistic anticancer effects, lowering etoposide's IC",
