  "abstract": "People with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) remain at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even after hepatitis C virus (HCV) sustained virological response (HCV-SVR). To evaluate transient elastography and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index as prognostic markers for HCC after HCV-SVR. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from people with cALCD and HCV-SVR. cALCD was defined as baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 10 kPa. The primary outcome was the occurrence of HCC. Data collected at baseline (pre-treatment) and 1 year after the end of treatment (1-year-EOT) of LSM, FIB-4 index, and laboratory results were analyzed. LSM and FIB-4 index were evaluated as independent predictors of HCC by a Cox regression analysis. Receiver operator characteristic curves, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression analysis were performed. Total of 425 patients (65.2% female; mean age = 62 ± 10 years) were included. The median pre-treatment and 1-year-EOT LSM were respectively 15.0 kPa (interquartile range: 11.8-23.2) and 12 kPa (interquartile range: 7.9-19.9) ( In cACLD-HCV SVR patients, pre-treatment or 1-year-EOT LSM ≥ 20 kPa and FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 but not their delta was associated with HCC. A single measure of LSM ≥ 20 kPa or FIB-4 ≥ 3.25, either pre-treatment or 1-year-EOT, would be necessary to predict the incidence of HCC in people with HCV-SVR.",
