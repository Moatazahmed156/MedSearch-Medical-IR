    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury results in dramatic disturbances of motor, sensory and autonomic function. Every aspect of a child's life is significantly and usually irreversibly altered. As a condition with low incidence and protean manifestations, the acute care and rehabilitation of spinal cord injured children requires the specialized care, knowledge and experience of a multidisciplinary team found in regional centers. Functional outcome depends on the level and completeness of the spinal cord injury, comprehensive training and education, and the skillful prescription of adaptive technology and aids. Long-term care and management by rehabilitation personnel in concert with the primary care pediatrician will ensure the maintenance of functional independence and general health.",
