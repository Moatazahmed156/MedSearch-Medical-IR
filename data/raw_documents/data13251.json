  "title": "Feasibility randomized controlled trial of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to reduce falls in Parkinson's disease.",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) significantly impairs mobility and increases the risk of falls. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a randomized controlled trial protocol investigating the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with gait training. Twenty-five individuals with PD were assessed for eligibility to participate in either active tDCS walking training (experimental group) or sham tDCS walking training (control group) for 4 weeks, consisting of 12 30-minute sessions. Of the 25 individuals assessed, 11 met the eligibility criteria (44%), and 9 were enrolled in the study (36% of eligible, 22.5% of total). Adherence to the intervention was high (88.9%), and no serious adverse events were reported. The protocol was found to be safe and feasible, though methodological adjustments, particularly in eligibility criteria and logistical procedures, are recommended to improve future implementation. These findings support the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the combined effects of tDCS and gait training in individuals with PD.",
