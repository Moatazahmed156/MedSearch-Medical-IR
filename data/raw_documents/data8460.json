    "abstract": "Antipsychotics are associated with significant weight gain and other metabolic side effects. There are, however, substantial differences in their propensity for causing metabolic side effects as summarised in this review. These differences are important to consider when deciding which antipsychotic to use. Given the risk of metabolic side effects, patients should be closely monitored regarding anthropometric measures and metabolic parameters. Moreover, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions should be considered for treatment of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.",
