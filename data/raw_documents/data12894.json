  "title": "Therapeutic Potential for Cannabidiol on Alzheimer's Disease-Related Neuroinflammation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chronic neuroinflammation; current interventions primarily offer symptomatic relief. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, exhibits multi-target therapeutic potential due to its established anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. While growing interest exists, the evidence regarding CBD's effects on AD-related neuroinflammation has not been robustly consolidated in a quantitative meta-analysis. Therefore, this article reviews the current literature around CBD related to its potential in alleviating neuroinflammation, followed by a meta-analysis of preclinical and clinical studies using random-effects modeling to assess CBD efficacy on neuroinflammation and clinical outcomes in AD. In preclinical AD models, the meta-analysis demonstrated that CBD significantly and consistently reduced key markers of neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis, specifically glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (",
