  "title": "Therapeutic Potential of the β3-Adrenergic Receptor and Its Ligands in Cardiovascular Diseases.",
  "abstract": "The β3-adrenergic receptor is an exceptional member of the β-adrenergic receptor family. Recent findings suggest that it may play a more significant role in the cardiovascular system than previously recognized, partly through its potential anti-inflammatory actions. For this reason, it has been extensively studied as a potential target in cardiovascular therapy. In this review, we focus on the β3-adrenergic receptor agonists and their pharmacodynamics regarding receptor binding and activation. We then describe the mechanisms of action mediated by the β3-adrenergic receptor in blood vessels and in the heart under both physiological and pathological conditions. We particularly concentrate on the therapeutic potential in the arterial, pulmonary, and portal hypertension as well as cardiac arrhythmias, ischemia, and heart failure, considering both receptor agonism and antagonism.",
