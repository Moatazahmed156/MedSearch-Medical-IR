    "abstract": "Human endogenous retrovirus-H long terminal repeat-associating 2 (HHLA2) is a newly emerging immune checkpoint that belongs to B7 family. HHLA2 has a co-stimulatory receptor transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 2 (TMIGD2) and a newly discovered co-inhibitory receptor killer cell Ig-like receptor, three Ig domains, and long cytoplasmic tail (KIR3DL3), which endows it with both immunostimulant and immunosuppression functions in cancer development. In this review, we summarize the HHLA2 expression profile in human cancers, its association with cancer prognosis and clinical features, and its dual roles in regulating cancer immune response through up-to-date literatures. Furthermore, we highlight that precision cancer immunotherapy through manipulating HHLA2-KIR3DL3/TMIGD2 interaction is a promising antitumour strategy.",
