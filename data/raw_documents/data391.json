    "abstract": "Smoking during pregnancy is a serious public health concern due to its adverse consequences on fetal development and pregnant women's health. For the success of smoking cessation interventions, it is essential to determine why pregnant women continue smoking. The objective of this study is to determine the beliefs, attitudes, and barriers to quitting smoking during pregnancy. We adopted a qualitative research design. The participants consisted of 22 pregnant women who smoke, selected by purposive sampling. We collected data through semi-structured interviews and analyzed it using thematic analysis. We identified six themes namely \"Reasons for starting to smoke: family and social environment,\" \"Intention to quit smoking and related factors,\" \"Smoking and emotional well-being,\" \"Smoking and stressful life experiences,\" \"Protective thoughts: reducing smoking to safeguard their babies,\" and \"Belief in a healthy pregnancy and inadequate risk perception.\" Women expressed the desire to protect their fetus from the harm of smoking. However, they continued to smoke due to a lack of knowledge, inadequate risk perception, psychological difficulties, and lack of motivation. Health professionals should be aware of the difficulties experienced by pregnant women who smoke and should support them in quitting smoking.",
