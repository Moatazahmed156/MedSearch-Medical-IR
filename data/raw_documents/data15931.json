  "title": "Recombinant Bacillus subtilis spores expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induced humoral, mucosal, and cellular immunity in mice.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected global health and economies. While vaccines have helped reduce mortality from the disease, the inability to prevent its transmission hinders full eradication. Mucosal vaccines capable of preventing virus transmission, hence, are urgently needed. A possible approach involves using Bacillus subtilis, a safe Gram-positive bacterium, as a bacterial spore vaccine delivery platform. Using this approach, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is engineered to be expressed in B. subtilis during bacterial sporulation. The recombinant bacterial spores, when used to immunize Balb/c mice, triggered significant immune responses. Two weeks after the second dose, mice showed elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgM, IgG, and sIgA. The immunization also boosted CD4",
