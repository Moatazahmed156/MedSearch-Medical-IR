    "abstract": "With the worldwide acceptance of mechanically assisted, ultrasound guided thin needle biopsy of the prostate gland, prostate fine needle aspiration (FNA) has fallen out of favor with both urologists and cytopathologists. Nonetheless, given today's trend to submit from 12 to 18 core biopsies per patient, prostate FNA remains less expensive, more expedient and more economical than any other sampling method so far developed. This short overview presents prostate FNA as a sensitive, specific and reliable diagnostic modality that should not be dismissed, as an anachronism, from the diagnostic armamentarium of either the urologist or the pathologist.",
