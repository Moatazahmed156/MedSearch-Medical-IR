  "abstract": "Background The risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) following administration of contemporary gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is thought to be low; however, existing reports have involved relatively few participants compared with the number of patients who might benefit from contrast-enhanced MRI in the United States. Purpose To estimate the risk of NSF with contemporary GBCAs in real-world practice in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD. Materials and Methods Adult patients with preexisting diagnoses of stage 4 or 5 CKD or ESRD who received GBCAs between January 2010 and January 2025 were identified retrospectively from the TriNetX U.S. Network. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a control group regarding demographic characteristics and comorbidities was performed to reduce confounding. The primary endpoint (possible NSF [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, code L90.8]) and secondary endpoint (possible NSF confounders) were assessed within 1 year. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated to assess the occurrence and mortality rates of possible NSF, and the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test was used to compare cumulative occurrence rates. Results A total of 73 022 adults (mean age, 64.1 years ± 15.1 [SD]; 39 359 [53.9%] male) with advanced CKD or ESRD who received GBCAs were identified. After PSM, 36 (0.05%) and 542 (0.74%) patients with advanced CKD or ESRD with possible NSF and NSF confounder codes, respectively, were retained, compared with 36 (0.05%) and 518 (0.71%) in controls, respectively (RR, 1.00 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.59] [",
