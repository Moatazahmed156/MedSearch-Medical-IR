  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains endemic in Oman, with incidence exceeding 5 per 10⁵ population since 2016 and a rising proportion of cases among expatriates (> 40% of the population). This study investigated the spatiotemporal diversity and structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in Oman between 2008 and 2022. A total of 735 MTB isolates from nationals and expatriates across provinces were genotyped by spoligotyping and 17-locus MIRU-VNTR; 96 underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity, h) and differentiation (FST) were estimated, and phylogenetic analyses performed. Four major lineages and seven sub-lineages were identified, with similar distributions between nationals and expatriates but temporal variation in spoligotype clades. MIRU-VNTR showed high allelic diversity, with most dominant alleles (76.5%) stable over time, though 32.5% fluctuated. F",
