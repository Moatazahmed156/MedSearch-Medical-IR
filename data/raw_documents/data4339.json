    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an unbalanced condition in which the tissues of the body are not sufficiently able to counteract either exogenous or endogenous sources of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is strongly associated with ageing, both local and systemic, as well as a wide range of local health conditions. This review focuses on the oxidative stress data known for skin, scalp and hair. This oxidative stress may be the 'currency' by which an unhealthy scalp leads to deleterious consequences to the hair. The ramifications of this scalp oxidative stress to normal hair elongation, retention and replacement are discussed.",
