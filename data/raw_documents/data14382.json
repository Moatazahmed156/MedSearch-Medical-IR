  "abstract": "To evaluate the prognostic role of serum albumin level in the radiological progression of gonarthrosis. Two hundered and fifty patients with gonarthrosis (Group1: early stage gonarthrosis, Group 2: late-stage gonarthrosis), and 125 patients as a control group (Group 3) were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Age, gender, the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) stage, serum albumin level, C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin, platelet/lymphocyte, neutrophil/lymphocyte, lymphocyte/monocyte, lymphocyte/CRP, The Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation, Systemic Inflammatory Response Index, Systemic Immune Inflammation Index, Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Modified Systemic Inflammation Score (mSIS) were recorded. Albumin and PNI were lower compared to the Group 3 in the Group 1 and Group 2, and compared to the Group 1 in the Group 2 (for all  Serum albumin level has a prognostic role in the radiological progression of gonarthrosis.",
