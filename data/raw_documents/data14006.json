  "title": "Recent Advances in Biomimetic Drug Delivery for Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment.",
  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects approximately 1% of the global population, causing debilitating joint pain and often leading to severe disability. Although conventional treatments can control the initial symptoms of RA, there is no curative treatment strategy for RA. Biomimetic nanomedicine has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, leveraging the integration of nanoparticles with natural biomaterials to achieve targeted drug delivery and improved treatment outcomes. Beyond exogenous nano-delivery systems, the natural biomimetic strategy might offer superior biocompatibility and lower immunogenicity. This review summarizes the latest advancements in biomimetic drug delivery systems for RA and highlights the underlying mechanisms for these biomimetic carriers. We also discuss the critical factors influencing the transition of these biomimetic nanomedicines from laboratory research to clinical implementation. By emphasizing the transformative potential of biomimetic strategies in RA treatment, this review aims to provide new insights and directions for future research and clinical applications in this field.",
