    "abstract": "The current study investigated pregnant women's use of pregnancy applications (apps) and how these apps affect their mental health. A questionnaire was administered in the outpatient obstetrics and gynecology department at a university hospital. Of 110 pregnant women included in the analysis, 97 had downloaded and used pregnancy apps and believed that these were either helpful or a little helpful. Among the 110 respondents, 20 (18.2%) women were identified as having psychological distress. Thus, the percentage of women with psychological distress who downloaded pregnancy apps was significantly lower than women in the mentally healthy group. Non-use of pregnancy apps was strongly associated with psychological distress, indicating that pregnancy apps improve pregnant women's mental health. Alternatively, non-use of apps could arise from deteriorated mental health, causing reduced energy or inclination to use these apps. Screening for good mental health among pregnant women is important; non-use of pregnancy apps may indicate risk of mental health deterioration among pregnant women.
