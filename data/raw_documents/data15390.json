  "abstract": "Mycobacteria are rare causes of blood stream infections (BSI). Mycobacterial BSI is associated with a significantly increased risk of early death compared with other bacterial blood infectious diseases. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate of different Mycobacteria BSI remain unclear. A retrospective study of patients with positive mycobacterial blood cultures hospitalized between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2023, at Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, a 1500-bed tertiary university-affiliated hospital in southern China, was performed. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate of patients with different Mycobacteria BSI were reviewed and analyzed.

Of the 41 participants, 37 (90.2 %) were newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. 7 (17.1 %) BSI was caused by  The mortality rate of patients with mycobacterial BSI is high. Mycobacterial BSI occur mostly in severely ill patients with HIV/AIDS. TB-BSI was associated with a higher mortality rate compared to NTM-BSI.",
