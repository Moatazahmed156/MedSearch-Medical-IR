    "abstract": "Herpes zoster is a rare, usually benign disease in children, only requiring symptomatic treatment. Antivirals are used under exceptional circumstances in patients with complex forms of herpes zoster, usually affecting immunocompromised persons, or with ophthalmic involvement. In newborns, it is more often due to intrauterine contamination during maternal varicella. We report two cases of herpes zoster in immunocompetent children. The first case involves a newborn while the second a 7-year old child.",
