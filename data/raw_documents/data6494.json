    "abstract": "In recent years, more and more drugs have been used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, but the efficacy of monotherapy is limited, especially for patients with refractory moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Combination therapy is mainly used for patients with a poor response or partial efficacy of monotherapy and has become a new direction for exploring the treatment strategy of ulcerative colitis. Therefore, the authors review the combined treatment options of ulcerative colitis in the context of the existing literature and discuss considerations for the practical application of combination therapy, hoping to provide new ideas for clinicians in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.",
