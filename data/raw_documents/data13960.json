  "title": "Systemic Associations With Signs, Symptoms, and Their Discordance in an Indian Population With Dry Eye Disease.",
  "abstract": "To identify systemic conditions associated with dry eye disease (DED) symptoms, signs, and their discordance in a clinically diagnosed DED cohort. In this prospective cross-sectional study, participants with DED were assessed for systemic conditions through self-reported history, health records, and specialist referrals. Dry eye disease symptom and sign scores were transformed to a 0 to 1 scale using linear transformation. A discord score (symptom score-sign score) was calculated. Associations between systemic conditions and DED parameters were analyzed using linear regression. The study included 371 DED participants (mean age: 52.9±14.0 years; 226 women). No significant correlation was observed between signs and symptoms (Spearman rho = -0.08; P=0.08). Increasing age (β = -0.005; P<0.001) and longer DED duration (β = -0.003; P<0.001) were associated with higher signs than symptoms. Atopy, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, psychological disorders, and hormonal replacement therapy use were associated with more severe DED symptoms than signs (all P≤0.03). Female sex, graft-versus-host disease, Sjögren disease, and rheumatoid arthritis were associated with more severe DED signs and a symptom-sign discordance (all P≤0.04). Systemic conditions significantly affect how DED presents and may cause symptom-sign mismatch, highlighting the need for thorough systemic history and evaluation in DED.",
