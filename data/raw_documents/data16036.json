  "title": "A Review of Receptor Recognition Mechanisms in Coronaviruses.",
  "abstract": "Cellular receptor recognition exerts fundamental roles during coronavirus infection. Clarifying the regulatory mechanism of virus receptor helps to better understand viral infection, transmission and pathogenesis; predict potential host and how viral escape from immune system; prevent coronavirus infection or develop treatment therapy. Herein, we summarize current understanding of host receptor recognition mechanisms in the different genera of coronavirus family. And we also review diverse methodologies of identification and clarification of virus receptors. The integration of structural biology, multi-omics, computational predictions, synthetic biology and artificially engineered viral receptors, provide a powerful framework for elucidating coronavirus-receptor interactions. This also supports the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, smart biosensors, and intervention strategies against emerging coronaviruses.",
