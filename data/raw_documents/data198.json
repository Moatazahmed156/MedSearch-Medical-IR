    "abstract": "Aims:\n        \n      \n      To investigate loneliness, depression and sleep quality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) and to examine the mediating role of depression between loneliness and sleep quality among this group of patients with T2DM.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A group of T2DM patients was recruited from a tertiary hospital affiliated with a university in Wuhu City, Anhui Province from May to October 2021 by convenient sampling. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modelling were used for data analysis in this study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The direct effect of loneliness on sleep quality was not statistically significant, but the indirect effect of depression on sleep quality was statistically significant. Depression mediated the relationship between loneliness and sleep quality. Depression can affect emotional health and reduce sleep quality. We should reduce the loneliness of patients, prevent the occurrence of depression and improve the quality of sleep.",
