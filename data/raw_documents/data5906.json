    "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis is most commonly seen in patients with immune disorders and usually in the lung. Local invasive aspergillosis of the gastrointestinal system is quite rare. A 13-year-old female without immune deficiency presented with acute abdomen due to full-thickness necrosis of the gastric fundus. The necrotic gastric wall was excised and the stomach repaired. The pathology revealed a gastric ulcer with invading Aspergillus hyphae and spores. Aspergillosis is an opportunistic infection and its spores cannot survive in the normal gastric mucosa. The Aspergillus spores in this case probably grew on a background of gastric ulcer and caused wall necrosis and that the surgical treatment possibly provided a cure because it remained localized to the gastric wall.",
