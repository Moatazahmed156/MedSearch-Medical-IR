  "title": "Integrated 3D-Printed Microfluidic Device for Immunocapture and Electrochemical Assessment of Transferrin Saturation in ",
  "abstract": "A 3D-printed electrochemical microfluidic device (3D-EMD) was developed to assess the transferrin saturation (TSAT) biomarker in ischemic stroke patients. The all-in-one 3D-EMD integrates a strategically engineered immunoassay module for the direct and selective isolation of transferrin (Tf) from unpretreated clinical samples, unaffected by sample coloration, with an interchangeable electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous detection of Tf and Tf-bound iron. Both modules are interconnected through microfluidic channels whose flow is regulated by a cylindrical rotary valve. The analytical workflow enables magnetic bead-based direct Tf immunocapture and simultaneous electrochemical detection of Tf and Tf-bound iron via square wave voltammetry, allowing TSAT assessment within 60 min using only 50 μL of sample. Validation with certified reference materials demonstrated excellent accuracy (",
