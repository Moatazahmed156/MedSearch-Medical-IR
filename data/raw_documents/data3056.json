    "abstract": "Unintentional weight loss is a common clinical problem with a broad differential diagnosis that is clinically important because of the associated risks of morbidity and mortality. Community-dwelling adults are often diagnosed with malignancy, nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders as the cause of unintentional weight loss, whereas institutionalized older adults are diagnosed most often with psychiatric disorders. Up to a quarter of patients do not have a diagnosis after comprehensive workup, and close follow-up is warranted. Treatment involves management of underlying causes.",
