    "abstract": "It is difficult to precise when the diverse phenomenons that precede Gastric Cancer start. Diverse events occur in between from the genetic alternations to the advanced gastric carcinoma: inflammatory changes like gastritis, erosions, ulcerations, hyperplasia and benign neoplasias as the adenomas. On these lesions, dysplasia and later on early gastric carcinoma are established. These events have been observed and interpreted, some times in an outstanding way, by diverse authors. The current concept of the link between dysplasia and early gastric cancer is irrefutable.",
