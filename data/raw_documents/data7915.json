    "abstract": "Background and objectives: The prevalence of obesity among adults has reached epidemic proportions in Latin America, placing large demands on health care systems. Research suggests cultural differences in body weight perceptions may be a barrier during the implementation of weight-loss strategies. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of weight misperception in Peruvian women and evaluate contributing factors. Materials and Methods: A total of 236 women were recruited in San Martín, northern Peru. Participants' socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes towards their weight and health were collected. Self-perception of weight status was assessed with a 10-point scale and compared with measured body mass index (BMI). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with underestimation of weight status. Results: A total of 65.2% of women were classified as overweight/obese by BMI, but only 15.2% perceived themselves so. A total of 70.4% of women underestimated their weight status and no incidence of overestimation was reported. Overweight and obese women were more likely to underestimate their weight status than normal weight women (OR: 34.24, 95%CI: 11.55-101.45; OR: 42.06, 95%CI: 11.17-158.32, respectively). Women who underestimated weight status felt more comfortable with their weight (59.3% vs. 20.6, p < 0.001) and agreed a large stomach is a sign of good health (40.7% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001) versus those who correctly estimated. Conclusions: Underestimation of weigh status was highly prevalent and associated with unhealthy beliefs. Future public health programs must be culturally sensitive and tailored to specific groups within the population.",
