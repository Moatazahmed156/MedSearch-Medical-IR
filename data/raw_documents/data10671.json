  "title": "Performance of the Verily Study Watch for measuring sleep compared to polysomnography.",
  "abstract": "This study evaluated the performance of a wrist-worn wearable, Verily Study Watch (VSW), in detecting key sleep measures against polysomnography (PSG). We collected data from 41 adults without obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia during a single overnight laboratory visit. We evaluated epoch-by-epoch performance for sleep vs. wake classification, sleep stage classification and duration, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), and number of awakenings (NAWK). Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa, and Bland-Altman analyses. Sensitivity and specificity (95% CIs) of sleep vs. wake classification were 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 0.70 (0.66, 0.74), respectively. Cohen's kappa (95% CI) for 4-class stage detection was 0.64 (0.18, 0.82). Most VSW sleep measures had proportional bias. The mean bias values (95% CI) were 14.0 min (5.55, 23.20) for TST, -13.1 min (-21.33, -6.21) for WASO, 2.97% (1.25, 4.84) for SE, -1.34 min (-7.29, 4.81) for SOL, 1.91 min (-8.28, 11.98) for  Results support applying the VSW to track overnight sleep measures in free-living settings.
