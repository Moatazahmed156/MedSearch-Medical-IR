    "abstract": "Lifestyle changes have significant impact on the pattern of sleep-in pregnant women. Irregular sleep patterns in pregnant women can lead to anaemia and disturbances in the formation of growth hormones, hence, causing interference in the progress and maturation of children, which includes increased potentials for stunted growth. This literature review aims to discuss the influence of the sleep quality of pregnant women on the incidence of stunting of newborns. The methodology in this study techniques is the result of a comprehensive literature review. The data for this study was obtained from three databases, namely Scopus, Google Scholar, and media articles, using specific criteria for inclusion and exclusion. The major findings suggest that pregnant women with suboptimal sleep quality leading to disruptions in haemoglobin and anaemia. This is attributable to a lack of Non-Rapid Eyes Movement (NREM) sleep phase, where the growth hormone is produced. We conclude that the quality of sleep-in pregnant women influences the incidence of stunting in children.",
