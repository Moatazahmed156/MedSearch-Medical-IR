    "abstract": "Appropriate physical activity has more benefits than risks for older people. Increased physical activity enhances older people's mental and physical well-being and can contribute to reduced morbidity and early mortality. Nurses have an important role in advising older people on the level of physical activity that is right for them. Based on the national requirements for physical activity in older people, nurses can tailor their advice to each individual, address the person's concerns about potential risks and emphasise the likely benefits of them becoming more physically active. This article explains the role of nurses in promoting and encouraging physical activity in older people. It describes the historical background of this area of health promotion, considers the challenges nurses experience and discusses the strategies they can use when advising older people on physical activity.",
