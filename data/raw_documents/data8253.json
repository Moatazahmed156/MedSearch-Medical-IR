    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Post-traumatic distal limb wounds cause discomfort and heal gradually by second intention. The topical application of Tri-Solfen (lidocaine hydrochloride, bupivacaine hydrochloride, adrenaline acid tartrate and cetrimide [LBAC]) produces effective postsurgical cutaneous analgesia in lambs, calves and piglets; however, its effect on wounds in horses is unknown.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The antinociceptive effect, measured by mechanical threshold (MT), and the wound healing impacts of LBAC compared with saline were investigated on surgically created 20 × 20 mm distal limb wounds in 10 horses. Treatment was applied once daily for 7 days following wounding on day 0. Mechanical thresholds were measured after treatment on days 1, 2 and 3. Healing was observed for 25 days.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The topical application of LBAC immediately following wounding and its reapplication 24 hours later increased the average MT on the first post-traumatic day by 3 Newtons. However, no antinociceptive benefit was observed on days 2 or 3. Treatment with LBAC did not adversely affect wound healing when compared with saline.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Methodological differences preclude absolute MT comparisons between studies. The experimental design did not include a model of contaminated or naturally occurring wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      LBAC may provide an early antinociceptive benefit when applied to uncontaminated surgically created wounds without compromising healing.",
