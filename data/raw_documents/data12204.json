  "title": "Anticancer Activity of Alectinib through Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin Complexation: In Vitro Evaluation on A549 Lung Cancer Cells.",
  "abstract": "Alectinib is an effective inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase utilized in the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Nonetheless, its limited solubility in water restricts its therapeutic effectiveness. This research seeks to improve the anticancer efficacy of alectinib through the formation of an inclusion complex with hydroxypro-pyl-β-cyclodextrin. The alectinib-hydroxypro-pyl-β-cyclodextrin complex was synthesized via the kneading method and characterized according to established studies. In vitro assays, such as cell viability (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay), colony formation, scratch wound healing, and tube formation assays, were conducted to assess the antiproliferative, antimigratory, and antiangiogenic activities of the complex in comparison to free alectinib. The alectinib-hydroxypro-pyl-β-cyclodextrin complex exhibited markedly increased cy-totoxicity, diminished colony formation, inhibited cell migration, and impaired tube formation compared to free alectinib. The findings indicate that hydroxypro-pyl-β-cyclodextrin complexation enhances the solubility and anticancer efficacy of alectinib, presenting a viable strategy for improving its therapeutic potential in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Alectinib, in conjunction with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, was evaluated for its effects on A549 cells, which are representative of non-small-cell lung cancer. This study focused on its anticancer activity and its influence on cell migration. Angiogenesis refers to the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels.",
