  "title": "Resectable non-small cell lung cancer in women: A disease-specific entity?",
  "abstract": "There may be important sex-specific differences among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this, women are underrepresented in prospective clinical trials. We evaluated sex-specific differences in clinicopathologic and genetic factors and survival among patients with NSCLC. This is a single-center study at a high-volume dedicated cancer hospital. Patients with NSCLC who underwent complete surgical resection from 2010 to 2018 were included. Primary outcomes include cumulative incidence of recurrence and overall survival, stratified by sex. Overall, 3452 patients were included; 2033 (59%) were women. More women than men were never-smokers (24% vs 13%;  Clinicopathologic and genetic factors and survival among patients with NSCLC differ on the basis of sex. NSCLC in women should be considered a disease-specific entity.",
