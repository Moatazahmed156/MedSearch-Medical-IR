    "abstract": "Ensuring cell survival and tissue regeneration by maintaining cellular integrity is important to the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including kidney disease. Mitsugumin 53 (MG53) is a member of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family that plays an essential role in repairing cell membrane injury and improving tissue regeneration. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that MG53 plays a renoprotective role in kidney diseases. Moreover, with the beneficial effects of the recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein in the treatment of kidney diseases in different animal models, rhMG53 shows significant therapeutic potential in kidney disease. In this review, we elucidate the role of MG53 and its molecular mechanism in kidney disease to provide new approaches to the treatment of kidney disease.",
