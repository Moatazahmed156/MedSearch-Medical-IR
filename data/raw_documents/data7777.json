    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      This study aimed to explore young adult donors' experiences of living donor liver transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A phenomenological research method was used. The participants were two women and six men. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews from November 25th, 2019 to June 10th, 2020 and analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five theme clusters extracted from the young adult donors' experiences were painful decision of a liver donation, the agony of both mind and body that overpowers youth, the bitter and bare face of reality that a young donor encounters, feeling the power of love that fills up the space of the organ removed, and liver donation becoming priming water for maturity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of the lives of young adult donors who have experienced unexpected difficulties as well as self growth from the donation. It is expected that the results can be of use for developing and applying customized nursing interventions for management before and after liver donation among young adult donors.",
