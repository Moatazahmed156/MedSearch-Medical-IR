  "title": "Immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion: Possibilities and prospects.",
  "abstract": "Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable tumor control through immune activation. Emerging evidence suggests that beyond cytotoxic elimination, immune responses can reprogram malignant cells toward normalized, differentiated states, a phenomenon termed immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion. This paradigm shift positions the immune system as a restorative rather than solely destructive force. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence on immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion, evaluating mechanistic pathways and clinical implications across diverse malignancies to establish a conceptual framework for immune-driven phenotypic normalization. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, encompassing literature from 2015 to 2025. Evidence was synthesized thematically across immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell therapies, cytokine modulation, and microenvironmental remodeling. Immune-mediated reversion arises through coordinated epigenetic, metabolic, and microenvironmental reprogramming. Checkpoint inhibitors restore differentiation programs via IFNγ-driven chromatin remodeling, while CAR-T and NK-cell therapies induce metabolic normalization and epithelial restoration. Cytokine signaling and macrophage reprogramming reinforce reversion by modulating angiogenesis and stromal architecture. Clinical observations across melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, hematologic malignancies, and hepatocellular carcinoma support this restorative immune process. Single-cell and spatial omics identify transitional states bridging malignancy and normalcy. Immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion represents a conceptual frontier shifting oncology from eradication to restoration. Future progress requires defining biomarkers, confirming mechanistic permanence, and redesigning clinical endpoints. As integrative immuno-epigenetic frameworks mature, immune-driven reversion may evolve from biological curiosity to clinically reproducible pathway toward durable remission and functional cure.",
