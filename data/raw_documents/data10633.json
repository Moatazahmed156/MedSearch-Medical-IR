  "title": "Clinical Utility of Central and Peripheral Airway Nitric Oxide in Children with Different Types of Allergic Asthma.",
  "abstract": "Fractional exhaled nitric oxide has been widely used as a biomarker of airway inflammation. By measuring nitric oxide concentrations at different exhalation flow rates, it is possible to assess inflammation in various segments of the respiratory tract. This study hypothesized that FeNO could serve as a valuable tool for evaluating airway inflammation in children with different types of allergic asthma. This retrospective single-center study included 487 children with asthma, categorized as inhalant-sensitized (n=238), food-sensitized (n=36), mixed-sensitized (n=181), and non-sensitized controls (n=32). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide was measured following ERS/ATS protocols, including FeNO FeNO FeNO",
