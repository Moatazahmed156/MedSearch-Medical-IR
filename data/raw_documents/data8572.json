    "abstract": "Bacterial toxins are thought to play a role in delayed wound healing in critically colonised and infected wounds. Endotoxins are released from Gram-negative bacteria when they are lysed by host phagocytic cells during an immune response, or by antimicrobial agents, potentially leading to a detrimental effect on the host tissues. Endotoxins can affect all aspects of the wound healing process, leading to delayed healing and contributing to wound chronicity. Release of endotoxins by bacteria can also have serious systemic effects (for example, septic shock) that can lead to high levels of patient mortality. This review summarises the role and implications on wound healing of bacterial endotoxins, describing the impact of endotoxins on the various phases of the wound healing response. There is a paucity of in vivo/clinical evidence linking endotoxins attributed to a wound (via antibiotic treatment) or their release from infecting bacteria with parameters of delayed wound healing. Future work should investigate if this link is apparent and determine the mechanism(s) by which such detrimental effects occur, offering an opportunity to identify possible treatment pathways. This paper describes the phenomenon of antimicrobial-induced endotoxin release and summarises the use of wound dressings to reduce wound bioburden without inducing microbial death and subsequent release of endotoxins, thus limiting their detrimental effects.",
