    "abstract": "Since 1972, a number of publications, in particular in the Anglo-American literature, have reported the occurrence of drug-induced esophagitis. Among the causative agents under discussion, tetracyclines and their derivatives play a leading role. We now report on a case with the aim of describing the typical course and clinical symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of such ulcerative esophagitis, and also consider the pathophysiological basis for its development.",
