    "abstract": "Ischemic strokes in young adults are increasing in incidence and have emerged as a public health issue. The radiological features are not only diagnostic in identifying ischemic infarctions but also provide important clues in the investigation of the underlying causes or in the identification of risk factors. According to the different imaging patterns associated with ischemic stroke in young adults, the causes can be classified into 5 categories: cardioembolism, large vessel vasculopathy, small vessel vasculopathy, toxic-metabolic, and hypercoagulable disorders. The radiological features of each category and cause are described and summarized in this review.",
