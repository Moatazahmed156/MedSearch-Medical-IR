    "abstract": "Epidural electrical spinal stimulation can facilitate recovery of volitional motor control in individuals that have been completely paralyzed for more than a year. We recently reported a novel neuromodulation method named Dynamic Stimulation (DS), which short-lastingly increased spinal excitability and generated a robust modulation of locomotor networks in fully-anesthetized intact adult rats. In the present study, we applied repetitive DS patterns to four lumbosacral segments acutely after a contusive injury at lumbar level. Repetitive DS delivery restored the spinally-evoked motor EMG responses that were previously suppressed by a calibrated spinal cord contusion. Sham experiments without DS delivery did not allow any spontaneous recovery. Thus, DS uniquely provides the potential for a greater long-term functional recovery after paralysis.",
