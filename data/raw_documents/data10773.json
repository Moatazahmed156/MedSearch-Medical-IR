  "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) clinical trials often require multiregional esophageal inflammation. To determine if patient-reported outcomes (PROs) worsen with multiregional eosinophil inflammation (≥15 eosinophils/high power field), we compared outcomes scores when multiple (proximal/mid/distal) esophageal regions, versus one, were inflamed. The Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders Researchers database was searched for peak eosinophil counts (PECs), eosinophilic esophagitis histology scoring system scores, and PRO scores (eosinophilic esophagitis activity index; Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score; EoE quality of life; Pediatric Quality of Life Eosinophilic Esophagitis modulev3.0) in submissions from one or more regions. Analyses were performed with unadjusted or adjusted (adults: age, sex, dilation within 1 year; children: age, sex) data, using Wilcoxon rank sum and T test, and least squares mean, respectively. An interaction test was used for subgroup analysis.  Adult PEC was 60.2 ± 44.8 vs 39.5 ± 29.9 (mean ± standard deviation,  Multiregional compared to uniregional esophageal eosinophil inflammation does not significantly impact most PRO scores, and may not be necessary for all clinical trials.",
