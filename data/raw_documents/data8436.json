    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The classification of myocardial infarction into 5 types was introduced in 2007 as an important component of the universal definition. In contrast to the plaque rupture-related type 1 myocardial infarction, type 2 myocardial infarction is considered to be caused by an imbalance between demand and supply of oxygen in the myocardium. However, no specific criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction have been established.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We prospectively studied unselected hospital patients who had cardiac troponin I measured on clinical indication. The diagnosis and classification of myocardial infarction were established, and the frequency and features of type 2 myocardial infarction were investigated by use of novel developed criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From January 2010 to January 2011, a total of 7230 consecutive patients who had cardiac troponin I measured were evaluated, and 4499 patients qualified for inclusion. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction was established in 553 patients, of whom 386 (72%) had a type 1 myocardial infarction and 144 (26%) had a type 2 myocardial infarction. Patients in the group with type 2 myocardial infarction were older and more likely to be female, and had more comorbidities. The proportion of patients without significant coronary artery disease was higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (45%) than in those with type 1 myocardial infarction (12%) (P < .001). Tachyarrhythmias, anemia, and respiratory failure were the most prevalent mechanisms causing type 2 myocardial infarction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In a cohort of patients with myocardial infarction who were admitted consecutively through 1 year, the category of type 2 myocardial infarction comprised one fourth when diagnosed by the use of newly developed criteria. Approximately half of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction had no significant coronary artery disease.",
