    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although men make up a small percentage of those diagnosed with breast cancer, they are usually diagnosed at a later stage than women, increasing their chance of mortality. The reasons for this gender disparity require additional study.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This article examines current literature on male breast cancer, including reasons for the gender disparity and interventions that may help to address it.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An integrative review was conducted, and 12 studies were selected for inclusion.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Study consensus is that male breast cancer is an underresearched subject and that increased research efforts may improve outcomes. In addition, interventions could help to decrease the gender disparity in breast cancer detection.",
