  "title": "Enhancing creatinine detection: Innovative biosensors for monitoring kidney function.",
  "abstract": "Creatinine is a waste product generated from muscle metabolism, and its levels in the blood and urine serve as key indicators of renal function. Fast and sensitive detection of creatinine is crucial for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and guiding treatment decisions. Recent advancements in nanomaterials have led to the development of innovative biosensors for creatinine monitoring, providing a transformative approach to kidney disease diagnostics. This paper explores the potential of nanomaterial-based biosensors to enhance sensitivity, specificity, and rapid response times in detecting creatinine levels, a critical biomarker for kidney function assessment. We review various nanomaterials, including carbon-based nanostructures, metal nanoparticles, and quantum dots, highlighting their unique electrochemical properties and biocompatibility. These materials exhibit enhanced surface area and reactivity, contributing to improved sensitivity and specificity, thus enabling the identification of lower concentrations of creatinine while minimizing interference from other substances. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of these biosensors into wearable technologies to facilitate continuous monitoring, making early detection of kidney issues more accessible. This advancement empowers patients to monitor their health in real-time while generating valuable data for personalized medicine strategies. Our findings indicate that these novel biosensing platforms not only improve diagnostic accuracy but also play a crucial role in reducing the burden of chronic kidney diseases. In addition, implementing these biosensors could significantly streamline the diagnostic process, allowing for timely interventions. Ultimately, our study underscores the crucial role of innovative biosensing technologies in enhancing renal health management.",
