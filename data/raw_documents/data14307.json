  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial joint disorder characterized by articular cartilage degradation and progressive synovial inflammation. The dense and avascular nature of cartilage hinders the delivery efficiency of nanocarriers to their target cells, resulting in limited therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. Here, we report the design of a Piezo-MnO",
