  "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles (<200 nm) released into bodily fluids, carrying proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that reflect the state of their parent cells. In lung cancer, bacterial infections can worsen disease progression by altering sEV composition, influencing immune responses, metastasis, and therapy resistance. However, current tools are limited in profiling host-derived sEVs during host-pathogen interactions. Here, we present an integrated microfluidic platform for on-chip analysis of sEVs from A549 lung epithelial cells infected with ",
