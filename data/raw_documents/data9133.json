    "abstract": "Stem cell banking has been a topic of discussion and debate for more than a decade since the first public services to supply human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were established in the USA and the UK. This topic has received a recent revival with numerous ambitious programmes announced to deliver large collections of human induced pluripotency cell (hiPSC) lines. This chapter will provide a brief overview charting the development of stem cell banks, their value, and their likely role in the future.",
