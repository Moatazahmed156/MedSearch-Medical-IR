    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Vulvar ulcers may be caused by various etiologies including infection, trauma, dermatosis, and cancer. We report a case of a vulvar ulcer caused by botryomycosis.\n    \n\n\n          Case:\n        \n      \n      An 85-year-old woman presented with vulvar itching, pain, bleeding, and ulcerations suspicious for cancer. Biopsies of the ulcers returned without dysplasia or malignancy. She was referred to the tertiary care vulvar vaginal disease clinic. Dermatopathologic reevaluation of pathologic slides diagnosed lichen sclerosus and botryomycosis. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin for 7 weeks with complete resolution of vulvar ulcerations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Botryomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of infectious etiology of vulvar ulcers.",
