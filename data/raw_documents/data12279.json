  "title": "Enhancement of Patient-Centered Lung Cancer Screening: The MyLungHealth Randomized Clinical Trial.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) remains underused in the US, partly because of incomplete smoking history documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) and limited time for shared decision-making in primary care. To determine whether a patient-facing, EHR-integrated tool combined with clinician-facing clinical decision support improves the identification of LCS-eligible patients and the ordering of low-dose CT compared with clinician-facing tools alone. This pragmatic, unstratified, randomized clinical trial with parallel groups was conducted from March 29, 2024, to March 28, 2025, at primary care clinics at University of Utah Health and New York University Langone Health. Adults aged 50 to 79 years with a documented smoking history, an active patient portal account, and a primary care visit in the preceding year were included. Study 1 enrolled patients with uncertain LCS eligibility (10 to 19 pack-years, unknown pack-years, or missing quit date); study 2 enrolled patients with documented eligibility (20 or more pack-years and currently smoking or quit smoking within 15 years). The control included the clinician-facing Decision Precision+ tool (preventive care reminders and a shared decision-making tool). The intervention included the Decision Precision+ tool as well as the MyLungHealth tool, which collected detailed smoking history (study 1) and delivered personalized education and risk/benefit information (studies 1 and 2) via the patient portal in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients newly identified as eligible for LCS (study 1) and low-dose CT ordering rates (study 2) over 12 months. Analyses used intention-to-treat mixed-effects logistic regression. There were 31 303 randomized participants, including 26 729 in study 1 (13 144 [49.2%] female; 13 580 [50.8%] male; median [IQR] age, 62 [55-69] years) and 4574 in study 2 (2230 [48.8%] female; 2344 [51.2%] male; median [IQR] age, 63 [56-69] years). In study 1, the MyLungHealth tool increased new LCS eligibility identification (635 of 13 412 [4.7%] vs 308 of 13 317 [2.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.99-2.42; P < .001). In study 2, low-dose CT ordering was higher in the intervention arm (474 of 2312 [20.5%] vs 434 of 2262 [19.2%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.30; P = .008). In this randomized clinical trial, integrating a patient-centered tool into primary care EHR workflows increased the identification of patients eligible for LCS and the ordering of low-dose CTs. The relative increases in these primary outcomes were substantial, but absolute increases were more modest. Research on more intensive interventions is warranted to evaluate their ability to further improve LCS screening. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06338592.",
