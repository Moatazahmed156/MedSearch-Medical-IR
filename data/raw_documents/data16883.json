  "title": "Slower Pace of Intellectual Development Is Common in Children With Cerebral Palsy-A Population-Based Study.",
  "abstract": "To describe the intellectual level and changes during development in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to investigate if there are factors associated with the pace of intellectual development. Population-based study of all 264 children (141 boys, 123 girls) with CP born 1999-2006 in the region of Västra Götaland. Information was retrieved from the CP Register of western Sweden and all medical records to the age of 18 years. For the 171 children assessed more than once, results from first and last assessments were further compared. Intellectual disability became more common with increasing age. Forty percent of the 264 children were diagnosed with intellectual disability at age 7, 50% at age 12% and 54% at age 18. Of the 171 children assessed more than once, 55% showed a lower intellectual level over time. Epilepsy, predominant grey matter brain injury, impaired communication and fine motor function were associated with increased risk of slower pace of intellectual development. Intellectual disability as well as slower pace of intellectual development over time are common in children with CP, highlighting the importance of repeated intellectual assessments, especially in children with epilepsy, predominant grey matter brain injury, impaired communication or fine motor function.",
