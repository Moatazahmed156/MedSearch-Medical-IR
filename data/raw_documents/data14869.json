  "title": "Prevalence and Risk Factors for Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Vulnerable Populations in Romania: A Population-based Screening from the LIVE(RO)2 Program.",
  "abstract": "Viral hepatitis C remains one of the leading causes of virus-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, being the main etiological cause of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma which transforms it into a global health problem. It investigated the prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Romania. This prospective study was conducted between 2021 and 2023 by an extensive national Romanian screening program LIVE(RO)2 of 320,000 participants, most of whom being a part of deemed vulnerable populations. All participants agreed to an informed written consent and potential risk factors for HCV transmission were investigated by questionnaire. Out of the 320,000 screened individuals, 3,859 were infected with HCV meaning 1.21% prevalence (95%CI: 1.17-1.24). HCV-infected individuals were meanly aged at 65.8 ± 12.93 years, significantly higher as compared to non-infected participants (54.03 ± 16.41 years, p<0.0001). The main risk factors associated with HCV chronic infection included male gender, being aged between 30-49 or 60-69 years old, low level of education, being unvaccinated, unemployed, not married, with personal history of blood or blood products transfusion, hemodialysis, surgical interventions, tattooing, being in contact with family members with hepatitis, with hospitalizations, imprisoned, and performing unprotected sexual contacts or with partners diagnosed with sexually transmitted infectious diseases. The prevalence of HCV infection in Romania is 1.21%. Additional to providing supplemental healthcare support to vulnerable populations, the current study contributes in Romania's national HCV elimination objectives.",
