    "abstract": "The skin is an intricate network of both neurons and immunocytes, where emerging evidence has indicated that the regulation of neural-inflammatory processes may play a crucial role in mediating wound healing. Disease associated abnormal immunological dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy are implicated in the pathogenesis of wound healing impairment. However, the mechanisms through which neural-inflammatory interactions modulate wound healing remain ambiguous. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide novel insights to develop therapeutic devices, which could manipulate neural-inflammatory crosstalk to aid wound healing. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the neural-inflammatory interactions during different stages of the repair process. Numerous mediators including neuropeptides secreted by the sensory and autonomic nerve fibers and cytokines produced by immunocytes play an essential part during the distinct phases of wound healing.",
