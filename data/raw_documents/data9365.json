  "abstract": "(Abstracted from Diabetes Care 2025;48:887-895) After delivery, women who experience hyperglycemia during pregnancy are recommended to undergo a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to reclassify their glycemic status and assess type 2 diabetes risk. This test has proven to be an effective predictor, but uptake rates are low at around 50%, likely due to limited availability of new mothers and uncertainty about which provider is responsible for ordering the test.",
