    "abstract": "The immune system is a complex network comprising many different organs and cell types, all of which have to work together in a highly accurate manner to exert their function. How is it, then, that the key players of adaptive immunity, T cells, B cells and dendritic cells (DC) move through this network? How is compartmentalization maintained and how do they interact? Over the past decade much attention has been paid to how and where T-cell/DC interactions take place, but only recently--with the advent of new techniques--has research been directed to investigate 'live' T-cell/DC interactions ex vivo and in situ. Whereas the overall sequence of events leading to T-cell activation is largely undisputed, many of the cellular and molecular details of early T-cell priming remain undefined or controversial. This review will focus on recent findings and discuss their implications for T-cell activation.",
