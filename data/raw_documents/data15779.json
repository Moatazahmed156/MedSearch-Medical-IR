  "title": "Surveillance of Healthcare-Associated Infections in the WHO African Region: Systematic Review of Literature from 2011 to 2024.",
  "abstract": "Evidence on HAIs in Africa is fairly common. The main objective was to identify the surveillance tools used for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in countries in the WHO African Region. Secondary objectives focused on the organization of surveillance, the pathogens involved, and the frequency of multidrug-resistant species. Observational or interventional studies on healthcare-associated infections in humans, published between January 2011 and December 2024, in French or English, were included. However, the following publications were not included: animal studies, healthcare-associated infections not related to healthcare, literature reviews, studies outside the period or geographical area, and studies in languages other than French or English. Sources of information and search date: The databases consulted were PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, African Index Medicus, Google Scholar, and AJOL. The search was conducted between January and March 2025. Risk of bias assessment: The risk of bias was assessed using a specific grid (eleven criteria), scored from one (low) to three (high). The studies were classified into three levels of methodological quality. The results of the bias assessment showed that the publications were excellent (strong and moderate) with a cumulative rate of 99.9%. Methods of synthesizing results: Data were extracted using a standardized grid and synthesized narratively. No meta-analysis was performed. Number of studies and characteristics: 95 studies were included, mostly cross-sectional studies (82.1%), cohorts (10.4%), and a few case reports. Most were from West Africa (60.0%), particularly Nigeria (16.8%) and South Africa (14.7%). • Most common pathogens: ",
