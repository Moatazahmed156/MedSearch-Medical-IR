    "abstract": "Rice transitory yellowing virus (RTYV), a member of the genus Nucleorhabdovirus, is closely related to or synonymous with rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV). To clarify the relationship between RTYV and RYSV, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the RTYV genome. The RTYV genome consists of 14,029 nucleotides. The overall nucleotide identity between RTYV and RYSV was 98.5%, and the deduced amino acid sequence identities between the seven genes in RTYV and RYSV ranged from 82.3 to 99.7%. The sequence information from RTYV revealed that these two viruses should be categorized as members of the same species rather than distinct species.",
