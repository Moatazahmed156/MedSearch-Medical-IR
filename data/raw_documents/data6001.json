    "abstract": "For hundreds of years, universal medical practice has depicted the heart to be the central organ, showing the heart's function as the primary source of energy for blood circulation, paying particular importance to the role of the heart valves. At present the generally accepted paradigm: the main force component of blood circulation is the pressure-gradient generated by the working heart. In serious combined illnesses of heart valves, the function of the valve is almost nonexistent. Based on the value of pressure in the chambers of the heart and in the great arteries and veins, blood flows from a place of high pressure to lower pressure, and should work the other way around as well. It is a fact, however, that even in such cases the circulation of blood is directed from the main arteries towards the veins: without the function of the valves--seemingly opposing the basic laws of physics--it keeps its original direction. Therefore we can justifiably infer that it isn't the work of the heart muscle that provides the source of energy for blood circulation. The heart has an essential function in the maintenance of blood circulation: pulse generation. The principal role of the heart is to generate pulses and not pressure.",
