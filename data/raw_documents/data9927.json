  "title": "Lactate and procalcitonin combined with qSOFA score for the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in ICU patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.",
  "abstract": "Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and early prognostic assessment is essential for improving outcomes. Although the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is widely used for bedside risk stratification, its standalone predictive performance is limited. Integrating biochemical markers such as lactate and procalcitonin (PCT) may improve prognostic accuracy. This study was designed to evaluate the combined value of qSOFA, lactate, and PCT in assessing disease severity and mortality risk, and to clarify the prognostic utility of dynamic monitoring at multiple time points. This retrospective study included 128 ICU patients with sepsis, categorized into qSOFA < 2 ( Patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 had significantly higher ICU and 28-day mortality ( A qSOFA score ≥ 2 identifies patients at higher risk of mortality. Dynamic monitoring of lactate and PCT significantly enhances early prognostic evaluation, and their combined use with qSOFA provides improved risk stratification for ICU patients with sepsis.",
