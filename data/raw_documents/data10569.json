  "title": "AORI-HAP: a multidimensional risk index to predict in-hospital adverse outcomes in asthma exacerbations.",
  "abstract": "Despite therapeutic advancements, asthma exacerbations (AEs) remain a major clinical challenge, with immune-inflammatory patterns incompletely characterized. Current guidelines lack robust multidimensional tools for predicting in-hospital adverse outcomes. To develop and validate the Asthma Outcome Risk Index for Hospitalized Patients (AORI-HAP), integrating multidimensional predictors, and investigate immune-inflammatory mechanisms underlying adverse outcomes. This real-world cohort study enrolled hospitalized AE patients. Univariate analyses identified associations between multidimensional biomarkers and composite outcome (death, ICU admission, invasive ventilation). LASSO logistic regression derived the AORI-HAP, stratifying patients into risk categories. Mediation analysis elucidated mechanistic contributions to adverse outcomes. The AORI-HAP identified five independent predictors of adverse outcomes: elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR > 8.3, OR = 9.26,  AORI-HAP facilitates early risk stratification at admission and personalized management in hospitalized asthma patients. NLR's mediating role underscores its utility as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target.",
