  "title": "Diagnostic Potential of miR-146a-5p in Differentiating Active and Latent Tuberculosis Infections: A Cross-sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of which involves miR-146a-5p as a specific microRNA molecule that is expressed exclusively on immune cells to modulate innate immunity. This study aims to examine and compare the expression of miR-146a-5p in active and latent TB patients. This study utilized a descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional design. We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method to examine the strength of miR-146a-5p expression. Statistical analysis involved employing descriptive statistics to summarize the sample characteristics. One-way analysis of variance was utilized to conduct inferential analysis, evaluating the differences in miR-146a-5p expression across various groups. The odds ratio calculation was employed to assess the strength of association, whereas the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to examine the diagnostic potential. The results showed that men dominated the incidence of active TB compared to women with a prevalence of 83% and 17%, respectively. While in latent TB, women dominated compared to men (78% and 22%). The results of the examination of miR-146a-5pexpression in active TB samples were up regulation with a value of 24,86535, whereas in latent TB samples were down regulation with a value of 0,22727. Active TB and latent TB samples showed a significant comparison in terms of miR-146a-5p expression. Based on the research we have done, miR-146a-5p can be used as a biomarker in TB infection.",
