  "title": "Neuromuscular and proprioceptive exercises for knee osteoarthritis: building balance, stability, and patient confidence.",
  "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by pain, reduced mobility, and diminished quality of life. While surgical interventions and joint injections are common, exercise remains central to non-operative management. However, increased pain during exercise can lead to non-compliance, often due to instability. Therefore, any exercise regimen should address this instability to improve compliance. The ARISE neuromuscular program is a proprioceptive-based exercise program designed to address instability while increasing strength. A 67-year-old male with knee OA, initially seeking an injection, was counseled to use the ARISE program. At the 3-month follow-up, his pain reduced from 7/10 to 2/10, and his sit-to-stand performance improved from 10 to 17 repetitions within 30 s. This case supports the use of non-operative, proprioceptive-based neuromuscular programs to improve function, reduce symptoms, and potentially reduce the need for surgical intervention in individuals with knee OA.",
