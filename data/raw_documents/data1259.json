    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly coexist and adversely affect mortality when found together. AF begets HF and HF begets AF. Rhythm restoration with antiarrhythmic drugs failed to show a mortality benefit but can be effective in improving symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment of AF may be of value in the HF population.",
