    "abstract": "The role of the microbiota in multiple autoimmune diseases, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has earned substantial attention in the last 10 years. Increasing evidence suggests that the microbiota's link to JIA begins in early childhood, as early life events that influence the nature of the microbiota also appear to influence disease risk. In this review, we discuss these early life events including mode of delivery, infant feeding practice, antibiotics exposure, and other events and their impacts on the microbiota and on disease risk; reported abnormalities of the microbiota in children with JIA; mechanisms by which an altered microbiota at birth and later on in childhood may influence disease risk; and the prospects for therapeutic alteration of the microbiota in children with JIA.",
