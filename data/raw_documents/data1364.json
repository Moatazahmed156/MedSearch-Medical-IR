    "abstract": "The efficacy of the vaccines varies between individuals and populations. The immunogenicity of the vaccine is influenced by various factors, including host factors. Previous studies have shown that host factors affect the effectiveness of vaccines, which may be true about COVID-19 vaccines. In this review, we evaluate the possible association of host factors with vaccine efficacy with a special focus on COVID-19 vaccines.",
