    "abstract": "Female breasts are regarded as a factor reflecting women's morphological beauty. An appropriate bra can fulfill aesthetic needs, thus boosting self-esteem. This study proposed a method to analyze young women's breast-bra morphological variations between two identical bras with different bra cup thicknesses. The 3D surface scan data of 129 female students who were braless and wore a thin bra (13 mm) and a thick bra (23 mm) were analyzed. Integral sections of the breasts and bra were cut at a fixed thickness of 10 mm, and slice maps were derived. Morphological parameters were extracted in braless and the two bra conditions. The variations in breast-bra shape caused by different thicknesses of bra cups were evaluated by quantifying breast ptosis, gathering, and breast slice area. The results showed that the thin bra lifted the breasts by 2.16 cm, whereas the thick bra decreased breast separation, gathering the breasts and moving them 2.15 cm laterally towards the center of the chest wall. Moreover, prediction models constructed using the critical morphological parameters were used to characterize breast-bra shape after wearing the provided bras. The findings lay the groundwork for quantifying the breast-bra shape variation caused by different bra cup thicknesses, allowing young females to choose optimally fitting bras to achieve their desired breast aesthetics.",
