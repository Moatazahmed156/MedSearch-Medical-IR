  "title": "Gas stove and respiratory health: a cross-sectional study and a cohort study in Denmark, 2000-2018.",
  "abstract": "Knowledge on gas stove and adult respiratory health is limited. We studied the association between having a gas stove or not and respiratory health using cross-sectional and cohort designs. Information on gas stove and respiratory symptoms (e.g. bronchitis, asthma, cough) was obtained from the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey year 2000 (aged ≥ 16 years, n = 3491). Odds ratios (ORs) of respiratory symptoms were estimated by Logistic regressions. In the cohort study, 3444 asthma-free individuals were followed for up to 18 years, with incident asthma identified via Danish National Registers. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated by Poisson regression of incidence rates (IRs). Overall, 13.9% of participants had a gas stove. Respiratory symptoms ranged from 3.0% (bronchitis) to 12.1% (cough). The odds were significantly higher for bronchitis (OR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15-3.14), cough (OR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.11-1.91), and shortness of breath (OR 1.89: 95% CI, 1.30-2.77) among participants with gas stoves compared to participants without. In the cohort study the overall IR of asthma was 6.1 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted IRR of asthma was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.78-1.80). Having a gas stove was associated with higher risk of certain respiratory symptoms and indicated an increased asthma incidence.",
