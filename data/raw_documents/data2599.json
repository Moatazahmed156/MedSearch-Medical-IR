    "abstract": "Lower urinary tract disorders in men: which management? Initial management of men lower urinary tract symptoms is based on a well conducted interview and the realization of a frequency-volume chart. Dietary intervention associated with behavioral reeducation can be of great efficacy in combination with usual drug treatments. In case of failure, transuretral electrical resection of the prostate remains the reference, with possible emerging instrumental alternatives such as Urolift or prostatic embolization.",
