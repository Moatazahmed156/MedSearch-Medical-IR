    "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease in children (chILD) comprises a range of different rare diseases. There is limited evidence for the treatment of chILD and no randomised clinical trials of treatment have been undertaken. Most treatments are therefore prescribed off-label based on expert opinion. The off-label nature of prescription of drugs for chILD highlights the importance of a solid understanding of the side effects to facilitate risk-benefit assessment. The European Respiratory Society chILD guidelines recommend the use of systemic glucocorticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Side effects of these drugs will be discussed followed by consideration of other drugs used for the treatment of chILD.",
