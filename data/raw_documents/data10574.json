  "title": "Outdoor air pollutants and asthma risk in adolescents: evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Existing epidemiological evidence linking outdoor air pollution to asthma incidence in adolescents remains inconclusive, due to methodological heterogeneity in study design, exposure assessment, and asthma case definitions. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized observational studies examining associations between outdoor air pollutants and adolescent asthma. Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free-text terms. Eligible studies reported quantitative estimates, odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR), prevalence ratio (PR), incidence rate ratio (IRR), or prevalence odds ratio (POR), with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse-variance weighted fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's  Of 51 eligible studies, 40 were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Statistically significant associations were identified for each 10 μg/m This meta-analysis highlights significant associations between adolescent asthma and specific combustion-related air pollutants. Future research should prioritize standardized exposure metrics, life-course cohort designs, and multipollutant modeling to inform targeted prevention and public health strategies. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier PROSPERO database (CRD42024622246).",
