  "title": "Clinical factors associated with non-compliance with indicators of prescribed and infused volume of enteral nutrition therapy.",
  "abstract": "to evaluate the factors associated with non-compliance with the Quality Indicators in Nutritional Therapy (QINT) related to the prescribed and infused volume of Enteral Nutritional Therapy (ENT). cross-sectional study, aligned with a prospective cohort, carried out in two clinical wards and two surgical wards of a Brazilian public hospital of high complexity and reference in ENT. Patients aged > 18 years, of both sexes, who required ENT exclusively by tube were included. The QINT \"enteral volume infused index\" and \"frequency of days of adequate administration of the prescribed volume X volume infused in patients on ENT\" were analyzed. Multivariate Poisson regression was adopted to identify factors associated with the outcome. the 159 patients included totaled 565 days using ENT. The independent risk factors for non-compliance with the \"enteral volume infused index\" indicator were: being a surgical patient (HR: 2.12; 95 % CI: 1.31-3.41; p = 0.002), the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.34; 95 % CI: 1.54-3.57; p = 0.002) and use of antidiarrheals (HR: 2.35; 95 % CI: 1.45-3.80; p = 0.001). The use of antidiarrheals (HR 19.75; 95 % CI: 10.05-38.79; p = 0.000) was the only risk factor identified for non-compliance with the indicator \"frequency of days of adequate administration of the prescribed volume X volume infused in patients on ENT.\" surgical patients, those with COPD, and those using antidiarrheals are at greater risk of not reaching the prescribed ENT volume over the prescribed days.",
