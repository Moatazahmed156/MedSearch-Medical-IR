  "abstract": "Distinguishing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) from active tuberculosis (ATB) remains challenging. The roles of cuproptosis-ferroptosis crosstalk in TB immunopathology and diagnostic potential are unexplored. Transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus data sets (GSE37250/GSE28623) were analyzed to identify cuproptosis-/ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatics (limma, weighted gene co-expression network analysis) and machine learning (LASSO, SVM-RFE) screened key biomarkers. A logistic regression model (HeptaTB Dx Model) was developed and validated in independent cohorts. Real-world validation included RNA-seq ( The differentiation between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis (TB) is a persistent challenge in global TB control, with current diagnostics failing to reliably distinguish these states or predict progression. This study introduces the HeptaTB Dx Model, the first diagnostic signature derived from the crosstalk between cuproptosis and ferroptosis-two metal-dependent regulated cell death pathways with emerging roles in ",
