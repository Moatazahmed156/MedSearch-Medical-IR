  "title": "Impact of e-cigarettes and flavoured vapes on respiratory health: where are we now?",
  "abstract": "The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for delivering nicotine has increased markedly in recent years, raising concerns regarding their long-term safety and their potential to sustain nicotine dependence, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Marketed as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes warrant careful evaluation of both their short-term and long-term health risks. Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that e-cigarettes may serve as a tool for smoking reduction or cessation; however, available data indicate that usage often represents product switching rather than complete cessation. Given that e-cigarettes are not harmless, the advisability of recommending them as a smoking cessation aid remains controversial. Although long-term outcomes are not fully established, current research suggests that e-cigarettes could be responsible for acute lung injury, exacerbations of respiratory symptoms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression, and various pathophysiological changes associated with cytotoxicity and airway dysfunction. Considering the accumulating evidence of harm, e-cigarettes should be regulated similarly to conventional tobacco products, with strict restrictions on access for children and adolescents. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify their long-term health effects and to guide evidence-based public health policies.",
