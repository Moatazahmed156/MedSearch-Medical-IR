    "abstract": "This report describes a rare case of a gastric trichobezoar complicated by gastric perforation in a 14-year-old female. The patient presented with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. Computer tomography (CT) scan showed a pneumoperitoneum with a large trichobezoar in the stomach and free intra-abdominal fluid. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy, where a perforation on the lesser curve of the stomach was detected and a large trichobezoar that was occupying the entire stomach was removed. Histology confirmed a benign gastric ulcer most likely resulting from pressure necrosis due to the bezoar.",
