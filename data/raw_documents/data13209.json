  "abstract": "Synaptic density loss has been proposed as a major neuronal mechanism through which cognition degrades in Alzheimer's disease (AD). PET imaging studies have observed synaptic density change across the AD continuum using SV2A radiotracer [ [ A DS-specific T1 MRI template has been developed (LeMerise; 2022), and a [ Understanding the distribution of SV2A in DS will provide insight on changes to synaptic density in populations with accelerated AD neuropathology.",
