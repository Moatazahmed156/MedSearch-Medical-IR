  "title": "Prognostic Factors and Clinical Prediction Score for Progressive Respiratory Failure in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients Treated with Tocilizumab: A Multicenter Study.",
  "abstract": "A proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients develop respiratory failure despite tocilizumab administration. This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify prognostic factors associated with progressive respiratory failure within 14 days among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with Tocilizumab and to describe treatment outcomes. Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were assessed, and their demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and prior treatment were collected on the day of tocilizumab administration. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was employed to identify prognostic factors. Of the 109 patients, 32 (29.4%) progressed to respiratory failure. We identified the following independent prognostic factors for progressive respiratory failure: pulse oximetry saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO In severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients treated with Tocilizumab, low SpO",
