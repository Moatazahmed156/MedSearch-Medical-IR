  "title": "ER Stress-Related Biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Comprehensive Transcriptome, Mendelian Randomization, and Machine-Learning Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease; however, measures for preventing COPD and delaying disease progression are limited. Therefore, identifying genetic variations and novel biomarkers related to COPD incidence and progression is crucial for improving clinical outcomes. Here, we investigated the potential of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene DNAJB1 as a risk gene in COPD and its clinical value via bioinformatics and Mendelian randomization. We first performed differential gene analysis on single-cell sequencing datasets then identified candidate genes and genetic loci using Mendelian randomization analysis and co-localization analysis, respectively. Machine-learning analysis of microarray data was used to identify potential biomarkers. Subsequently, we explored the biological role of DNAJB1 through cellular communication, functional enrichment, and correlation analyses with inflammatory factors. DNAJB1 was identified as a risk gene for COPD that shares genetic variants with COPD. Nine key biological genes, including DNAJB1, were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers. High DNAJB1 expression and high scores for the endoplasmic reticulum stress gene set were validated using the microarray dataset. Our finding reveals DNAJB1 as a COPD risk gene and identifies a diagnostic genetic marker panel, providing useful perspectives for early diagnosis and the development of potential therapeutic targets.",
