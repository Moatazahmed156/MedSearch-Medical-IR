    "abstract": "Pyoderma gangrenosum manifests as recurrent deep ulceration of the skin and is associated with a variety of disorders. We report a 40-year-old man who developed ulcers on the flexor surface of his right lower limb following a trauma 10 years prior to the current presentation. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 20 years ago, and was previously placed on sulfasalazine and prednisolone. He also developed an enterocutaneous fistula at the right iliac fossa following an appendectomy he had 16 years previously. Mayo score of his ulcerative colitis was severe (11/12), and he received three courses of intravenous infliximab at irregular intervals as it was difficult to access Infliximab in Nigeria. He was stepped down to tablet Mesalazine after the third course due to cost considerations, and skin grafting was done for the extensive leg ulcer to achieve wound healing after failed steroid and sulfasalazine therapy.",
