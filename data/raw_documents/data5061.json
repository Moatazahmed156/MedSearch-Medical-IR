    "abstract": "Cellular therapies have shown increasing promise as a cancer treatment. Encouraging results against hematologic malignancies are paving the way to move into solid tumors. In this review, we will focus on T-cell therapies starting from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to optimized T-cell receptor-modified (TCR) cells and chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts). We will discuss the positive preclinical and clinical findings of these approaches, along with some of the persisting barriers that need to be overcome to improve outcomes.",
