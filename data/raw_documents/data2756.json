    "abstract": "To address the lack of theoretical guidance for sponge city construction (SCC) in China, this study introduces a method to evaluate the available water volume (AWV) in urban watersheds. This evaluation is based on the water balance relationship, water volume, and ecological water demand (EWD). The Xi'an urban area was selected as a case study due to its water shortage and flooding issues. Results show monthly surface and subsurface AWV ranging between 53.06 and 53.98 million m3 and between 8,701.89 and 8,898.14 million m3, respectively. By maximizing the potential for surface AWV, an annual water supply of 527.75 million m3 could be provided, surpassing the annual artificial water consumption of 394.20 million m3, effectively addressing water scarcity. During the rainy season, implementing measures such as employing permeable paving materials, establishing wetlands and rainwater gardens, and constructing lakes and reservoirs can mitigate flooding caused by rainfall exceeding 32.8 mm. While the subsurface space in Xi'an holds significant potential for subsurface AWV utilization, revitalizing the ecological environment of subsurface water is crucial. Overall, the AWV theoretical framework offers a comprehensive solution to water shortage and flooding issues in the Xi'an urban area, serving as a vital theory for SCC.",
