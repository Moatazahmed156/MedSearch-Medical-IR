    "abstract": "Intercellular tight junctions represent a formidable barrier against paracellular drug absorption at epithelia (e.g., nasal, intestinal) and the endothelium (e.g., blood-brain barrier). In order to enhance paracellular transport of drugs and increase their bioavailability and organ deposition, active excipients modulating tight junctions have been applied. First-generation of permeation enhancers (PEs) acted by unspecific interactions, while recently developed PEs address specific physiological mechanisms. Such target specific tight junction modulators (TJMs) have the advantage of a defined specific mechanism of action. To date, merely a few of these novel active excipients has entered into clinical trials, as their lack in safety and efficiency in vivo often impedes their commercialisation. A stronger focus on the development of such active excipients would result in an economic and therapeutic improvement of current and future drugs.",
