    "abstract": "Penetrating brain injury is a severe form of traumatic brain injury. It is significantly less prevalent than closed head injury but carries a much worse prognosis. The experience with traumatic penetrating brain injury in Denmark is limited. The most common causes in penetrating brain injury in Denmark are: violence, accidents and suicidal behaviour. The aim of this review is to give a brief update on historical background, mechanisms of disease, recommended medical and surgical treatment, and complications. Clinical examples and a treatment algorithm are discussed.",
