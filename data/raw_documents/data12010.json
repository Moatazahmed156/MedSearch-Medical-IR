  "title": "Revealing Prostate Calcification Heterogeneity through Their Elemental Distribution.",
  "abstract": "Calcifications across the body offer snapshots of the surrounding ionic environment at the time of their formation. Links between prostate calcification chemistry and cancer are becoming of increasing interest, particularly in identifying biomarkers for disease. This study utilizes X-ray fluorescence mapping of 72 human prostate calcifications, measured at the I18 beamline at the Diamond Light Source, to determine the links between calcifications and their environment. This paper offers the first investigation of the elemental heterogeneity of prostate calcifications, demonstrating lower relative levels of minor elements at the calcification center compared to the edge but higher levels of zinc. Importantly, this study uniquely presents links between average Fe, Cr, Mn, Cu, and Ni ratios and grade Group (a classification system for urological tumors, specifically for prostate cancer), highlighting a potential avenue of exploration for biomarkers in prostate calcifications.",
