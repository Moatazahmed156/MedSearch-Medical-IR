    "abstract": "To determine the accuracy and reliability of urodynamic studies performed during the course of unsuspected but significant lower urinary tract infection (greater than or equal to 10(5) organisms per mL), all the studies were repeated two and four weeks after successful treatment of urinary tract infection. Among 45% of patients (nine of 20) found to have unstable bladder before treatment of urinary infection, 60% of them (six of nine) regained bladder stability after appropriate treatment. Similarly, 30% of stress incontinent patients became continent after treatment of urinary infection and did not need surgery for correction of stress incontinence. Because of the high incidence of false-positive results of urodynamic studies when performed during infection (P less than .05), definite treatment of urinary incontinence should not be undertaken before successful treatment of urinary tract infection and repeating urodynamic studies in patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms.",
