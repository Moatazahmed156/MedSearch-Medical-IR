    "abstract": "Quality improvement is key to advancing outcomes for neurocritically ill patients. Variation in neurocritical care practice can lead to differences in health outcomes and contribute to health disparities. The implementation of evidence-based best practice standards represents a major opportunity to improve their care. Neurocritical care performance measures have recently been developed and may be used to target high priority areas for improvement. In addition, neurocritical care clinicians should be aware of the heavily weighted pay-for-performance and publicly reported performance measures that are directly relevant to neurocritical care practice.",
