    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal candidiasis in association with ulceration was diagnosed in 5 foals in which signs of colic had been nonresponsive to medical treatment. The ulceration was found in the stomach of all foals and in the esophagus of 1 foal. Candida colonized hyperkeratotic mucosa surrounding the ulcers, and the associated inflammation resulted in splitting of the mucosal epithelium. Loss of the superficial mucosa may have allowed invasion by bacteria, leading to ulceration.",
