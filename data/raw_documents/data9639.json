  "title": "Synthesis, characterization and molecular insights towards antidiabetic profiling of novel curcumin-derived Schiff base metal complexes.",
  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has persisted as a health challenge worldwide for millennia, compelling the search for novel therapeutics. This study reports the design of a novel Schiff base synthesized through the condensation of Curcumin and 4-amino-6-hydroxy-2-mercaptopyrimidine monohydrate, along with three corresponding metal(II) complexes (Cu, Zn, Co) as antidiabetic agents. The synthesized compounds were characterized using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, such as UV-vis, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), ESR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (",
