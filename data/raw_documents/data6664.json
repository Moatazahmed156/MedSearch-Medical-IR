    "abstract": "Recent advances in modern imaging allow an accurate identification of involved or suspicious lymph nodes within the nodal compartments of the neck. Careful ultrasonographic lymphatic mapping of the neck by an experienced radiologist allows a targeted, compartment-oriented (or selective) lymph node dissection to be performed instead of the more extensive modified radical lymph node dissection. Compartment-oriented lymph node dissection necessitates the close cooperation of an experienced radiologist with a particular interest in thyroid and neck ultrasonography. There is emerging evidence that this more conservative strategy allows local control of the disease while at the same time morbidity is minimized and a better cosmetic result is achieved. Further investigation is needed to establish the precise role of this interesting surgical approach.",
