    "abstract": "Mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases have always been a great threat to human health. Mosquito control based on sustainable vector management strategy is particularly important. In Zhejiang Province, exemplary villages of sustainable mosquito control (\"mosquito-free villages\") have been successful operated, providing a new model of mosquito control in rural areas based on local conditions. The construction of \"mosquito-free village\" will apply environmentally-friendly and appropriate technologies to eliminate and transform mosquito breeding sites and to establish mechanisms of cultivating villagers' health literacy of scientific mosquito control and voluntary participation in control activities to keep mosquito density low long-term.",
