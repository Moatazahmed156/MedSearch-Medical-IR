  "title": "HCMV as an Oncomodulatory Virus in Ovarian Cancer: Implications of Viral Strain Heterogeneity, Immunomodulation, and Inflammation on the Tumour Microenvironment and Ovarian Cancer Progression.",
  "abstract": "The complex relationship between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and cancer has been of interest since the 1960s. As a highly prevalent human β-herpesvirus, HCMV establishes lifelong latency in CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells and has been implicated as an oncomodulatory virus in various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, breast, prostate, colorectal, and ovarian cancer (OC). Recently, discussions have emerged regarding the classification of HCMV as an eighth oncovirus due to the persistence of its nucleic acids and proteins in many tumour types. As one of the deadliest gynaecological cancers, OC is often characterised as the 'silent killer' with less than half of women surviving for 5 years, a rate that drops below 20% when detected at advanced stages. Reported effects of HCMV vary between cancers, likely due to differences in tumour type, viral strain, and disease stage. While HCMV infection has been linked to poor OC patient outcomes, its impact on the OC tumour microenvironment (TME) and immune system remains less understood. Investigating HCMV's potential oncogenic role could provide critical insights into OC progression. This review discusses recent developments on HCMV's multifaceted roles in OC, including strain heterogeneity, immunomodulation of the TME, dysregulation of inflammatory signalling pathways, and potential therapeutic approaches targeting HCMV in anti-cancer immunotherapies.",
