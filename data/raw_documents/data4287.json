    "abstract": "This study explores olive flounder by-product Prozyme2000P (OFBP) hydrolysate as a potential treatment for age-related kidney decline. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death linked to iron overload and oxidative stress, is increasingly implicated in aging kidneys. We investigated whether OFBP could inhibit ferroptosis and improve kidney health. Using TCMK-1 cells, we found that OFBP treatment protected cells from ferroptosis induced by sodium iodate (SI). OFBP also preserved the mitochondria health and influenced molecules involved in ferroptosis regulation. In aging mice, oral administration of OFBP significantly improved kidney health markers. Microscopic examination revealed reduced thickening and scarring in the kidney's filtering units, a hallmark of aging. These findings suggest that OFBP hydrolysate may be a promising therapeutic candidate for age-related kidney decline. By inhibiting ferroptosis, OFBP treatment appears to improve both cellular and structural markers of kidney health. Further research is needed to understand how OFBP works fully and test its effectiveness in more complex models.",
