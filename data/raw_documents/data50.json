    "abstract": "Physical therapy and exercise (recreational activity) are the cornerstones of non-pharmacologic therapy in axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) [1, 2]. These are components of physical activity, though physical activity is made up of activities beyond these and also include occupational activity. Not all activities in AxSpA appear to derive the same benefit for patients. In fact, it might be that while some activities are extremely beneficial for disease activity, function, and other outcomes, other activities may be harmful for the disease. The following review will examine animal model-based evidence and epidemiologic studies on physical activity in AxSpA.",
