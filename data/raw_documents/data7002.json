    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is currently the second most common malignant tumor among gynecological cancers worldwide, primarily due to challenges in early diagnosis, high recurrence rates, and resistance to existing treatments. Current therapeutic options are inadequate for addressing the needs of ovarian cancer patients. Ferroptosis, a novel form of regulated cell death with demonstrated tumor-suppressive properties, has gained increasing attention in ovarian malignancy research. A growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis plays a significant role in the onset, progression, and incidence of ovarian cancer. Additionally, it has been found that immunotherapy, an emerging frontier in tumor treatment, synergizes with ferroptosis in the context of ovarian cancer. Consequently, ferroptosis is likely to become a critical target in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",
