    "abstract": "Collagen is a biopolymer found in the animal body. It is one of the most abundant proteins in the extracellular matrix that provides strength to the skin, joints, and bones in the human body. It is an important source of elasticity and strength in the extracellular matrix and contributes to the structural and physiological integrity of tissues. Collagen plays an important role in regulating the wound healing process. It helps in wound healing by attracting fibroblasts and encouraging new collagen formation in the wound bed. Therefore, it can be used as a supplementary aid for wound treatment to accelerate the healing process. A prominent benefit of incorporating collagen in wound dressings is its ability to enhance the healing process for critical wounds. Not only collagen but various collagen-containing systems are being prepared to boost its efficacy in wound healing. Different strategies like nanoscale reductions, biopolymers, and incorporating anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs with collagen have been reported. This review article emphasizes the use of collagen for wound healing and various collagen fabricated delivery systems such as nanofibres, nanoparticles, hydrogels, films, and sponges that aid in the healing of wounds.",
