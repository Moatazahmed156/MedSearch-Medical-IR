    "abstract": "Left atrium is not a passive heart chamber, because it has a dynamic motion respecting heart cycle and, in accordance with its stretching, it releases atrial natriuretic peptides. Since in the course of certain invasive procedures the size of left atrium may change substantially, its exact measurement and functional characterization are essential. The aim of the present review is to summarize echocardiographic methods for the assessment of left atrial size and functional parameters.",
