  "title": "A dual diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) alpha/zeta inhibitor augments the activity of human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in ",
  "abstract": "Endogenous or adoptively transferred tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) often lose their functional capacity due to the activation of intrinsic inhibitory pathways, which then limits their ability to control tumor growth. In this study, we examined the effects of blocking a key intracellular inhibitory enzyme, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) in human T cells, using a novel inhibitor (DGKi) called INCB165451 that blocks both DGKα and DGKζ, the two primary DGK isoenzymes that negatively regulate T cells through the diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling pathway. We first evaluated the effects of the DGKi in enhancing the efficacy of adoptive human T cell transfer in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mouse model and found that the DGKi significantly potentiated anti-tumor efficacy through multiple mechanisms, including increased intratumoral T cell infiltration, upregulation of genes associated with inflammatory responses, and reduction of TIL hypofunction, as evidenced by enhanced cytokine production following ex vivo anti-CD3 antibody stimulation. We next studied the effects of the DGKi on human TILs derived from tumor digests or studied ",
