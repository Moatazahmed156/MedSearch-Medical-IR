  "abstract": "To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at \"Sanyinjiao\" (SP6) and \"Zusanli\" (ST36) on the expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated γ receptor (PPAR-γ), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle of Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), so as to explore its possible mechanism in improving insulin resistance (IR). Eighteen male 2-month-old ZDF (Lepr Compared with the control group, the FBW, FBG, HOMA-IR index, the serum levels of FINS, FFA, LDL, TG, TC, TNF-α, C-peptide and CRP, NF-κB phosphorylation level, as well as the positive expression of TNF-α and p-NF-κB/NF-κB in skeletal muscle were increased ( EA can ameliorate energy metabolism disorders in T2DM rats, reduce ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle, and alleviate inflammatory responses, which may be related to the regulation of the PPAR-γ/NF-κB signaling pathway.",
