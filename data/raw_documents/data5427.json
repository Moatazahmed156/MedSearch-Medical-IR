    "abstract": "Benign ovarian tumors occur in 7% of women during their procreative years and involve both organic and functional tumors. The average age of onset for borderline ovarian tumors is ten years younger than that for ovarian cancers. Women with benign and borderline malignant ovarian tumors are therefore more likely to be affected by fertility issues. The causal link between infertility and benign ovarian tumor stems more from the therapeutic strategies adopted than from the histological nature of the benign ovarian tumor. The question of fertility preservation must therefore be addressed in the management of these patients through respect for \"correct\" surgical indications, through gestures centered around ovarian preservation, and finally, if necessary, by recourse to fertility preservation techniques.",
