  "title": "Body intelligence and nature: A convergence of Persian medicine and modern biophysics.",
  "abstract": "Physical intelligence refers to the capacity of living systems to sense, interpret, and respond adaptively to internal and external signals through integrated biochemical, bioelectrical, and biophysical processes. This conceptual review examines points of convergence between contemporary biophysical research, including biofield science, biophotonics, and systems neuroscience, and classical Persian Medicine (PM), particularly the framework of Tabi'at-e Modabbereh (the intelligent, governing nature), Arwah (spirits), Quwa (faculties), and Af'al (actions). Rather than equating traditional constructs with scientific entities, this paper identifies analogical parallels that may support new hypotheses on whole-system regulation. A critical appraisal of emerging evidence regarding energetic dysregulation and early disease patterns is included. The review concludes with specific, testable research questions aimed at advancing integrative biophysical-Persian Medicine models.",
