  "title": "Heightened prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome in U.S. sexual minorities.",
  "abstract": "To assess the prevalence and odds of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority individuals (LGB+) in the United States using a multi-year, nationally representative survey. We performed multivariate logistic regression of 2021-2023 National Health Interview Surveys to determine any relationship between LGB+ identity and CFS. Of 86,440 Americans, CFS was present in 1,489 [1.7%]. A higher proportion of LGB+ adults (2.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.21%-2.59%]) than non-LGB+ adults (1.7% [95% CI: 1.60%-1.80%] reported CFS (p = 0.002). After adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, education, employment, depression, and history of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia, LGB+ participants were more likely to report CFS than were heterosexuals (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12-1.92). LGB+ adults in the United States have a disproportionate prevalence and odds of CFS compared with heterosexual individuals.",
