  "title": "Interaction effects of environmental factors with white blood cell profiles on mycobacterial pulmonary diseases: a case-control study.",
  "abstract": "Mycobacterial pulmonary diseases remain a significant global health concern. This study investigates the interaction effects of relative humidity (RH), temperature, and fine particular matter (PM This case-control study of 1,398 participants, including 409 cases (203 DS-TB, 151 MDR-TB, and 55 NTM) and 989 controls, assessed individual exposure to RH, temperature, and PM Higher mean RH was associated with a 0.92-fold decreased OR for DS-TB (95% CI: 0.88, 0.96), while higher temperature daily difference and PM This study highlights the role of WBC profiles in modifying the relationship between short-term temperature exposure and mycobacterial pulmonary disease, underscoring the interplay between environmental triggers and immune profiles in disease pathogenesis. Understanding these associations may enhance strategies for TB prevention and early detection. Not applicable.",
