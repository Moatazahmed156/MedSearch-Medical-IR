  "title": "Systemic Inflammatory Indices (SII and SIRI) in 30-Day Mortality Risk Stratification for Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Study Alongside CURB-65 and PSI.",
  "abstract": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for accessible and cost-effective biomarkers to support early risk assessment. This retrospective study investigated the prognostic performance of two systemic inflammatory indices-the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) and the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI)-in 240 adults hospitalized with CAP between January and December 2024. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to compare these indices with established severity scores, CURB-65 and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 15.4% of patients. Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher SII values (",
