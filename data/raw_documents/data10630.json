  "abstract": "Selective antagonists of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a cation-selective ion channel, are promising therapeutics for neuropathic pain and asthma. High-resolution TRPA1 structures reveal lipid-facing transmembrane binding sites that require ligands to partition into membranes for access. However, the role of membrane adaptability remains unclear. We investigated GDC-0334, a potent TRPA1 antagonist, and three analogs in heterogeneous membranes using molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce ",
