  "title": "Comparing self-reported sleep quality and wearable-derived sleep metrics in middle-aged and older adults with chronic pain: a psychometric study.",
  "abstract": "Our primary aim is to evaluate the agreement between subjective and objective methods of measuring sleep quality in people with musculoskeletal pain and poor sleep. Our secondary aim is to explore the relationship between subjective and objective sleep quality in people with clinical and experimental pain, as well as its impact on function. Participants with musculoskeletal pain (intensity >5/10 most days over the preceding 3 months) and poor sleep [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) total > 5] ( PSQI responses for total bedtime ( This preliminary study provides valuable insights into the complementary roles of subjective and objective sleep assessments in older adults with chronic pain. The findings underscore the importance of integrating both approaches to refine sleep evaluation in individuals with musculoskeletal pain. Future research should further examine the feasibility and clinical utility of combining subjective and objective assessments to enhance understanding of sleep- and pain-related health outcomes.",
