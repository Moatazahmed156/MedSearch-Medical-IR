    "abstract": "Context:\n        \n      \n      A classification system for lower urinary tract system (LUTS) dysfunction, based on urodynamics, could support the evaluation and management of this pathological condition.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      A new alphanumerical classification system is proposed for staging neurogenic and non-neurogenic LUTS dysfunction, according to the urodynamic evaluation.\n    \n\n\n          Evidence acquisition:\n        \n      \n      This is a proposal based on experience from everyday clinical practice and represents an opinion open to discussion.\n    \n\n\n          Evidence synthesis:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this alphanumerical classification is the establishment of a simple, unified staging system describing all LUTS dysfunction situations, after a urodynamic evaluation, in a way that can help in diagnosis, treatment, health professionals' communication, education, and research.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This alphanumerical classification for LUTS dysfunction could become a unified standard and a prerequisite for ensuring the quality of care in all resource settings. Moreover, it would be useful for the future to include a classification as part of LUTS dysfunction registration.\n    \n\n\n          Patient summary:\n        \n      \n      A new alphanumerical classification system is presented. The purpose of this classification is the establishment of a simple, unified staging system describing entire lower urinary tract system dysfunction situations in a way that could help in diagnosis, treatment, health professionals' communication, education, and research.",
