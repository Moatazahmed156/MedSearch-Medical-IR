    "abstract": "Human guts harbor abundant microbes that regulate many aspects of host physiology. However, bacterial imbalance or dysbiosis in the gut due to the dietary or environmental changes may cause colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing studies show that gut microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC, as a result of virulence factors, bacterial metabolites, or inflammatory pathways. In the future, probiotics or targeting the microbiota will probably be a powerful weapon in the battle against CRC. This review seeks to outline the relationship between gut microbiota and the development of CRC as well as the potential mechanisms of microbiota involved in treatment of CRC, so as to provide some references for research on the development, prevention, and treatment of this disease.",
