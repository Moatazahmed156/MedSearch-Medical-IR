    "abstract": "Head and neck lymphedema (HNL) is an increasingly recognized complication of head and neck cancer and its treatment. However, no consensus exists on the \"gold-standard\" assessment tool for the purposes of diagnosis, classification, or monitoring of HNL. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding HNL assessment to determine the optimal method/s of assessment for patients with HNL. A review of publications between January 2000 and September 2021 was undertaken on four electronic databases. Studies were excluded if no clear assessment method of HNL was documented. Sixty-seven articles were included in the study. A wide range of assessment methods for HNL have been reported in the literature. For the purposes of diagnosis and classification of physical findings, computed tomography (CT) appears the most promising tool available for both external and internal HNL. In terms of monitoring, ultrasound appears optimal for external HNL, while a clinician-reported rating scale on laryngoscopy is the gold standard for internal HNL. Patient-reported assessment must be considered alongside objective methods to classify symptom burden and monitor improvement with treatment.",
