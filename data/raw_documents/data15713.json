  "title": "A qualitative exploration of critical issues limiting local vaccines production in Nigeria: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "abstract": "Vaccines are essential health interventions that have become a cost-effective tool for maintaining public health. Access to vaccines in Nigeria and other developing countries is, however, affected by various relevant issues, including insufficient supply, inequitable distribution, vaccine hesitancy, and a lack of local manufacturing capacity. This study, therefore, aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges impeding vaccine production in Nigeria, taking lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative study was undertaken using a purposive sampling strategy to recruit key stakeholders across Nigeria's vaccine value chain. Interviews were carried out using a semi-structured interview guide. Relevant stakeholders with varying levels of experience across the vaccine value chain were interviewed to ensure that robust and comprehensive data were obtained. The data collected were subjected to thematic analysis, following the interpretivist tradition. Throughout the study, trustworthiness was assured by adopting relevant processes such as data triangulation, reflexive and audit trails. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development Health Research Ethics Committee prior to the commencement of data collection. This study revealed eight thematic areas underpinning the gaps associated with local vaccine production in Nigeria. Challenges included limited capacity, inadequate research and development, infrastructure deficits, and a sub-optimal environment for vaccine development. Furthermore, the challenges associated with commercialisation and distribution were identified. Findings also revealed a lack of critical factors required for expediting vaccine manufacturing in Nigeria, including poor commitment to collaboration, an absence of sustainability policies and sub-optimal legislation. The study provides insight into systemic and structural barriers to local vaccine production in Nigeria. It identifies key areas requiring urgent intervention, which include funding, infrastructure, human capacity, and regulatory reform. Addressing these gaps through multi-level strategies is critical for improving vaccine self-sufficiency. Evidence from this study can help develop contextual strategies that will expedite vaccine production and Medicines' Security in Nigeria.",
