  "title": "Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: Focus on Dynamics and Electron Transport Chain.",
  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities and memory loss. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major factor in early pathological changes; however, its precise pathogenic mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Mitochondria are essential for neuronal energy generation, calcium ion balance regulation, apoptosis control, and production of reactive oxygen species. Among the various mitochondrial changes, the imbalance between fission and fusion is closely linked to β-amyloid deposition and tau pathology, forming a vicious cycle. The electron transport chain (ETC) produces more than 90% of cellular ATP and is damaged in AD. However, most studies simply refer to \"mitochondrial dysfunction\" in general terms without detailing specific changes in ETC complexes and their subunits. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of the dynamics and ETC complex dysfunction observed in AD for therapeutic targets.",
