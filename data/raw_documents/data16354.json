  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted seasonal paediatric respiratory infections due to widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions, sharply reducing viral circulation. This study aimed to compare paediatric viral acute respiratory infection (ARI) patterns and outcomes pre- and post-COVID-19 using hospital-based data from Oman. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Paediatric Emergency Department, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Muscat, Oman. Paediatric patients who underwent PCR testing for respiratory viruses before (December 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019) and after (April 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023) the pandemic. Quantitative data is presented as means ± standard deviations and qualitative data as frequencies and percentages. Absolute/percentage changes replaced t-tests. Chi-square tests compared categorical variables and multivariate logistic regression adjusted for confounders. A total of 1,077 patients were analysed with 555 pre-COVID-19 and 522 post-COVID-19 cases (-5.95%). When comparing these two time periods, the number of children under 6 months decreased (24.7% to 17.8%;  Post-COVID-19, paediatric ARIs worsened in severity and shifted in age distribution, with more influenza A and coinfections, demanding updated protocols and ongoing surveillance.",
