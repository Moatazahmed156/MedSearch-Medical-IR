    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are the mainstay treatment of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Unfortunately, metabolic side effects, drug interactions and adverse reactions commonly lead to glucocorticoid-related side effects, thereby compromising their intended anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The goal of this review is to help clinicians to monitor the broad spectrum of side effects of short-term systemic glucocorticoid administration, defined as glucocorticoid treatment shorter than 30 days. We review the various systems affected, with a focus on metabolic conditions and hyperglycaemia management.",
