  "title": "Characterization of Human Group 9 Innate Lymphoid Cells in Response to Allergen Immunotherapy in Patients With Allergic Rhinitis.",
  "abstract": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are classically divided into three groups: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 to reflect their functional analogy to Th1, Th2, and Th17. There is also an IL-9 single-producing T cell subset, namely the Th9 cell, which plays a dominant role in the onset of allergic diseases compared with traditional Th2 cells. Although a corresponding cell subset of ILCs to different Th cell subsets exists, so far the counterpart of Th9 cells in ILCs has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to report the existence of group 9 innate lymphoid cells (ILC9s) and characterize them in allergic rhinitis (AR) and in response to allergen immunotherapy. The expressions and characterization of ILC9s were investigated in purified ILCs cultures, PBMCs from patients with AR and responder subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) patients by flow cytometry, scRNA-seq transcriptome, qRT-PCR, siRNA knockdown, and immunofluorescence staining. IL-9-expressing cells were observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR without the co-expression of IL-5 and IL-13. IL-4 and TGF-β induce IL-9 secretion by human ILCs. scRNA-seq of whole ILCs defines an H1R ILC9s are highly expressed in the nasal mucosa and PBMCs of patients with AR and were decreased in response to house dust mite-SCIT. Our study sheds light on the newly discovered ILC9 subset and demonstrates a potential target in allergen immunotherapy.",
