  "title": "Efficiency of remote videoconference-assisted ultrasound education: comparison with standard classroom training.",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated innovative approaches to medical education. This proposed a particular challenge for the teaching of practical skills, such as ultrasound (US) training. This study compared the effectiveness of traditional classroom-based US training with that of remote training using teleguided US (Tele-US) among students in the Prehospital Critical Care (PHCC) program at the University of Stavanger, Norway. A total of 44 students were divided into two groups: one received standard classroom training, and the other received remote training because of pandemic restrictions. Both groups underwent a comprehensive one-day US course, including theoretical lectures and hands-on training sessions. Pre-course and post-course tests were used to assess theoretical knowledge, image and video interpretation skills, practical scanning techniques, and clinical decision-making. There was no significant difference in educational outcomes between the tele-US and classroom groups across all areas of evaluation. Tele-US appears to be a viable alternative to traditional classroom-based US education, especially in contexts requiring physical distancing or in geographically remote settings. Not applicable.",
