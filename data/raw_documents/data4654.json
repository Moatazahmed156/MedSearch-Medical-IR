    "abstract": "Classic stem cell biology approaches tailored specifically with lung biology in mind are needed to bring the field of lung stem cell biology up to speed with that in other tissues. The infrequent cellular turnover, the diversity of cell types, and the necessity of daily cell function in this organ must be considered in stem cell studies. Previous work has created a base from which to explore transplantation, label retention, and more sophisticated lineage-tracing schemes to identify and characterize stem cell populations in the normal lung. These approaches are also imperative for building on precedents set in other tissues in the exploration of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in lung cancers. Additionally, recent studies provide key leads to further explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate lung homeostasis. Here, we discuss strategies to advance the field of lung stem cell biology with an emphasis on developing new, lung-specific tools.",
