    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies and has a poor prognosis. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators of cancer development. Studies have shown that the dysregulation of lncRNAs is frequently observed in ovarian cancer and greatly contributes to malignant phenotypical changes. In this review, we provide perspectives on the involvement of lncRNAs in the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, invasion, metastasis and drug resistance of ovarian cancer based on recent discoveries. Then, we discuss the role of lncRNAs in predicting the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Finally, we provide insight into the potential of lncRNAs for evaluating the diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer.",
