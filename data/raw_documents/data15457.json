  "abstract": "The global burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action. Here, we report a comparative evaluation of four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from the amphibian peptide B1CTcu5, integrating experimental validation with molecular modeling to elucidate structure-activity relationships. Among them, W-B1CTcu5, featuring a single N-terminal tryptophan substitution, exhibited the most potent antimycobacterial activity (MIC = 3.2 μg/mL) against ",
