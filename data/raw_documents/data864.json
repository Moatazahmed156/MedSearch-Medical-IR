    "abstract": "We investigated roles of Lactobacillus johnsonii MG (MG) isolated from mice with interaction with tight junction on gut barrier function with Caco-2 cell model. Pretreatment with MG enhanced barrier function and showed protective effect against Enterococcus faecium provided damage. MG treatment increased the gene expressions of transcriptional regulator NFKB and major tight junction protein, ZO-1.",
