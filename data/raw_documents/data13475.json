  "title": "Tremor in Parkinson's Disease.",
  "abstract": "Tremor is one of the most visible and distressing symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), ranking high among patients' most bothersome features. While levodopa is the most effective pharmacological therapy, approximately half of patients report insufficient tremor control, and refractory tremor remains a major therapeutic challenge. The psychosocial impact of tremor is profound: its visibility leads to embarrassment, stigma, and emotional distress, while its interference with daily activities and professional life compounds disability. Prevalence studies suggest that nearly all individuals with PD experience tremor at some point, though its severity fluctuates over time and may plateau or improve in later disease stages. Tremor pathophysiology differs from bradykinesia and rigidity, involving both basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits, supporting the \"dimmer-switch\" model. Management strategies include dopaminergic and nondopaminergic medications, deep brain stimulation, and emerging interventions such as MR-guided focused ultrasound. Optimizing therapy remains crucial to alleviating tremor-related burden in PD.",
