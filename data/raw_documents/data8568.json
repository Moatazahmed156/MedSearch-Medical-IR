    "abstract": "Wound healing is a crucial process that restores the integrity and function of the skin and other tissues after injury. However, external factors, such as infection and inflammation, can impair wound healing and cause severe tissue damage. Therefore, developing new drugs or methods to promote wound healing is of great significance. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising technique that uses photothermal agents (PTAs) to convert near-infrared radiation into heat, which can eliminate bacteria and stimulate tissue regeneration. PTT has the advantages of high efficiency, controllability, and low drug resistance. Hence, nanomaterial-based PTT and its related strategies have been widely explored for wound healing applications. However, a comprehensive review of PTT-related strategies for wound healing is still lacking. In this review, we introduce the physiological mechanisms and influencing factors of wound healing, and summarize the types of PTAs commonly used for wound healing. Then, we discuss the strategies for designing nanocomposites for multimodal combination treatment of wounds. Moreover, we review methods to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PTT for wound healing, such as selecting the appropriate wound dressing form, controlling drug release, and changing the infrared irradiation window. Finally, we address the challenges of PTT in wound healing and suggest future directions.",
