  "title": "The Prevalence of Lung Carcinoma Among the Population in Bulgaria and Its Association with Radon Exposure in Residential Buildings.",
  "abstract": "Lung carcinoma remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with smoking as the primary risk factor and radon exposure as the second, and the first among non-smokers. The combined effect of tobacco smoke and indoor radon increases disease risk up to 2.5 times, emphasizing the need for prevention and environmental risk assessment. This study analyzed the incidence of lung carcinoma in Bulgaria during 2013-2022 and examined its association with indoor radon exposure across different regions. Annual data were obtained from the National Statistical Institute and the National Survey of Indoor Radon Concentrations in Residential Buildings (2015-2016). The average annual incidence was 43.5 per 100,000 population, showing a 3.4% annual decline, while the average prevalence was 131.7 per 100,000, decreasing by 1.4% per year. Considerable interregional variation was observed, with incidence ranging from 25.5 to 62.4 per 100,000. A moderate positive correlation was found between lung carcinoma incidence and mean indoor radon concentration, and a stronger to very strong correlation with the proportion of dwellings exceeding 300 Bq/m These findings indicate a positive association between residential radon exposure and lung cancer morbidity and support maintaining the WHO-recommended reference level of 200 Bq/m",
