    "abstract": "Introduction: Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies among women worldwide. The lack of early diagnostic markers fuels an unfavorable prognosis as most patients are at an advanced stage when the disease is diagnosed for the first time. The role of the kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family in ovarian cancer progression and prognosis has been thoroughly investigated in various studies. Most of these peptidases are upregulated in ovarian cancer tissue compared to normal ovarian tissue and their expression is linked to overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS). In this review, we address the clinical relevance of KLKs in ovarian cancer and their diagnostic potential.Areas covered: This review covers the expression and regulation of KLKs in ovarian cancer with focus on the prognostic and diagnostic potential, especially in liquid biopsies.Expert opinion: In ovarian cancer, several kallikrein-related peptidases are markedly expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Tumor-derived protease secretion results in elevated levels in serum and ascites. KLKs may thus serve as potential biomarkers alone or in combination with other serum tumor markers, such as Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125), for early detection and assessment of the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.",
