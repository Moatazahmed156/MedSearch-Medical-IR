  "title": "Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Mimicking Dementia in a Patient Treated With Imatinib.",
  "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the cornerstone of chronic myeloid leukemia treatment. Newer agents have more potency and a broader spectrum of action, but also a higher potential for neuropsychiatric side effects. We present a case of a patient on imatinib who developed progressive cognitive, mood, and behavioral alterations. He was investigated for dementia and psychiatric disorders but ultimately improved only after discontinuing imatinib. His decompensation years after therapy start, followed by complete and rapid remission, is atypical. We also review the most recent neurobiological findings on the role of tyrosine kinase alterations in dementia and their importance for mood regulation.",
