  "title": "Molecular Mechanism of Beta-Amyloid Aggregation Inhibition by KLVFF.",
  "abstract": "The accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers is a critical hallmark for different neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. The short peptide KLVFF, derived from the central hydrophobic domain of Aβ, binds to Aβ oligomers and interferes with Aβ aggregation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of action of this peptide remains to be elucidated. This work addresses this question by studying the interaction between an Aβ hexamer model and randomly positioned KLVFF peptides (",
