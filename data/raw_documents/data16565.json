  "title": "Smartphone-assisted upconversion nanoparticle assay for rapid multiplex detection of H5, H7, and H10 avian influenza viruses.",
  "abstract": "Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of the H5, H7, and H10 subtypes pose substantial threats to global public health owing to their high pathogenicity, cross-species transmissibility, and potential to spark epidemics. Rapid and accurate detection is essential for outbreak control and zoonotic risk mitigation. Here, we report the development of a multiplex lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) based on core-shell upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) conjugated with subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting the haemagglutinin proteins of H5, H7, and H10 AIVs. The assay achieved limits of detection of 0.0313, 0.0156, and 0.0625 ng/mL for recombinant HA proteins and 2",
