    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      There is ample evidence indicating that immunosuppressive therapy or immune dysregulation in systemic lupus erythematosus increases the risk for tuberculosis. Interestingly, a few case reports suggest that tuberculosis could also be a risk factor for systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      We report the case of a 32-year-old Indian patient who was co-diagnosed with tuberculosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune hepatitis without any history of prior immunosuppression. This stresses the complex relationship between tuberculosis and autoimmune diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Further research is warranted in this field to unfold the complex relationship between tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It is essential to establish clear guidelines for the management of coexisting tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus to promote individualized treatment.",
