    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      In China, although tremendous efforts has been made, the HIV/AIDS is still not controlled.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The study was carried out to determine the epidemic of HIV infection in Xi'an, analyse false positives (FP) risk factors and potential utility of sample-to-cutoff index to identify true positives using Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective review for HIV screening by Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo was performed in a teaching hospital in Xi'an between 2015 and 2016. The prevalence of HIV, positive predictive value (PPV) at different cut-off indexices (COI) were calculated. The epidemic of infections and risk factors for FP results were investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the study, the HIV prevalence and FP rate of Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo were 0.076 and 46.08%, respectively. The Han Chinese, males and people aged < 40 years accounted for the majority of infections (98.29, 76.07 and 73.5%, respectively). 85.47% of the infections were transmitted through sexual contact (35.04% of male homosexual and 50.43% of heterosexual). COI at 1-10, 10-30 and ≥ 30, the PPVs were 0, 50 and 100%, respectively. The independent risk factors for FP, i.e., pregnancy and malignancy had a statistically significant association with FP (p < 0.05), and age had a very strong statistically significant association with FP (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In Xi'an, sexual contact was the most important transmission mode for HIV, and the infections were predominantly identified in Han Chinese, males, young and middle-aged people. For Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo, it can achieve 100% of PPV with COI ≥30, and the age was strongly statistically associated with FP.",
