    "abstract": "Insufficient sleep duration is detrimental to health and performance and is alarmingly common in adolescents and young adults. The aim of this pre-registered meta-analysis was to determine the feasibility of at-home sleep extension as a means to improve sleep duration and daytime sleepiness, and maintain or improve sleep quality and efficiency, in adolescents and young adults. Peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations were screened to identify studies with at least five consecutive days of at-home sleep extension, pre- and post-extension measurement of sleep duration, and participants 13-30 years of age. Out of 2254 studies assessed for eligibility, 17 met review inclusion criteria - seven in adolescents and ten in young adults. At-home extension of sleep opportunity reliably increased sleep duration and sleep quality, and decreased daytime sleepiness when compared to unmanipulated sleep opportunity. These results indicate that at-home sleep extension is feasible in adolescents and young adults. However, the degree of improvement in sleep duration, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness varied by study population and sleep extension method, which will have downstream consequences for the effectiveness of sleep extension as an experimental manipulation and intervention to improve health and performance during adolescence and young adulthood.",
