    "abstract": "Cycling is an important form of exercise, recreation, and transportation. Following traumatic brain injury, the benefits of cycling for health, fitness, and community mobility must be considered alongside potential risk for recurrent injury. In addition to medical concerns and exercise tolerance, key domains include motor function, attention, and visuospatial and executive function, which have previously been explored with regard to driving. Cycling skill is a combination of cognitive and motor function, and can be trained with appropriate education and intervention. We discuss the relationship of brain injury rehabilitation to specific features of cycling, including case studies.",
