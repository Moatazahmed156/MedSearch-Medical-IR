    "abstract": "Optimizing maternal health in lower-resource settings requires a joint focus to simultaneously increase skilled delivery care access and improve the quality of preventive and emergency maternal health care provided. Evidence-based interventions are largely established, yet despite increasing access, poor quality is limiting health gains. Assessing quality and implementing quality improvement approaches across varied health system levels is imperative to address health priorities. Evaluations of maternal care quality improvement suggest the need for enhancing standardized monitoring strategies and identifying optimal implementation strategies for translating findings into practice within different lower-resource settings to increase adoption and sustainability.",
