  "title": "Proton pump inhibitor use and cardiovascular risk, all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality across baseline eGFR categories: a longitudinal study.",
  "abstract": "This longitudinal cohort study aimed to evaluate the associations of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. We analysed data from 30,362 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants (mean age: 49.3 ± 17.6 years; 51.1% women) between 2003 and 2018. Participants were categorised into eight subgroups based on PPI use and eGFR categories. CVD risk was assessed using survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression, while mortality was evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models over a median follow-up of 91 months. Analyses were adjusted for numerous potential confounders, with sensitivity analyses validating the results. Compared to nonusers with normal eGFR, PPI users with eGFR < 30 had the highest odds ratio (OR = 9.29, 95% CI: 3.34-25.81, ",
