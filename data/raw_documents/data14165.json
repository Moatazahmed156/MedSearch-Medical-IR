  "title": "Body Mass Index and Outcomes After Pilon Fracture Fixation: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "Pilon fractures of the distal tibial plafond account for 1% to 10% of all tibial fractures and are often associated with serious complications. As body mass index (BMI) is known to impact post-operative outcomes, particularly infection and nonunion, after trauma, the goal of this study is to explore these trends after pilon fractures. A single-center retrospective review of patients undergoing surgical fixation for pilon fractures between January 2013 and June 2023 was conducted. Only patients with at least a 6-month follow-up period were included. Demographic data and injury characteristics were extracted. Post-operative outcomes and complications were computed. Bivariate analysis via  There were 132 patients included. There was no significant relationship between BMI and infection rates, nonunion rates, and development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) on bivariate analysis ( BMI was not found to be an independent predictor of post-operative complications in patients with pilon fractures in this cohort. Our study suggests that pilon fractures are unique and counter historic lower-extremity injury postoperative care protocols that consider weight, although further investigation in larger cohorts with long-term follow-up is required to define this trend.
