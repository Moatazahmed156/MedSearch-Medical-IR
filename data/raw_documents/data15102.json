  "title": "Artificial intelligence in liver transplantation: Opportunities and challenges.",
  "abstract": "The management of liver transplant recipients and their outcome prediction is complex due to nonlinear interaction of multiple pre, peri and postoperative factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a potentially significant role in understanding and decision making at all stages of liver transplantation procedure. The role starts right from diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, followed by best course of action and prognostication. By analyzing numerous data points, AI can assist in the complex decision-making process of determining transplant candidacy. AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets of donor and recipient characteristics to improve the accuracy of matching, leading to better graft survival rates. This will help in optimizing the allocation of scarce organs, ensuring that they go to the most suitable recipients. AI can be used to predict the pre-operative risk factors and risk of post-operative complications such as graft rejection or post-transplant infections, allowing timely and tailored treatment. AI-powered imaging analysis can assist surgeons in preoperative planning and provide real-time guidance during surgery, increasing precision and improved safety. Therefore, AI has the potential to enhance long term patient and graft survival. The major challenges on use of AI are data availability, data quality, ethical considerations and clinical integration. In essence, AI holds great promise for revolutionizing liver transplantation albeit with some challenges.",
