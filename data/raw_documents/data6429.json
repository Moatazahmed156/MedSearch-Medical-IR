    "abstract": "Given the rapid aging of the population, age-related diseases have become an excessive burden on global health care. The kidney, a crucial metabolic organ, ages relatively quickly. While the aging process itself does not directly cause kidney damage, the physiological changes that accompany it can impair the kidney's capacity for self-repair. This makes aging kidneys more susceptible to diseases, including increased risks of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Therefore, delaying the progression of renal aging and preserving the youthful vitality of the kidney are crucial for preventing kidney diseases. However, effective strategies against renal aging are still lacking due to the underlying mechanisms of renal aging, which have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin has beneficial effects in mitigating renal aging. Metformin has shown promising anti-aging results in animal models but has not been tested for this purpose yet in clinical trials. These findings indicate the potential of metformin as an anti-renal aging drug. In this review, we primarily discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of kidney aging and the potential effects of metformin against renal aging.",
