    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a common event in aerobic organisms and a fundamental and unavoidable cost of the aerobic lifestyle. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and iron (Fe) are the most common agents that trigger oxidative stress. A conserved enzyme in the S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) metabolism, GSNO reductase (GSNOR), modulates a multitude of abiotic and biotic stress responses. In this review, we focus on the emerging role of GSNOR as a master regulator in oxidative stress through its regulation of the interaction of ROS, RNS, and Fe, and highlight recent discoveries in post-translational modifications of GSNOR and functional variations of natural GSNOR variants during oxidative stress. Recent advances in understanding GSNOR regulation show promise for the modulation of oxidative stress in plants.",
