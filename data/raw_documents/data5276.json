    "abstract": "The successful introduction of clean intermittent catheterization and increased awareness of urinary tract physiology and urodynamics have been the basis for recent major advances in urinary tract reconstructive surgery. Surgical techniques are now available to manage anatomical and functional deficiencies of any isolated or combined components of the urinary tract. The high incidence of unsatisfactory long-term results with ileal conduit diversion has led to increased popularity in urinary tract undiversion and greater utilization of reconstructive principles. As with any new surgical field of endeavour, new operative techniques are appearing at a rapid rate. In particular, there has been a recent proliferation of surgical procedures that provide a continent, low pressure, catheterizable reservoir for urine storage. Most children with major urinary tract deficiencies can now be offered socially and cosmetically unobtrusive surgical solutions without jeopardizing renal function.",
