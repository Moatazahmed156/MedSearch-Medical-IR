  "title": "Risk Factors and Preventing Strategies of Pocket Hematoma After Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Implantation: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Pocket hematoma is a common complication following cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation, traditionally perceived as a manageable local issue. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that clinically significant pocket hematoma (CSH) is strongly associated with increased infection rates, elevated healthcare costs, and heightened mortality. Key risk factors include advanced age, low body mass index (BMI), chronic kidney disease, complex procedures (device upgrades/replacements) and periprocedural antithrombotic management, particularly uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging strategies, which significantly elevate bleeding risk compared to continued vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) protocols. Novel compression devices and topical hemostatic agents show promise for prevention, while standardized definitions and risk stratification tools are urgently needed. This review synthesizes current evidence on multifactorial pathogenesis, adverse outcomes, and evolving preventive strategies for pocket hematoma, emphasizing its underappreciated clinical significance and the critical need for optimized periprocedural management in high-risk patients.",
