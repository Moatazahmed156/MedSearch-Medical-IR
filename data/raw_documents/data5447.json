    "abstract": "Gastric cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) recognized as a major etiological agent, affecting an estimated 50% of the world's population. There has been a rapidly expanding knowledge of the molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms of H. pylori over the decades. This review summarizes the latest research advances to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the H. pylori infection in gastric carcinogenesis. Our investigation of the molecular mechanisms reveals a complex network involving STAT3, NF-κB, Hippo, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are dysregulated in gastric cancer caused by H. pylori. Furthermore, we highlight the role of H. pylori in inducing oxidative stress, DNA damage, chronic inflammation, and cell apoptosis-key cellular events that pave the way for carcinogenesis. Emerging evidence also suggests the effect of H. pylori on the tumor microenvironment and its possible implications for cancer immunotherapy. This review synthesizes the current knowledge and identifies gaps that warrant further investigation. Despite the progress in our previous knowledge of the development in H. pylori-induced gastric cancer, a comprehensive investigation of H. pylori's role in gastric cancer is crucial for the advancement of prevention and treatment strategies. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to provide a more in-depth insights for the study and prevention of H. pylori-related gastric cancer.",
