  "abstract": "Accurate lung cancer prediction from CT scans using advanced deep learning methods is crucial for improving early diagnosis and treatment outcomes, as it harnesses innovative algorithms to enhance the detection and classification of malignant lesions in imaging data. The comprehensive approach for accurate lung cancer prediction from CT scans using advanced deep learning methods. Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, emphasizing the need for early and precise diagnosis. They propose a multistage framework that integrates state-of-the-art techniques, including hybrid Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for image segmentation, followed by an innovative feature extraction pipeline utilizing Capsule Networks (CapsNets), Siamese Neural Networks, and Hybrid Deep Autoencoders. This combination allows for the effective identification of lung regions and the detection of potential lesions, ensuring high segmentation accuracy and robustness against noise. The feature extraction implements a refined classification strategy that merges a Hybrid CNN-Transformer Model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This dual approach leverages CNNs for capturing local patterns and transformers for modelling long-range dependencies, enhancing the ability to recognize subtle features indicative of malignancies. GNNs further contribute by modelling spatial and relational information among extracted features, facilitating a deeper understanding of the lung's complex anatomic structures. The proposed technique also leads with 91%, compared with LSTM's 80%, FNN's 70%, and RNN's 70%, highlighting its ability to minimize false positives, implemented using Python software. The future scope for accurate lung cancer prediction from CT scans using advanced deep learning methods includes the development of more sophisticated algorithms that integrate multimodal imaging data, enhancing diagnostic precision, and personalization of treatment plans.",
