    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is regarded as one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer. Gut microbiota is vital to retain and promote several functions of intestinal. Although previous researches have shown that some gut microbiota have the abilities to inhibit tumorigenesis and prevent cancer from progressing, they have not yet clearly identified associative mechanisms. This review not only concentrates on the antitumor effects of metabolites produced by gut microbiota, for example, SCFA, ferrichrome, urolithins, equol and conjugated linoleic acids, but also the molecules which constituted the bacterial cell wall have the antitumor effect in the host, including lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, β-glucans and peptidoglycan. The aim of our review is to develop a possible therapeutic method, which use the products of gut microbiota metabolism or gut microbiota constituents to help treat or prevent colorectal cancer.",
