    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Macrodontia is a rare dental anomaly, and isolated macrodontia is even more infrequent. The aim of this article is to report on a young male patient with macrodontia of the mandibular premolars.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      We herein present a case report of a young male patient receiving pharmacological growth hormone therapy for 10 years, who was diagnosed with macrodontia of the mandibular premolars. The patient underwent surgical treatment at the School of Dentistry of the University of Buenos Aires and was followed-up for more than 3 years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Macrodontia is a rare condition. Early diagnosis and treatment of this anomaly favors adequate formation of the dental arches. In the light of this case report, a review of paediatric patients who received growth hormone therapy during the tooth formation stage would seem relevant.",
