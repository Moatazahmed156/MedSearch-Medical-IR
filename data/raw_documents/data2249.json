    "abstract": "Visual perception is humans' preferred way for taking information on the surrounding world. Visual perception is frequently impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease, lessening patients' quality of life, and making evaluation of other cognitive deficits more complicated. Our review covers the recent literature describing visual perception deficits in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease by classifying them according to their neuroanatomical correspondence: retina, visual pathway, subcortical structures, occipital visual cortex, occipito-temporal \"what\" and occipito-parietal \"where\" pathways. Overall, both low-level and high-level visual perception disorders seem quite common in Alzheimer's disease, including, on a low-level, loss of visual field, decreased acuity and contrast sensitivity, and impaired color vision, and on a high-level, impaired color vision, motion perception, visuospatial deficits, object agnosia, prosopagnosia and impaired recognition of facial emotional expressions. Professionals working with Alzheimer's disease should be aware of visuoperceptual deficits, which could impair the quality of life of the patients, and distort the results of neuropsychological tests using visual material. Moreover, some tests assessing visual perception could be of interest for early diagnosis of the disease.",
