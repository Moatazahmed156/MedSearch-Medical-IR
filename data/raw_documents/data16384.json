  "title": "Identification and characterization of a novel inhibitor of influenza A virus that acts by blocking nucleoprotein oligomerization.",
  "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics of acute respiratory infections resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Although approved influenza antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir and baloxavir) exist, concerns persist about the potential for emergence of drug-resistant variants, highlighting the continuing need for new antiviral therapies. Here, we describe the development of an orally bioavailable, direct-acting antiviral (VNT-101) with a novel mechanism of action: disrupting homo-oligomerization of the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Selection of drug-resistant mutants revealed amino acid substitutions mapping to the oligomerization domain of NP, and X-ray crystallography co-structure determination of VNT-101 complexed with recombinant NP confirmed VNT-101 binding in the oligomerization pocket. Biochemical experiments using size exclusion chromatography confirmed disruption of oligomerization when this chemotype is added to preparations of recombinant NP ",
