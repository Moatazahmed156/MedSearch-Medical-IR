  "title": "Effects of neuromuscular breathing exercise with yogic practices on cardiopulmonary variables among women asthmatic patients: A randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "Asthma is a respiratory disorder marked by airway obstruction, difficulty breathing, cough, and agitation. The intention of this research was to investigate the effects of neuromuscular breathing exercise with yogic practices on cardiopulmonary variables and asthma control among women asthmatic patients. To achieve the purpose of that investigation, 80 women asthma patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the yoga practice group (YPG) and the control group (CG). The YPG was involved in 1 h of yogic practice five days a week for a duration of 16 weeks, along with consistent taking of medications. The CG did not receive any practice and continued their regular medications. After 16 weeks, both groups underwent spirometry (PFT) and sphygmomanometer assessment. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were obtained from spirometry and blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer. Asthma control was assessed through ACT questionnaire. The statistical tools used for the study were the paired t-test and independent t-test. The yogic practices group revealed significant improvements in all cardiopulmonary variables at a confidence level p < 0.001 with a large effect size compared to the control group. Combined neuromuscular breathing exercise and yogic practices significantly enhanced cardiopulmonary functions and asthma control among women with mild persistent asthma. Yoga should be practiced continuously as an alternative or supplementary therapy to improve pulmonary function and overall well-being in people with asthma.",
