    "abstract": "Ankle impingement syndromes are a commonly encountered clinical entity seen in athletes, secondary to repetitive forceful microtrauma. Symptoms are related to impingement of osseous or soft tissue abnormalities in the ankle joint, in particular the tibiotalar joint, which may result in painful limitation of ankle movements. Imaging modalities, such as radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging, are very useful in diagnosing osseous and soft tissue abnormalities seen in different types of ankle impingement syndromes. This article reviews the classification of ankle impingement syndromes, their etiology, and clinical and radiological findings.",
