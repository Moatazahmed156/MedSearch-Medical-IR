    "abstract": "This review addresses the role of tight junction proteins at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Their expression is described, and their role in physiological and pathological processes at the BBB is discussed. Based on this, new approaches are depicted for paracellular drug delivery and diagnostics in the treatment of cerebral diseases. Recent data provide convincing evidence that, in addition to its impairment in the course of diseases, the BBB could be involved in the aetiology of CNS disorders. Further progress will be expected based on new insights in tight junction protein structure and in their involvement in signalling pathways.",
