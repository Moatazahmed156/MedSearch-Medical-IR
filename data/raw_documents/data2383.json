    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas publication first described the genomic landscape of endometrial cancer and characterized these cancers into four molecular subtypes with different prognoses. The Proactive Molecular Classifier for Endometrial Cancer was developed to more easily and inexpensively classify endometrial cancers into four similar molecular subtypes which are termed POLE, mismatch repair deficient, p53 abnormal and no specific molecular profile. Beyond these four subtypes, other molecular biomarkers may influence clinical behavior and response to targeted therapies and include beta-catenin, Her2 amplification, PI3K/mTOR/AKT alterations, L1CAM, hormone receptor expression, tumor mutational burden, and ARID1A. There are numerous clinical trials exploring treatment escalation and de-escalation within the four molecular subtypes as well as matching targeted therapies to specific mutational or biomarker profiles. All endometrial cancers should undergo basic molecular classification that includes assessment of mismatch repair status. POLE and p53 status are prognostic and may become actionable in the future. Clinicians who treat patients with endometrial cancer should understand the role of molecular classification in guiding treatment. The goal of this practice statement is to guide appropriate testing, interpretation, and application of molecular information in endometrial cancer.",
