  "abstract": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings. This hospital-based observational study investigated the etiology, seasonal trends, and co-infections of respiratory pathogens using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel among children under five from Eastern India. From January to December 2024, 209 samples (nasopharyngeal swabs/throat swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage) were collected from children under five who visited a tertiary healthcare center at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, with ARI/severe ARI (SARI). Multiplex PCR was used to identify the pathogens. All the data were recorded in a pre-designed case record form and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Overall, 59.8% (125/209) tested positive for viral pathogens, predominantly human rhinovirus (HRV, 21.05%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 16.26%). Bacterial pathogens were detected in 45.45% (95/209), primarily  The findings underscore HRV and ",
