    "abstract": "Physical activity has known health benefits and is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in the general population. Relatively few data are available for physical activity in kidney transplant recipients. Compared to the general population, physical activity levels are lower overall in kidney recipients, although somewhat higher compared to the dialysis population. Recipient comorbid condition, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, and long-term immunosuppression use negatively affect physical activity. Physical inactivity in kidney recipients may be associated with reduced quality of life, as well as increased mortality. Interventions such as exercise training appear to be safe in kidney transplant recipients and are associated with improved quality of life and exercise capacity. Additional studies are required to evaluate long-term effects on cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately cardiovascular disease outcomes and patient survival. Currently available data are characterized by wide variability in the interventions and outcome measures investigated in studies, as well as use of small sample-sized cohorts. These limitations highlight the need for larger studies using objective and standardized measures of physical activity and physical fitness in kidney transplant recipients.",
