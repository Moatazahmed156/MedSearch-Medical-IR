    "abstract": "Case report: A 79-year-old woman presented with a large painful ulcer on the lateral aspect of her left leg over a 6-month period and was diagnosed of ulcerated atrophie blanche. On an outpatient basis punch grafting was performed and 3 weeks after, complete epithelization was achieved. Discussion: Ulcerated atrophie blanche is a misdiagnosed disorder with painful lesions and, consequently, a high impact on quality of life. Atrophie blanche describes porcelain-white colored, red-dotted atrophic plaques on legs or feet. It may be due to multiple causes, usually associated with alterations in the microcirculation. All causes of atrophie blanche can be included in the term livedoid vasculopathy, a type of occlusive vasculopathy without vasculitis. Many patients with atrophie blanche and livedoid vasculopathy have also chronic venous insufficiency. Etiological treatment should be prescribed in order to avoid progression of the lesions. In case of chronic venous insufficiency, control of venous hypertension is essential. Without anti-edema measures, superficial, very painful, and resistant ulcers may appear. These ulcers can be considered a wound on scar tissue; therefore, it must be treated as a hard-to-heal wound. As we show in this case, punch grafting is an effective therapeutic alternative for wound closure and pain reduction of ulcerated atrophie blanche.",
