  "title": "Observational cohort study on physical activity patterns and coronary artery calcification among middle-aged adults.",
  "abstract": "The relationship between physical activity patterns and coronary artery calcification (CAC) among 132 middle-aged adults aged 40-60 years is of interest. Participants were followed over a 2-year period with baseline and follow-up coronary CT scans and activity tracking. Results showed that moderate to high physical activity was significantly associated with lower CAC progression. Sedentary behavior correlated with higher baseline CAC scores and greater progression over time. Thus, we show the importance of sustained physical activity in mitigating early atherosclerotic changes.",
