    "abstract": "Besides its involvement in blood and bone physiology, the kidney's main function is to filter substances and thereby regulate the electrolyte composition of body fluids, acid-base balance and toxin removal. Depending on underlying conditions, the nephron must undergo remodeling and cellular adaptations. The proteolytic removal of cell surface proteins via ectodomain shedding by A Disintegrin and Metalloproteases (ADAMs) is of importance for the regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion of renal cells. ADAM10 controls glomerular and tubule development in a Notch1 signaling-dependent manner and regulates brush border composition. ADAM17 regulates the renin angiotensin system and is together with ADAM10 involved in calcium phosphate homeostasis. In kidney disease ADAMs, especially ADAM17 contribute to inflammation through their involvement in IL-6 trans-signaling, Notch-, epithelial growth factor receptor-, and tumor necrosis factor α signaling. ADAMs are interesting drug targets to reduce the inflammatory burden, defective cell adhesion and impaired signaling pathways in kidney diseases.",
