    "abstract": "\"Numb chin syndrome\" (NCS) refers to new-onset numbness of the lower lip and chin within the distribution of the mental or inferior alveolar nerves. While this focal numbness may be downplayed or even overlooked by patients and clinicians, in the right clinical scenario this may be the presenting symptom of an underlying malignancy. In the absence of any obvious, temporally related dental cause, there are certain conditions that clinicians should consider including orofacial and systemic malignancies as well as several inflammatory disorders. Thorough diagnostic evaluation should always be performed when no clear cause is evident. This paper will discuss the differential, recommended evaluations, and the prognosis, for a patient presenting with NCS.",
