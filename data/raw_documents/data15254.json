  "abstract": "Granulomas, the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB) disease, can both restrict  Our understanding of immune mechanisms within the TB granuloma has advanced greatly with the advent of high-resolution single cell multiplexed imaging. Using such imaging, we show that TB granulomas in rhesus macaques, a highly translational model of human TB pathology, are characterized by IDO1-mediated immunoregulation. Early pharmacologic restoration of mTOR signaling via D-1MT treatment can reduce IDO1 enzymatic activity and facilitate the recruitment and function of CD8 ",
