  "abstract": "Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which effective treatments remain limited, and objective diagnostic and therapeutic assessment tools using biomarkers or neuroimaging are still lacking compared with human Alzheimer's disease. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a long-acting donepezil depot injection in dogs with CCD, using behavioral scores and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) as primary outcomes, with baseline MRI for diagnostic support. Thirty-two dogs with clinically diagnosed CCD were randomly assigned to a high-dose group (",
