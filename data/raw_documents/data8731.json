    "abstract": "Due to an increasingly better understanding of the human genome, the number of potential molecular targets, and therefore, potential applications by gene therapies is also increasing. After almost two decades of basic research, the first gene therapeutics are now entering the market. They are among the most expensive types of treatment in medicine. Over the next 10 years, the number and volume of their applications will increase significantly. So, our healthcare systems and inherently health insurance companies will face considerable challenges that will require new approaches to financial solutions. This article first describes the mode of action of the first gene therapies of cancer and their by now known side effects. Subsequently, the cost problems are dealt with and possible financing options are pointed out.",
