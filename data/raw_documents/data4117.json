This case report presents a successful management of AI using fixed orthodontic appliances and prosthodontic rehabilitation.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) causes enamel defects, complicating oral hygiene, reducing masticatory function and lowering self-esteem. This case report details an 18-year-old female with AI who underwent fixed orthodontic treatment followed by prosthodontic rehabilitation. The multidisciplinary approach restored function and aesthetics, significantly improving her quality of life.",
