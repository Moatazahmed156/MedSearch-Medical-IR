    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Ovarian cancer, characterized by metastasis and reduced 5-year survival rates, stands as a substantial factor in the mortality of gynecological malignancies worldwide. The challenge of delayed diagnosis originates from vague early symptoms and the absence of efficient screening and diagnostic biomarkers for early cancer detection. Recent studies have explored the intricate interplay between ovarian cancer and protein glycosylation, unveiling the potential significance of glycosylation-oriented biomarkers.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      This review examines the progress in glycosylation biomarker research, with particular emphasis on advances driven by mass spectrometry-based technologies. We document milestones achieved, discuss encountered limitations, and also highlight potential areas for future research and development of protein glycosylation biomarkers for ovarian cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      The association of glycosylation in ovarian cancer is well known, but current research lacks desired sensitivity and specificity for early detection. Notably, investigations into protein-specific and site-specific glycoproteomics have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of ovarian cancer and facilitate the identification of glycosylation-based biomarkers. Furthermore, the integration of advanced mass spectrometry techniques with AI-driven analysis and glycome databases holds the promise for revolutionizing biomarker discovery for ovarian cancer, ultimately transforming diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.",
