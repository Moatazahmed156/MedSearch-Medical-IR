  "abstract": "Skeletal muscle has an innate ability to restore damaged muscle fibers by contributing specific progenitor cells, called muscle satellite cells. Here we show that secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A1, a tumor suppressor gene in various malignancies including rhabdomyosarcoma, is induced just after muscle injury and contributes to damaged muscle fiber regeneration. Lineage tracing of SCGB3A1 in mice show that SCGB3A1-positive cells highly express myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-IIX in damaged fiber area. Scgb3a1-null and Pax7",
