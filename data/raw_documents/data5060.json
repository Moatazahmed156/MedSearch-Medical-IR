    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant diseases worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Accumulating evidences suggest that immunotherapy could be a promising option for treating HCC. T cell-associated immunotherapy lights up the hope for the improvement of complementary approach to conventional HCC treatments, which needs further research to consummate the clinical consequences. The present work reviewed several T cells associated cellular immunotherapies for HCC, including immune checkpoint blockade, gene-engineered T cells, bispecific T cell engagers, and so on. We also analyzed how these immunotherapies can mediate tumor cell eradication and evaluated their superiority or insufficiency.",
