  "abstract": "Astragali Radix (Huangqi), a traditional Chinese medicine documented in Shennong Bencao Jing (ca. 200 AD), has been used for chronic liver disease. Total astragalus saponins (TAS), its primary bioactive component, exhibit anti-fibrotic effects. However, their potential synergy with stem cell therapy remains unexplored. To investigate whether TAS enhances the therapeutic efficacy of Numb-overexpressing human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs  CLF was induced in rats by bile duct ligation, post-surgery, rats received hUC-MSCs  Combined TAS and hUC-MSCs  TAS synergistically enhances the anti-CLF efficacy of hUC-MSCs ",
