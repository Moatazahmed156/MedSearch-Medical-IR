    "abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a diagnosis based on a constellation of clinical features of edema (peau d'orange) of a third or more of the skin of the breast with a palpable border and a rapid onset of breast erythema. Incidence of IBC has increased over time, although it still makes up only 1-4% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Despite recent encouraging data on clinical outcomes, the published local-regional control rates remain consistently lower than the rates for non-IBC. In this review, we focus on radiotherapy, provide a framework for multi-disciplinary care for IBC, describe local-regional treatment techniques for IBC; highlight new directions in the management of patients with metastatic IBC and offer an introduction to future directions regarding the optimal treatment and management of IBC.",
