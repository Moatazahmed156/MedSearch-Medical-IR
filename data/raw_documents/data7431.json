    "abstract": "The concepts of hematopoiesis and the generation of blood and immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells are some steady concepts in the field of hematology. However, the knowledge of hematopoietic cells arising from solid tumor cancer stem cells is novel. In the solid tumor microenvironment, hematopoietic cells play pivotal roles in tumor growth and progression. Recent studies have reported that solid tumor cancer cells or cancer stem cells could differentiate into hematopoietic cells. Here, we discuss efforts and research that focused on the presence of hematopoietic cells in tumor microenvironments. We also discuss hematopoiesis from solid tumor cancer stem cells and clarify the notion of differentiation of solid tumor cancer stem cells into non-cancer hematopoietic stem cells.",
