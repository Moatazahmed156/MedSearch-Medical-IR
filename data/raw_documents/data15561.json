  "title": "The Prevalence of Polymorphism in Vitamin D Receptor Genes and its Correlation with Susceptibility to Pulmonary Tuberculosis in the Global Population (2010-2023): A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene play a significant role in the susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Recognition of these polymorphisms is a crucial aspect of TB treatment. This study aims to investigate the effects of VDR gene polymorphisms on TB susceptibility. This research encompassed studies from 2010 to 2023. The synthesis and integration of data, along with meta-analysis and qualitative heterogeneity investigation, were conducted using a documentation table. STATA 14 software was employed for meta-analysis, utilizing both the fixed and random effects models. To assess data heterogeneity, the Q test ( The highest pooled OR of genotype polymorphism of the VDR gene was associated with the FF (OR: 1.165, 95% CI; 0.953- 1.424), TT (OR: 1.163, 95% CI; 1.018- 1.329), Tt (95% CI: 0.768-1.095) and tt (95% CI: 0.594-1.416) each one OR: 0.917, Ff (OR: 0.888, 95% CI; 0.699- 1.130, weight: 100.00) and ff (OR: 0.648, 95% CI; 0.418- 1.006, weight: 100.00), respectively. The statistical difference between case and control groups was found to be significant in terms of TT genotype ( The FF and TT genotypes exhibited the highest prevalence of polymorphism.",
