    "abstract": "This research was conducted to investigate the relationship between women's attitudes toward sexuality during pregnancy and their body image and to determine the predictors of pregnant women's sexual attitudes. The research was conducted with 515 pregnant women in Turkey. Study data were collected using a sociodemographic data form, the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, and the Body Image in Pregnancy Scale. As women's positive attitudes toward sexuality increased, their dissatisfaction with their body image decreased. It was determined that women with a positive body image during pregnancy had a less anxious attitude toward sexual intercourse, developed positive beliefs and values toward sexuality, and approved of sexuality during pregnancy. The factors that explained 15.8% of pregnant women's attitudes towards sexuality were body image, age, gestational week, satisfaction with sexuality during pregnancy, and knowledge of sexuality during pregnancy. It is recommended that body image, age, gestational week, satisfaction with sexuality in pregnancy and knowledge of sexuality in pregnancy should be taken into consideration in order to accurately determine the sexual attitudes of pregnant women in obstetric clinics.",
