    "abstract": "This study compares the psychiatric, neurological, and psychoeducational status of sexually assaultive male juveniles and other violent juveniles. The authors found that juvenile sexual assaulters suffered from neuropsychiatric problems similar to those of other violent juveniles, had committed violent acts other than sexual assault, and had had seriously aberrant behavior since early childhood. The findings contradict prevailing assumptions that sexual assaults by juveniles are rare occurrences and that juvenile sex offenders have low rates of recidivism. Theoretical and treatment implications are discussed.",
