  "title": "Effect and mechanism of chemokine receptor 1 in airway inflammation in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
  "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) in airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mice. We established a mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD. A mouse model with CCR1 overexpression or silencing COPD was established by tail vein injection of CCR1 overexpression lentivirus or shRNA-CCR1 lentivirus. Pathological changes in the bronchial mucosa were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. CCR1 expression and cell apoptosis were detected  Compared with the COPD mice, the bronchial mucosa of the COPD model mice transfected with the vector showed apoptosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, airway remodeling, and emphysema. The COPD model mice exhibited significantly increased expression levels of p-IKK, p-JAK2, STAT3, and p-p65 and chemokine concentrations (MIP-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) than the control mice ( CCR1 aggravates the progression of COPD mice by activating JAK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling. This study has the potential to provide theoretical evidence for the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies of cigarette smoke-induced inflammation in COPD patients. CCR1 deficiency or BX471 treatment can alleviate the progression of COPD in the mouse model.CCR1 overexpression increases apoptosis in lung tissues of COPD mice.CCR1 overexpression activates JAK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling in the bronchial mucosa of COPD mice.CCR1 overexpression increases the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and MIP-1β in BALF of COPD mice.",
