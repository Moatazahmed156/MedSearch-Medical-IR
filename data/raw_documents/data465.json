    "abstract": "The number of older people in UK prisons has increased significantly in recent years and most of them have at least one health condition. Research has shown that the physical and mental health of older people living in the community is positively correlated with resilience, but there is limited research on how to promote resilience in older prisoners. This systematic literature review offers a synthesis of interventions, practices and processes that may improve resilience in older prisoners. The review included eight peer-reviewed studies and identified three elements that support resilience in older prisoners: organised interventions; relational activities; and subjective processes. Healthcare professionals working in prisons can use the findings to identify how to support older prisoners' well-being and develop the conditions that may enable older prisoners to sustain and strengthen their resilience.",
