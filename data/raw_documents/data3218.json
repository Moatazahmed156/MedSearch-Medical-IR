    "abstract": "This case describes a young white British man with a one-year history of recurrent genital ulceration managed by the GP. Initially this was thought to be a drug reaction; however, presentation at our genitourinary medicine clinic and onward review with dermatology allowed the diagnosis of Behçet's disease to be made. The clinical diagnosis was made based on painful oral and genital ulcers, eye irritation, erythema nodosum and positive pathergy test. Treatment with oral prednisolone was initiated by dermatology, which resulted in rapid improvement in the genital ulceration. This case highlights that clinicians should consider Behçet's disease in patients with recurrent genital ulceration to ensure prompt diagnosis and prevention of systemic involvement.",
