    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents an unprecedented global health crisis. Safe and effective vaccines were rapidly developed and deployed that reduced COVID-19-related severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not at increased risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19, and data from large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective. Ongoing research is clarifying the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with inflammatory bowel disease, long-term immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination, and optimal timing for repeated COVID-19 vaccination doses.",
