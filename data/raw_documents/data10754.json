  "title": "A causal inference study on the impact of asthma on the onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: two-sample Mendelian randomization.",
  "abstract": "Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two common respiratory ailments with an overlapping pathogenesis. In this study, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach and analyzing publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets, we explored the causal impact of asthma on the onset of COPD. Results: Using genetic instrumental variables associated with asthma ( This study provides robust evidence supporting the causal link between asthma and COPD, offering a more comprehensive understanding of their relationship.",
