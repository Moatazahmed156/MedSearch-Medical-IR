  "title": "Usual Interstitial Pneumonia and Lung Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a notable association between interstitial lung diseases, particularly usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and lung cancer. This study investigates the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, histological findings, and treatment implications of this relationship. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Pneumology of Hassan II University Hospital in Fez, Morocco, from January 2016 to September 2024. Patient records of those with established UIP/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who developed lung cancer during follow-up, as well as lung cancer patients discussed in thoracic oncology multidisciplinary meetings with UIP pattern identified on CT, were reviewed. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, radiological and histological findings, treatment, and outcomes were collected and analyzed using Epi Info version 7.2.6.0. Results In total, 10 male patients with UIP and lung cancer were included, with a mean age of 66.2 years. Cough 8 (80%) and dyspnea 7 (70%) were the most common symptoms. Radiologically, 7 (70%) had definite UIP, and tumors were predominantly located in the lower lobes. Histological analysis revealed an equal distribution of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma at four (40%) each, with six (60%) patients diagnosed at stage IV. Treatment varied, with one patient undergoing surgery, while others received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Unfortunately, four patients died, highlighting the aggressive nature of the disease. Conclusions The association between UIP and lung cancer presents significant clinical challenges, impacting treatment strategies and survival outcomes. Continued research is vital to developing effective management protocols. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize care for patients facing the dual burden of UIP and lung cancer, ultimately aiming to improve their prognosis and quality of life.",
