    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate effectiveness of an educational intervention on pregnant women's nutritional knowledge. Despite national guidelines, women face personal and healthcare barriers to adequate nutrition education. This quasi-experimental study involved a convenience sample of pregnant women (n=27). The Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (NKQ) was utilized for pre and post-tests. Additionally, participants were asked open-ended questions. Data analysis was performed using paired t-tests, linear regression, and qualitative thematic analysis. The mean pre-test and post-test scores on the NKQ were 30.0 and 38.96 respectively, representing a statistically significant increase (p≤0.00). Six qualitative themes emerged including nutrition as \"important\" and \"a real eye opener.\" This study validates the use of an educational intervention based on MyPlate guidelines to increase pregnant women's knowledge of nutrition.",
