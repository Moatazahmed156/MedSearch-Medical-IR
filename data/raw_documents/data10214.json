  "title": "Distribution of Allergy Diagnoses and Cardiometabolic Comorbidities Among Older Adults with EHR-Recorded Allergic Diseases - A Single-Center Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "Allergic diseases are frequently underdiagnosed in older adults due to overlapping symptoms with other chronic conditions and age-related changes in the immune system. As the elderly population continues to grow, understanding the prevalence and clinical impact of allergic diseases in this group is essential. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of common allergic conditions in individuals aged 65 and older and to examine their associated comorbidities. We conducted a retrospective chart review of approximately 17,000 patients aged 65 and older who were diagnosed with allergic diseases between January 2020 and December 2023. Data on age, sex, race/ethnicity, specific allergic diagnoses, and comorbid medical conditions were extracted from electronic health records and analyzed descriptively. Allergic rhinitis and asthma were the most prevalent allergic conditions, affecting 51.2% and 50.3% of the study population, respectively. Food allergies were identified in 8.4% of patients, contact dermatitis in 4.5%, and atopic dermatitis in 2.9%. Comorbidities were most frequent among patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity overall, affecting 77.7% of patients with allergic rhinitis and 77.2% with asthma, followed by coronary artery disease. Rates of allergic disease were higher among patients aged 65-75 compared to those over 75, and prevalence was generally higher in women than in men. Allergic conditions, particularly allergic rhinitis and asthma, are common in older adults and often coexist with cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for increased clinical awareness and tailored diagnostic approaches in elderly populations to avoid missed or delayed diagnoses and to improve management outcomes. As people live longer, healthcare systems are caring for more adults over the age of 65. While allergies are often thought of as a childhood or young adult issue, they can remain a problem well into older age. In fact, symptoms like sneezing, itchy skin, or breathing problems can be due to allergies, even in people in their 70s and 80s. However, these symptoms are often overlooked because they can also be caused by other health conditions that are common in older adults, such as high blood pressure or heart disease. In this study, we reviewed the medical records of over 16,000 patients aged 65 and older to find out how common allergies really are in this age group. We focused on conditions like allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, food allergies, and types of skin inflammation. We also looked at other health problems they might have, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. We found that more than half of older adults in the cohort had allergic rhinitis or asthma. These conditions were especially common in people who also had other chronic illnesses. High blood pressure was the most common overlapping condition. These findings show that allergies are not rare in older adults and that they often occur alongside other health issues. Doctors should consider allergies more often in older patients to ensure accurate diagnoses and better treatment plans. Recognizing these conditions can lead to healthier, more comfortable lives for many seniors.",
