  "title": "Coronary CTA in Contemporary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: From Diagnostic Modality to Decision-Making Toolkit.",
  "abstract": "Percutaneous coronary intervention outcomes rely heavily on accurate lesion assessment and procedural planning. Invasive tools, such as fractional flow reserve, nonhyperemic pressure ratios, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography, provide essential physiological and anatomic insights but are resource-intensive, prolong procedures, and increase contrast and radiation exposure. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography has emerged as a noninvasive modality with high diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease, capable of detailing plaque composition, lesion length, and vessel geometry. With the integration of CT-derived fractional flow reserve and CT myocardial perfusion imaging, coronary CT angiography now offers both anatomic and functional evaluation, bridging diagnostic and interventional decision-making. Despite guideline endorsement for coronary artery disease diagnosis, its role in guiding percutaneous coronary intervention strategies remains underutilized and absent from revascularization recommendations. This review outlines a practical, step-by-step framework for integrating coronary CT angiography into contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention planning, covering acquisition protocols, software platforms, lesion assessment, and stent strategy optimization. It also explores emerging intraprocedural applications, including fusion imaging, augmented and virtual reality, and holographic visualization. By synthesizing current evidence and identifying gaps, this review positions coronary CT angiography as a promising adjunct in precision-based percutaneous coronary intervention.",
