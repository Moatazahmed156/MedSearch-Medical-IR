  "title": "Biomimetic and microenvironment-adaptive nanoplatform potentiates photodynamic therapy of rheumatoid arthritis via H",
  "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) enables the selective eradication of inflamed synovium to reverse joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Nonetheless, the synovial hypoxia and poor photosensitizer biodistribution in the arthritic joints profoundly restrain the clinical application of PDT. Herein, we constructed a multipronged nanosystem (MM@SC-HN) through hierarchical integration of macrophage membrane (MM) coating and hydrogen sulfide (H",
