  "title": "Relationship of lower-limb muscle properties with motor control, walking and balance in stroke survivors.",
  "abstract": "Stroke survivors exhibit muscular characteristics that can influence motor function, mobility, and balance outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the muscle strength (MST) and stiffness of ankle dorsiflexors (ADF) and plantar-flexors (APF) and compare them between stroke survivors and healthy older adults, and to identify the correlation between the muscle properties of ankle muscles and stroke-related outcomes. This cross-sectional study assessed outcomes using outcome tools/measures, including a handheld dynamometer and MyotonPRO for assessing the muscle properties of the tibialis anterior (TA) and medial gastrocnemius (MG), Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of lower extremity (FMA-LE), Berg balance scale (BBS), timed up and go test (TUG), 10 m walk test (10mWT), limit of stability (LOS) test, and Oxford participation and activities questionnaire (OxPAQ). Total of 65 chronic stroke survivors and 31 healthy controls participated. The MST of the ADF demonstrated a significant positive correlation with that of APF. Additionally, the MST of the ADF and APF demonstrated significant positive correlations with motor control and certain aspects of postural stability. Conversely, it exhibited a significant negative correlation with functional mobility and walking capacity. The TA and MG stiffness was significantly negatively correlated with various aspects of postural stability. Significant differences in the ankle MST were observed between healthy individuals and stroke survivors.",
