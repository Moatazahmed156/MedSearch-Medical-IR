  "title": "Factors affecting prehospital delay in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the Republic of Georgia: a country-wide, prospective study.",
  "abstract": "Recently, a nationwide stroke care consisting of stroke care units (SCU) and stroke centers (SC) was established in the Republic of Georgia. A hospital-based prospective registry to evaluate the quality of stroke care and additional nation-wide survey on factors leading to prehospital delay and subsequent low rate of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). 5385 consecutive patients with acute stroke (3636 ischemic, 1302 TIA, 447 hemorrhagic) were included in the stroke registry, of whom 2459 (46%) were female, mean age 70.3+/-11.3years. 1538 (28.6%) patients presented < 6 hours (1160 (21.5%) < 4.5 hours). Of 3636 patients with ischemic stroke, 121 (3.3%) patients received IVT, 72 (2.0%) received EVT and 17 (0.5%) received both. Additional 1067 patients with acute ischemic stroke (898) and TIA (169) were interviewed to understand the factors of prehospital delay. Of these, 472 (44.2%) were female, mean age 70.5±11.4 years, and 339 (31.8%) patients arrived < 6 hours (219 (20.5%) <4.5 hours). Forty-two patients (4.7%) received IVT, 37 (4.1%) received EVT and 6 (0,7%) received both. Pre-ictal education level, high socio-economic status, stroke awareness, calling the ambulance, and a knowledgeable ambulance team transferring patients to the stroke-ready hospital predicted timely arrival at the stroke center. The study reveals major problems in the prehospital management of acute stroke. There is a great need for a nation-wide geographic transfer plan for acute stroke service, connecting ambulances, SCUs and SC and for the educational campaigns to increase stroke awareness among the population.",
