  "title": "Mitophagy in breast cancer: Regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy among women and presents significant challenges, such as drug resistance and relapse, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mitophagy is the primary process by which damaged mitochondria are degraded via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. The regulatory mechanisms of mitophagy and its role in BC progression are crucial for the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of mitophagy in BC, highlighting the gaps in knowledge related to reliable biomarkers and personalized treatment strategies. The pathways and mechanisms of mitophagy and their importance in BC are also summarized. Key findings include the dual role of mitophagy in BC development, the association of mitophagy-related genes/proteins with BC pathogenesis, and the potential of mitophagy modulators in enhancing treatment outcomes. This review further discusses the design of biosensors for detecting mitophagy in BC metastasis and explores the potential of mitophagy-related genes as biomarkers and prognostic factors. The unique value of this manuscript lies in its in-depth exploration of the regulatory mechanisms of mitophagy in BC, providing a scientific basis for clinical management and treatment while offering guidance for future research directions.",
