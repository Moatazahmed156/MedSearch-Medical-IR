    "abstract": "This article aims to provide a multidisciplinary approach to ovarian/adnexal lesions in young patients. Functional cysts, torsions, benign tumors, and malignancies occur within the ovaries of children and adolescents at varying frequencies. Careful conservative management, based on the ultrasonographic sign of presence of normal ovarian tissue, in most circumstances can lead to appropriate ovarian-preserving treatments. The symptomatic ovarian cyst is often due to complications such as hemorrhage and ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion represents surgical emergency, and a high index of clinical suspicion, based on ovarian volume and edema of the tissue, must be maintained to avoid inadvertent delay in therapy.",
