    "abstract": "While biomarkers have greatly impacted the diagnosis and management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the use of biomarkers has been slow to permeate management of atrial fibrillation. Guideline recommendations on the use of biomarkers in atrial fibrillation were virtually nonexistent until the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on atrial fibrillation offered a class IIb recommendation to consider using biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptide to further refine stroke and bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients. Biomarker levels have been associated with incident atrial fibrillation, postoperative atrial fibrillation, acute atrial fibrillation, diagnosis of myocardial infarction and heart failure in atrial fibrillation, and prognosis in atrial fibrillation. This review will offer an in-depth survey of current evidence on the use of biomarkers in atrial fibrillation and propose clinical algorithms to aid the internist in using biomarkers in atrial fibrillation management.",
