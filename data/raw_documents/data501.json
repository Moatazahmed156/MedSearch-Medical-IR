    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal dysphagia is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in older adults. It has been reported in the literature that 11-68% of older adults experience swallowing difficulties. This study aimed to investigate the presence of dysphagia in older adults, whether this dysphagia is related to age (presbyphagia) or sarcopenia by comparing it with adults. Two hundred twenty-five patients were included in this cross-sectional study. The participants were divided into two groups by age as 'adults' and 'older adults'. Sarcopenia, dysphagia and malnutrition evaluations were performed. Older adult and adult groups were compared in terms of malnutrition, dysphagia and sarcopenia. The number of patients with dysphagia was significantly higher (P = 0.007) in the older adults. In older adults, all sarcopenic evaluation parameters were found significantly lower than adults (P < 0.05). The number of older adults with malnutrition was significantly lower in patients with normal swallowing (P < 0.05). The swallowing difficulty can be detected in older adults even if it does not cause any complaint. While most swallowing disorders may be due to age-related changes, about a third may be accompanied by sarcopenia.",
