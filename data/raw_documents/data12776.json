  "abstract": "Tumor-associated stromal (TAS) cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibit marked transcriptional heterogeneity. However, the spatial organization of TAS subpopulations and their clinical relevance in human colorectal cancer (CRC) are incompletely understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex imaging, we identified multiple TAS subpopulations with distinct intratumoral and peritumoral abundance, and found that CRC patients enriched in FAP",
