    "abstract": "Over the past years, many significant advances have been made in the field of gene therapy and shown promising results in clinical trials conducted. Gene therapy aims at modifying or replacing a defective, inefficient, or nonfunctional gene with a healthy, functional gene by administration of genome material into the cell to cure genetic diseases. Various methods have been devised to do this by using several viral and non-viral vectors which are either administered by in vivo or ex vivo technique. Viral vectors are best suitable for this therapy due to their potential to invade cells and deliver their genetic material whereas non-viral vectors are less efficient than viral vectors but possess some advantages such as less immunogenic response and large gene carrying capacity. Recent advances in biotechnology such as CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering and Cancer treatment with Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy are addressed in this review. This review article also delves into some recent research studies, gene therapy trials, and its applications, laying out future hopes for gene therapy in the treatment of various diseases namely haemophilia, Muscular dystrophy, SCID, Sickle cell disease, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Cystic Fibrosis. Additionally, it also includes various nanoformulations and clinical trial data related to gene therapy.",
