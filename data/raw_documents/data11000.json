  "title": "Correlation of C-reactive protein/albumin ratios and electrolytes with APACHE II score and prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
  "abstract": "To investigate the correlations between the serum C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin (Alb) ratio, electrolyte levels, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as their associations with prognosis. Clinical data from 180 COPD patients recruited between March 2023 and August 2024 were analyzed. Patients were divided into RF (n=106) and non-RF groups (n=74). APACHE II scores were assessed within 24 hours of admission. Serum levels of CRP, Alb, Na APACHE II scores were positively correlated with the CRP/Alb ratio (r=0.201, P=0.007) and negatively correlated with serum Ca The CRP/Alb ratio and electrolyte levels hold clinical value as potential biomarkers for evaluating disease severity and prognosis in COPD patients.",
