    "abstract": "Viable yellow obese mice (Avy/a) were treated for 10 days with 5, 15, 50 or 150 micrograms/d of either alpha-MSH or desacetyl-MSH. The half-maximal effect on weight gain occurred with a dose of 5 micrograms/d for desacetyl-MSH and at a 30 fold higher level of 150 micrograms/d for alpha-MSH. In contrast, the half-maximal stimulation of eumelanin production by alpha-MSH occurred at 15 micrograms/d and with desacetyl-MSH at 150 micrograms/d, a 10-fold increase. Desacetyl-MSH produced a dose-related increase in the weight of muscle, as well as white and brown adipose tissue. Desacetyl-MSH and alpha-MSH both increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, but desacetyl-MSH was more potent. In a 2 x 2 factorial designed study, body weight was significantly increased in viable yellow mice only by treatment with desacetyl-MSH but in the lean animals, both alpha-MSH and desacetyl-MSH increased body weight. Food intake was significantly different between genotypes, and was stimulated by desacetyl-MSH. These studies demonstrate potent differences in biological actions on food intake, body weight, and a variety of organ weights between acetylated and desacetylated forms of MSH.",
