  "title": "Association between early-life respiratory syncytial virus infection and the risk of asthma: a meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in early childhood, yet its long-term impact on asthma development remains uncertain. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the association between early-life RSV-LRTI and the subsequent risk of asthma. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted. Observational studies comparing asthma incidence between children with early-life RSV-LRTI (before 3 years of age) and those without early-life LRTI or with non-RSV LRTI were included. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model to incorporate the possible influences of heterogeneity. Eighteen studies with 266,071 children were included. Compared to children without early-life LRTI, those with RSV-LRTI had a significantly higher risk of asthma (RR =1.88; 95% CI: 1.55 to 2.29; P<0.001; I Early-life RSV-LRTI is associated with an increased risk of asthma compared to children without early-life LRTI. However, RSV does not appear to confer a higher risk of asthma than non-RSV LRTI in early life.",
