    "abstract": "Breast cancer occurs in about 1% of men, but the number of men receiving a diagnosis is increasing. Data on male breast cancer (MBC) is limited, and treatment for men is based primarily on treatments used for women. However, some argue that breast cancer in men is a different disease than breast cancer in women. Multiple risk factors, including those with genetic and environmental origins, affect the likelihood of men receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. This article discusses types of MBC, risk factors, treatment options, and ethical concerns men encounter after they receive a breast cancer diagnosis.",
