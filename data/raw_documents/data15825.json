  "title": "Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Complicated by Invasive ",
  "abstract": "There have been no previously reported cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) complicated by invasive pneumococcal infection requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). A 44-year-old man was transferred to our hospital under V-V ECMO for severe respiratory failure. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral crazy-paving patterns, and milky bronchoalveolar lavage fluid confirmed PAP. On day 3, he developed septic shock due to  In this rare case of PAP complicated by invasive pneumococcal infection, timely therapeutic interventions were successfully performed under V-V ECMO support.",
