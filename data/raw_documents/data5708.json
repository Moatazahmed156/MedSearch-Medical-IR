    "abstract": "In neonates, the gastrointestinal tract is rapidly colonized by bacteria after birth. Gut microbiota development is critical during the first few years of life. However, disruption of gut microbiota development in neonates can lead to gut dysbiosis, characterized by overcolonization by pathogenic bacteria and delayed or failed maturation toward increasing microbial diversity and Fermicutes dominance. Gut dysbiosis can predispose infants to sepsis. Pathogenic bacteria can colonize the gut prior to sepsis and cause sepsis through translocation. This review explores gut microbiota development in neonates, the evidence linking gut dysbiosis to neonatal sepsis, and the potential role of probiotics in gut microbiota modulation and sepsis prevention.",
