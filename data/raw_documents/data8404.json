    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is associated with an immune response. Physiological inflammation response causes self-repair and protection, while pathological autoimmune response leads to ventricular remodeling and heart failure. Laying emphasis on regulating the immune function may become a new target for the prevention of heart failure after myocardial infarction. This review focuses on the mechanism of immune-mediated ventricular remodeling and the immune therapy after myocardial infarction.",
