    "abstract": "Stem cells can remain quiescent, self-renewal, and differentiate into many types of cells and even cancer stem cells. The coordination of these complex processes maintains the homeostasis of the organism. Ubiquitination is an important posttranslational modification process that regulates protein stability and activity. The ubiquitination levels of stem cell-associated proteins are closely related with stem cell characteristics. Cullin-RING Ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, accounting for approximately 20% of proteins degraded by proteasome. In this review, we discuss the role of CRLs in stem cell homeostasis, self-renewal, and differentiation and expound their ubiquitination substrates. In addition, we also discuss the effect of CRLs on the formation of cancer stem cells that may provide promising therapy strategies for cancer.",
