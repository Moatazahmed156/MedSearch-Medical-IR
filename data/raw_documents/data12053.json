  "title": "Apoptosis and anti-migratory effects of Methyl gallate combined with Cisplatin in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug because of its strong efficacy in killing various cancer cells. However, it presents several toxicity effects and development of drug resistance. Looking at these shortcomings, there is growing interest in combining conventional chemotherapeutic drugs with natural compounds. Therefore, a natural phenolic compound, methyl gallate, known to have strong anticancer and antioxidant properties, is a potential candidate for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the side effects of current chemotherapy drugs. This study aims to determine the antiproliferative effect of methyl gallate and its combination with cisplatin on MCF-7 cells using MTT assay. The combination effect was evaluated using MTT assay and then analysed using CompuSyn software. Besides, this study was done to evaluate the morphology of apoptotic cells using AO/PI stain and to determine the ability of the combination treatment to inhibit the migration of MCF-7 cells using wound healing assay. The cell viability was inhibited dose-dependently with IC  In conclusion, this study suggested that methyl gallate in combination with cisplatin has a good potential to be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent for breast cancer.",
