    "abstract": "The last three decades have been characterized by an exponential increase in knowledge and advances in the clinical management of atrial fibrillation. The purpose of the study is to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a comprehensive investigation of the epidemiological data associated with various risk factors for atrial fibrillation. The leading research methods are analysis and synthesis, comparison, observation, induction and deduction, and grouping method. Research has shown that old age, male gender, and European descent are important risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation. Other modifiable risk factors include a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and high blood pressure predisposing to atrial fibrillation, and each has been shown to induce structural and electrical atrial remodeling. Both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and vice versa creating feedback that increases mortality. The review is a comprehensive study of the epidemiological data linking nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for atrial fibrillation, and the pathophysiological data supporting the relationship between each risk factor and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. This may be necessary for the practice of the treatment of the cardiac system.",
