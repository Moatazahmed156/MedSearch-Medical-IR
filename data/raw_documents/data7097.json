    "abstract": "Back pain is a common clinical symptom. Degeneration of intervertebral discs is one of the most important factors leading to back pain, namely, discogenic back pain. However, at present, the understanding of lumbar intervertebral discs causing back pain is confined to biomechanical and histological studies. The neuropathological mechanism related to discogenic back pain is still not well understood. Many studies have found that as an intervertebral disc degenerates, the peripheral nerve tissues have corresponding structural reorganization, and a series of nerve cells become involved in progression of discogenic back pain. Therefore, study of neural mechanisms that are involved in progression of discogenic back pain will provide additional assistance for treatment of its symptoms. We review the anatomical structure of intervertebral discs and the related neural mechanisms involved in discogenic back pain. We also discuss the current view of neural mechanisms underlying discogenic back pain.",
