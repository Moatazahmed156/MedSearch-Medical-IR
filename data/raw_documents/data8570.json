    "abstract": "The management of acute and chronic wounds resulting from diverse injuries poses a significant challenge to clinical practices and healthcare providers. Wound healing is a complex biological process driven by a natural physiological response. This process involves four distinct phases, namely hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Despite numerous investigations on wound healing and wound dressing materials, complications still persist, necessitating more efficacious therapies. Wound-healing materials can be categorized into natural and synthetic groups. The current study aims to provide a comprehensive review of highly active natural animal and herbal agents as wound-healing promoters. To this end, we present an overview of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies that led to the discovery of potential therapeutic agents for wound healing. We further elucidated the effects of natural materials on various pharmacological pathways of wound healing. The results of previous investigations suggest that natural agents hold great promise as viable and accessible products for the treatment of diverse wound types.",
