    "abstract": "Thymus is an important primary lymphoid organ for T cell development. After T-lineage commitment, the early thymic progenitors (ETPs) develop into CD4-CD8- (DN), CD4+CD8+ (DP) and further CD4+ SP or CD8+ SP T cells. Under the help of thymic epithelial cells (TEC), dendritic cell (DC), macrophage, and B cells, ETPs undergo proliferation, T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement, β-selection, positive selection, and negative selection, and thus leading to the generation of T cells that are diverse repertoire immunocompetent but not self-reactive. Additionally, some self-reactive thymocytes give rise to Treg under the help of TEC and DC. The regulation of T cell development is complicated. As a post-translational modification, ubiquitination regulates signal transduction in diverse biological processes. Ubiquitination functions in T cell development through regulating key signal pathway or maturation and function of related cells. In this review, the regulation of T cell development by ubiquitination is summarized and discussed.",
