    "abstract": "Vitamin D is a lipid soluble vitamin involved primarily in calcium metabolism. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that lower circulating vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and that vitamin D supplementation is associated with decreased cancer mortality. A vast amount of research exists on the possible molecular mechanisms through which vitamin D affects cancer cell proliferation, cancer progression, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the effects of vitamin D on ovarian cancer cell.",
