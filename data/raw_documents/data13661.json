  "title": "Paeoniflorin derivative ameliorates methotrexate resistance in treating rheumatoid arthritis through targeting GRK2-A",
  "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX), a cornerstone disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, exhibits an efficacy rate of approximately 45%-60% in both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and relevant animal models. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying MTX non-responsiveness and developing effective strategies to ameliorate it are of significant clinical importance for advancing precision medicine in RA treatment. Our study aimed to elucidate the role of membrane GRK2 expression in the immunosuppressive effect of MTX mediated by the A The expression of GRK2 and A The study found a negative correlation between the membrane expression of GRK2 on PBLs and the efficacy of MTX, whereas a positive correlation was observed between the membrane expression of A The excessive expression of membrane GRK2 impairs the membrane distribution of A",
