    "abstract": "Domestic violence among pregnant women is a global health issue. This study systemically reviews the literature to estimate the prevalence of violence against pregnant women in developing countries. Prevalence of violence among pregnant women in developing countries ranges from 4% to 29%. The main risk factors found for abuse during pregnancy were belonging to a low-income group, low education in both partners, and unplanned pregnancy. Low birth as a consequence of violence is observed. The vulnerability of pregnant women to violence, and to their consequences is an alarming public health issue in developing countries and calls for the design and implementation of better preventive strategies.",
