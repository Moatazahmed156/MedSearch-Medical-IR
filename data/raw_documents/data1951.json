    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Low-back pain is a worldwide pain syndrome causing important limitations to daily activity. Common treatment guidelines recommend drugs and exercise.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the efficacy of a standardized NeuroMuscular Taping (NMT) lumbar application in reducing pain and improving function associated with back-school therapy (BST).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Single-blind randomized controlled trial. The experimental group was treated with BTS followed by three applications of NMT over 8 days and the control group who underwent only BST. All patients were evaluated before and at the end of treatment, after 4 and 8 weeks from the end of BST and with a follow-up at distance of three months from the last evaluation, with pain numeric scale, Oswestry disability index and Schober test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Significant pain reduction and functional improvement have been observed in the follow-up evaluations in the experimental group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Association of a standardized NMT application to BTS was seen to significantly improve function and reduce pain with longer time efficacy.",
