    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful, recently recognized regulators of gene expression. miRNAs modulate virtually all aspects of cardiac biology, from cardiac specification and development to cardiomyocyte survival and hypertrophy. Expression profiling of experimental and human heart disease has shown that miRNA expression is altered in heart disease, and miRNA expression signatures may be useful biomarkers for heart disease diagnosis and prognosis. Mechanistic studies have revealed how miRNAs contribute to heart disease pathogenesis. Here we review the expression and function of miRNAs in heart disease.",
