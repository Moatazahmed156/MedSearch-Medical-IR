    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be associated with various types of malignancy. However, SLE occurring with ovarian cancer seems rare, and reliable therapeutic approaches for such cases have yet to be identified. We herein report a case of SLE with ovarian cancer that was successfully treated with corticosteroid, plasmapheresis and chemotherapy. This case may provide new insights into treatment approaches for SLE with ovarian cancer.",
