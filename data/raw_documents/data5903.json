    "abstract": "Intragastric balloon (IGB) has been introduced in the 1980's for weight reduction. It can be classified into nonadjustable IGB, such as the BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (BIB), or newer generation Spatz adjustable balloon system. Late IGB-induced gastric perforation is a rare major complication, presenting as acute abdominal pain weeks to months after its insertion. We herein present a 20-year-old patient, with gastric perforation occurring 10 months after Spatz IGB deployment. The patient underwent a successful endoscopic IGB retrieval and laparoscopic exploration with abdominal lavage. We also review the literature of late IGB-induced gastric perforation.",
