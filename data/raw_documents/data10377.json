  "title": "Impact of High-Fat Diet on Biochemical Changes Following Experimental Myocardial Infarction.",
  "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a sudden necrosis of cardiomyocytes, often caused by atherosclerosis, with obesity being a significant risk factor. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on post-MI myocardial remodelling, focusing on inflammatory signalling, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) dysregulation and oxidative stress. Nine-week-old Wistar Kyoto rats fed a control diet or a HFD for 4 weeks, followed by 20 min of left descending coronary artery occlusion and 7 days of reperfusion. Plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured using a Bioplex kit. NOS activity was assessed via [",
