    "abstract": "Recognizing life-threatening infections is crucial for an emergency physician. In this case report, we describe an atypical presentation of a severe, infiltrating kidney infection, which, if not recognized early, could have led to a detrimental outcome. Emphysematous pyelitis, which is class I of emphysematous pyelonephritis, is a rare entity, and patients may present with a urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. To add to this, underrecognition of gram-positive organisms, in this case Corynebacterium, can delay treatment and worsen outcomes, as described in this case. Through this case, we wish to create awareness of this disease and to reinforce emergency physicians to keep this entity on their differential diagnosis when evaluating an immunocompromised patient.",
