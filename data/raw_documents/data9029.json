    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major food crop and increasing rice yield is the primary objective of rice research. Photosynthesis and nitrogen utilization efficiency directly affect the tiller number of rice, which affects the yield of rice. In this study, a stable yellow leaf and less tillering rice mutant yllt10 (yellow leaf and less tillering 10) was obtained by heavy-ion beam mutagenesis of rice variety 'Ke-fu-geng 7'. Compared with the wild type, yllt10 showed reduced chlorophyll content, decreased photosynthesis rate, and abnormal chloroplast structure. The genetic analysis indicated that the phenotype of yllt10 was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Map-based cloning localized YLLT10 between two molecular markers J4 and J5 on chromosome 10. The sequencing of candidate genes within this interval revealed that YLLT10 was an allelic mutation of CAO1/PGL with a single base deletion in the first exon resulting in the frame shift mutation of CAO1/PGL, and YLLT10 was a new allelic variation of CAO1/PGL. The mutant yllt10 was insensitive to changes in nitrogen concentration when being incubated with different nitrogen concentrations. YLLT10 controls leaf color and tiller number and affects photosynthesis and yield of rice. The study of this gene provides a theoretical basis for molecular breeding of rice.",
