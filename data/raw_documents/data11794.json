  "title": "The Molecular Landscape and Utility of Multiomic Analyses in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Further Subtyping and Exploring Novel Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets.",
  "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the poorest prognosis among all breast cancer subtypes, largely due to the lack of targeted therapies and its resistance to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A deeper understanding of TNBC biology is therefore critical for identifying therapeutic targets. Molecular subtyping of TNBC, first introduced over a decade ago, has significantly advanced our knowledge of the disease's biology. However, tumor heterogeneity remains a major factor contributing to poor clinical outcomes and treatment resistance. The integration of multiomic technologies, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, offers a powerful approach to further dissect tumor heterogeneity and accelerate the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review aims to highlight the potential utility and evolving role of multiomics (-omics) in improving our understanding of TNBC biology-particularly tumor heterogeneity-ultimately facilitating the development of novel therapies and actionable strategies to treat the disease.",
