    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Atrial-selective potassium (K(+)) channel blockers may represent a novel therapeutic target. The best validated atrial-specific ion currents are the acetylcholine-activated inward-rectifier K(+) current IK,ACh and ultrarapidly activating delayed-rectifier K(+) current IKur. Two-pore domain and small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels and Kv1.1 channels may also contribute to the atrial repolarization. We review the molecular and electrophysiologic characteristics of atrial-selective K(+) channels and their potential pathophysiologic role in AF. We summarize currently available K(+) channel blockers focusing on the most important compounds.",
