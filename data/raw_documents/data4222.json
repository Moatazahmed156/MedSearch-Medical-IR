    "abstract": "Working conditions that impair sufficient water intake have been associated with kidney problems such as kidney stones, urinary symptoms and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Higher prevalence of these morbidities was linked to occupations that do not facilitate worker access to drinking water and toilets, as well as people who perform activities in a hot environment. In this mini-review, we aim to describe and interpret available evidence in the areas of occupation, hydration and kidney health. This review explores examples of documented kidney health problems affecting professions ranging from astronauts and teachers in developed countries to rural workers in low-income settings living in water-restricted or hot environments.",
