    "abstract": "From a clinical perspective, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a valuable target for both diagnosis and radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer. The term 'specific' has been used to characterize a histologic hallmark of overexpression in the membrane of most prostate cancer. Many PSMA ligands have been developed since the previous decade and have been used in several clinical trials and clinical studies. However, procedure, specification, protocol, interpretation criteria, radiation dose, and cost-effectiveness of PSMA ligands have not been fully explained. Regardless of worldwide use of promising PSMA-ligand PET and RLT, it has not been approved in Japan. Expedited introduction of PSMA-ligand PET and RLT to Japan and implementation of clinical study are eager for many patients with prostate cancer.",
