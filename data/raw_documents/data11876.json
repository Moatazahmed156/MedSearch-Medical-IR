  "title": "Risk of central nervous system metastasis and survival in HER2+ positive breast and non-breast cancers.",
  "abstract": "Incidence, survival, and optimal choice of therapy for central nervous system (CNS) metastasis are well characterized in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC), yet remain poorly defined in other HER2+ solid tumors (STs). A retrospective cohort analysis was performed to characterize the incidence of CNS metastasis and clinical outcomes in patients with HER2+ breast cancer and ST treated at the University of Virginia Emily Couric Cancer Center between January 2010 and January 2022. In the cohort, 50 patients had HER2+ ST and 383 had HER2+ BC. Of the ST group, 48.0% received CNS imaging at diagnosis as compared to 2.9% of breast cancer patients ( Patients with non-breast cancer HER2+ STs had higher risk of CNS metastasis and poorer OS compared to HER2+ breast cancer patients, with lower utilization of HER2-directed therapy.",
