  "title": "Ginsenoside Rd Improves Anticancer Drug-induced Disturbance in Murine Airway Ciliary Motility.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer patients often suffer from chemotherapy-associated complications such as pneumonia and respiratory infections, which are caused by damage to normal cells and airway epithelial tissue. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) involves adsorption of foreign substances by mucus secreted by goblet cells, followed by propulsion into the airway by ciliated cells. MCC is a crucial mechanism that protects against infection. Previously, we demonstrated that ginsenoside Rd (Rd) activates MCC by increasing ciliary beat frequency (CBF). The aims of this study were to assess whether anticancer drugs decrease the CBF of murine airway ciliated cells, and to examine the effects of Rd on CBF suppression. The CBF of primary epithelial cells isolated from B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (B6.CD45.1) mice were measured in the presence of various anticancer drugs, either alone or in combination with Rd. Intracellular cAMP concentrations ([cAMP] Doxorubicin, cisplatin, pemetrexed, paclitaxel, and docetaxel decreased the CBF of murine airway ciliated cells; however, this effect was ameliorated by Rd. In addition, paclitaxel and docetaxel decreased [Ca Anticancer drugs suppress CBF, suggesting that treatment may cause airway infections. Anticancer drug-induced suppression of CBF was ameliorated by Rd, indicating that Rd may reduce the risk of pneumonia and respiratory infections in patients with lung cancer.",
