    "abstract": "Primary Dural lymphoma (PDL) is a rare pathology that occurs in immunocompetent patients. In such cases, these lesions may mimic more common intracranial tumors. We present the case of a patient who presented an intra cranial hypertension syndrome; the brain MRI showed a tissular mass that we took for a meningioma; upon surgical intervention, an occult mass was discovered. Major excision and immunohistochemistry demonstrated PDL. Our case report highlights the rarity of these pathology and the importance of combined surgery and medical treatment, as the latter can be treated with chemoradiation with good clinical outcomes.",
