  "title": "Molecular Diagnosis of Mumps - Mitigation of Resurgence, A South Indian Report.",
  "abstract": "Mumps infection, a public health problem caused by the mumps virus, presents with uni/bilateral swelling of the parotid gland(s) with meningitis and orchitis as complications. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted successful mumps vaccination programs. A prospective study was conducted from January to March 2024 to diagnose suspected mumps patients attending hospitals in southern India. Samples analyzed for mumps using fast-track diagnostics reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kits were categorized as per WHO clinical case definition. Of 200 samples screened, 26 (13%) were positive - 10 blood, 11 cerebrospinal fluid, and 5 Buccal swab samples. In developing countries like India, laboratories with advanced testing methodologies reduce mumps-related morbidity.",
