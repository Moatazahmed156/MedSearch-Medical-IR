    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. However, around the world, the incidence and mortality rates from lung cancer in men have been decreasing, whereas they have been rising in women. Additionally, there are clinical, pathologic, and survival differences between men and women who have lung cancer. Despite these well-documented differences, women remain significantly underrepresented in both surgical and non-surgical prospective clinical trials.",
