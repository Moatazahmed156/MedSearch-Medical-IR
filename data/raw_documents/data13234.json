  "title": "Transcranial stimulation combined with four rehabilitation therapies for gait and motor function in Parkinson's disease: a network meta-analysis of 23 RCTs.",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has become the fastest-growing neurological disease worldwide. This network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of transcranial stimulation combined with four rehabilitation approaches for improving gait and motor function in Parkinson's disease. We systematically searched seven databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang. Data from 23 randomized controlled trials ( (1) For gait outcomes, Dual-Task Training showed optimal efficacy for improving stride length (SUCRA = 100%) and velocity (86.5%), while Exercise Rehabilitation best improved cadence (100%). (2) For motor function, Conventional Rehabilitation demonstrated superior improvement in the Timed Up and Go test (100%), and Dual-Task Training showed advantages in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores (85.1%). All combined interventions significantly outperformed the control groups ( The results support the use of personalized rehabilitation strategies: Dual-Task Training for patients with stride deficits and prominent motor symptoms, Exercise Rehabilitation for cadence improvement, and Conventional Rehabilitation for enhancing general mobility. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for optimizing neurorehabilitation protocols in the management of Parkinson's disease.",
