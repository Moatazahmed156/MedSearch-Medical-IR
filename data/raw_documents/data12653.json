  "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) complicates patient prognosis and treatment. While metabolic reprogramming is a key driver of tumor progression, the role of histidine metabolism in the COAD immune microenvironment remains unclear. Through an integrated analysis of public single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data, we mapped the COAD cellular atlas and assessed histidine metabolism activity. A prognostic Histidine Metabolism-related Model (HRM) was constructed using an ensemble of 101 machine learning algorithms, and its biological underpinnings were explored. The function of the key gene, TRIP6, was validated via  Single-cell analysis identified epithelial cells as the hub of histidine metabolism, which remodels TME intercellular communication. The machine learning-derived HRM robustly stratified patient prognosis across a primary and two validation cohorts. High HRM scores correlated with an \"infiltrated-exhausted\" immune phenotype, characterized by high immune infiltration alongside elevated checkpoint expression. The key signature gene TRIP6 was identified as a driver of poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive state, and its silencing suppressed malignant phenotypes  Histidine metabolism is a critical regulator of the COAD immune microenvironment. Our prognostic model, the HRM, provides a clinically relevant tool for risk stratification, while its key mediator, TRIP6, represents a novel therapeutic target linking tumor metabolism to immune evasion.",
