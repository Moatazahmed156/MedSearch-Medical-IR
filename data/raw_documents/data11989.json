  "title": "Understanding the role of vitamin D in osteosarcoma: A narrative review.",
  "abstract": "This review provides a summary of recent evidence on vitamin D and osteosarcoma, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D in osteosarcoma and explore its potential role in patient management. Osteosarcoma, a malignant bone neoplasm, is characterized by its aggressive nature, poor prognosis, and metastatic potential, often spreading to the lungs. Its clinical severity highlights the need for early detection, prompt intervention, and comprehensive treatment strategies to improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by it. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is quantified as a measure of vitamin D status. Vitamin D status is utilized as a clinical biomarker to identify vitamin D deficiency. The role of vitamin D in bone health and development is well known, specifically its regulation of calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Furthermore, recent findings identified vitamin D's role in carcinogenesis by regulating cancer cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and metastatic potential. The involvement of vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) and its polymorphisms in regulating vitamin D bioavailability has also been recognized. However, these findings are primarily in major cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Evidence pertaining to the fundamental role of bone cancer, in particular osteosarcoma, and vitamin D remains scarce. Nevertheless, the limited evidence showed that maintaining circulating 25(OH)D in osteosarcoma patients is associated with a higher survival rate. Meanwhile, vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant could potentially increase survival rates and quality of life.",
