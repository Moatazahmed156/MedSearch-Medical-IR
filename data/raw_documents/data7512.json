    "abstract": "Mammography and other imaging modalities help diagnose initial breast cancers in nearly 200 000 women per year in the United States. Advances in these methods and in breast cancer treatment mean that more people with a personal history of breast cancer are living longer, and these survivors face ongoing risk of breast cancer recurrence, distant metastasis, and death. Survivors also need regular follow-up and surveillance or diagnostic imaging to detect these recurrences early. This article focuses on breast cancer survivors, their follow-up, and surveillance imaging.",
