    "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The main objective was to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives in decreasing the rate of avoidable 30-day, skilled nursing facility (SNF)-to-hospital readmissions.\n    \n\n\n          Problem:\n        \n      \n      The rate of rehospitalizations from SNF within 30 days of original discharge has increased within the last decade.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      The research team participants conducted a literature review via Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and PubMed to collect data about quality improvement implemented in SNFs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The most common facilitator was the incorporation of specialized staff. The most cited barriers were quality improvement tracking and implementation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These strategy examples can be useful to acute care hospitals attempting to lower bounce back from subacute care providers and long-term care facilities seeking quality improvement initiatives to reduce hospital readmissions.",
