    "abstract": "Since their initial recognition, miRNAs have been the subject of rising scientific interest. Especially in recent years, miRNAs have been recognized to play an important role in the mediation of various diseases, and further, their potential as biomarkers was recognized. Rising attention has also been given to miRNA-21, which has proven to play an ambivalent role as a biomarker. Responding to the demand for biomarkers in the trauma field, the present review summarizes the contrary roles of miRNA-21 in acute organ damage after trauma with a specific focus on the role of miRNA-21 in traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cardiac damage, lung injury, and bone injury. This review is based on a PubMed literature search including the terms \"miRNA-21\" and \"trauma\", \"miRNA-21\" and \"severe injury\", and \"miRNA-21\" and \"acute lung respiratory distress syndrome\". The present summary makes it clear that miRNA-21 has both beneficial and detrimental effects in various acute organ injuries, which precludes its utility as a biomarker but makes it intriguing for mechanistic investigations in the trauma field.",
