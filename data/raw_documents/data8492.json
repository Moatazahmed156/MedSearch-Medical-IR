    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine what side effects were most associated with medication nonadherence as reported by adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: A combination of multiple linear regression and chi-square automatic interaction detection techniques were utilized in analyzing the survey data responses of 157 adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Results: The mean number of side effects reported was M = 10.33 side effects with 77% of the sample reporting at least one side effect. In aggregate, the number or severity of side effects were not significantly associated with medication nonadherence. Rather, it was the severity of particular side effects, upset stomach and vomiting, which were significantly associated with medication nonadherence. Conclusions: Health care providers should utilize this information as an indicator that medication nonadherence will be an issue when these side effects are present.",
