    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Wounds, resulting from traumas, surgery, burns or diabetes, are important medical problems due to the complexity of wound healing process regarding healing times and healthcare costs. Nanosystems have emerged as promising candidates in this field thank to their properties and versatile applications in drugs delivery.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      Lipid-based nanosystems (LBN) are described for wound treatment, highlighting their different behaviors when interacting with the cutaneous tissue. The role of nanosystems in delivering mostly natural compounds on skin as well as the technological and engineering strategies to increase their efficiency in wound healing effect are reviewed. Finally, in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo studies are reported.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      LBN have shown promise in addressing the challenges of wound healing as they can improve the stability of drugs used in wound therapy, leading to higher efficacy and fewer adverse effects as compared to traditional formulations. LBNs being involved in the inflammatory and proliferation stages of the wound healing process, enable the modification of wound healing through multiple ways. In addition, the use of new technologies, including 3D bioprinting and photobiomodulation, may lead to potential breakthroughs in wound healing. This would provide clinicians with more potent forms of therapy for wound healing.",
