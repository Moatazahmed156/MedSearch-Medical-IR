    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Bupropion is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which is prescribed as an effective drug for the treatment of depression and as a complementary drug for smoking cessation in more than 50 countries. Although constipation and nausea are known as side effects of Bupropion, gastric ulcer has not been previously reported.\n    \n\n\n          Case presentation:\n        \n      \n      In this case report a 28-year-old woman presented with a gastric ulcer 8 months after beginning depression treatment with Bupropion 150 mg once daily. Pantoprazole and Famotidine were prescribed to the patient. However, the gastric ulcer did not heal. After discontinuation of Bupropion, the gastric ulcer was treated.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The present case report suggests that Bupropion may lead to peptic ulcers or this drug interferes with the treatment of gastric ulcers.",
