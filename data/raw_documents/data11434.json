  "title": "Evaluating Stroke-Related Motor Impairment and Recovery Using Macroscopic and Microscopic Features of HD-sEMG.",
  "abstract": "Stroke-induced motor impairment necessitates objective and quantitative assessment tools for rehabilitation planning. In this study, a gesture-specific framework based on high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) was developed to characterize neuromuscular dysfunction using eight macroscopic features and two microscopic motor unit decomposition features. HD-sEMG recordings were collected from stroke patients (",
