  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is now the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world, driven by obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), can culminate in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While lifestyle modification remains central to MASLD management, there is growing interest in pharmacological interventions, particularly nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies (NuSHs), such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. NuSHs exert metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily via weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. Emerging clinical data support their efficacy in resolving MASH without worsening fibrosis. However, benefits in cirrhotic patients are less evident, suggesting greater utility in early intervention. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest a reduction in liver-related morbidity with GLP-1 receptor agonist use, though fibrosis regression remains inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that NuSHs may also reduce MASH-related HCC incidence and tumor burden, likely through systemic metabolic improvements rather than direct antineoplastic action. Observational human data following bariatric surgery reinforce this link, suggesting that weight loss itself plays a key preventive role. Herein, we propose that NuSHs are promising candidates for MASH-related HCC prevention. We provide mechanistic suggestions for how this may occur. Furthermore, incorporating NuSHs into the post-locoregional treatment pathway for HCC may delay the need for systemic anti-cancer therapies, improve immunotherapy synergy and transplant eligibility, and even slow disease progression through reversal of carcinogenic drivers. Future studies are needed to target oncological endpoints and clarify immunometabolic mechanisms to guide the integration of NuSHs into MASLD treatment algorithms.",
