  "title": "HER2-Low and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer and Trastuzumab Deruxtecan: Common Clinical Questions and Answers.",
  "abstract": "Approximately 80% of invasive breast cancers are classified as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative; however, many of these tumors have detectable levels of HER2 surface expression. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate with a membrane-permeable payload that is cytotoxic to both HER2-expressing tumor cells and neighboring cells via the bystander antitumor effect. T-DXd has shown significant antitumor activity in clinical trials for patients with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]+) breast cancer. In addition, the results of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial demonstrated the clinical benefit of T-DXd in patients with HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer after receiving prior chemotherapy. DESTINY-Breast06 demonstrated the clinical benefit of T-DXd in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), and HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy in the advanced setting. These results validate the need for a standard-of-care diagnostic test to identify HER2-low and HER2-ultralow expression levels in patients with metastatic breast cancer to guide therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, effective treatment sequencing strategies and adverse event management are essential for maximizing patient benefit. This review presents the identification of HER2-low and HER2-ultralow breast cancer, sequencing of T-DXd with other treatments, and management of common or clinically significant adverse events reported with T-DXd.",
