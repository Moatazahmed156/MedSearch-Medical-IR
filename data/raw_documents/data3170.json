    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis, a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease, is localized to the colonic mucosa but can affect other organs and lead to various complications. Gastroduodenitis associated with ulcerative colitis has been reported. However, little is known about esophageal ulcers. We herein report two rare cases of esophageal ulcers associated with ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, the clinical and histological characteristics of 18 previously reported cases are summarized. This case series and literature review will encourage the accurate diagnosis and treatment of esophageal ulcers associated with ulcerative colitis.",
