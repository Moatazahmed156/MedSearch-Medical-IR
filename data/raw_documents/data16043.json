  "title": "A New Breath: Dynamics of Respiratory Infections After the Lifting of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Related to COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "The epidemiology of respiratory viruses shifted considerably following the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent rollback of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The initial global containment strategies implemented during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak profoundly altered viral transmission dynamics and circulation patterns. As the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 no longer a public health emergency in May 2023, viral circulation began reverting to pre-pandemic trends. This retrospective observational study examined the evolving epidemiological patterns of respiratory infections during and after the lifting of NPI, assessing associated clinical manifestations and their relationship with patient-specific risk factors. Data were collected from 307 patients tested between October 2021 and December 2024 using a respiratory multiplex PCR at the Rodolphe Mérieux Laboratory in Lebanon. Results revealed a reemergence of pre-pandemic seasonal trends for most viruses. Rhinovirus remained the most prevalent pathogen, likely due to the absence of a vaccine. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Influenza A resumed their characteristic winter peaks, while human metapneumovirus (HMPV) showed no co-infections, suggesting viral interference. The persistence of Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 appeared influenced by vaccine coverage, viral mutations, and environmental factors. Multiplex PCR testing proved to be a valuable yet costly tool for both diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. Overall, this study highlights the importance of continued viral monitoring in the post-NPI period, reflecting both the effectiveness of NPIs in limiting viral spread and the importance of ensuring wider access to advanced diagnostic methods.",
