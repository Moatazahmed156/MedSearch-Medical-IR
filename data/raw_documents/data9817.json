  "title": "Depression increases the risk of contracting genital herpes and genital wart in U.S. adults: A cross-sectional analysis.",
  "abstract": "Depression is associated with a higher prevalence of self-reported risky sexual behaviors, potentially increasing susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, epidemiological evidence linking depression to genital herpes or genital warts remains limited. This cross-sectional analysis utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9. STIs were self-reported via audio computer-assisted self-interview in private rooms at the Mobile Examination Center. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to evaluate associations between depression and genital herpes/warts-related outcomes, supplemented by subgroup analyses to identify vulnerable populations. Adults with depression demonstrated significantly elevated risks of genital herpes (odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval:1.22-2.45) and genital warts (odds ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval:1.36-2.35) compared with nondepressed individuals. Subgroup analyses revealed differential vulnerability across demographic and clinical strata, with females, individuals with postsecondary education, and hypertensive patients exhibiting heightened susceptibility to both infections. Depression was associated with higher odds of genital herpes and genital warts among US adults. These findings underscore the clinical importance of integrating STIs screening into mental health management protocols, particularly among females and individuals with higher educational attainment. Enhanced preventive strategies targeting high-risk sexual behaviors in depressed populations are warranted.",
