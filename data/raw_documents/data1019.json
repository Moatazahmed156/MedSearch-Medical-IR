    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Paricalcitol has been proposed for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure and vitamin D deficiency (VDD); however, VDD is related to a range of clinical complaints. We aimed to investigate the effects of paricalcitol on body composition in VDD rats.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty adult male rats aged 10 weeks were randomly divided into three groups of 10, comprising control, VDD, and VDD plus paricalcitol (32 ng/rat intraperitoneal injection) (VDD+P), at the Animal Lab of the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Shiraz, Iran, in 2020. Body composition was assessed after three weeks via serum biochemical tests and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Finally, the data were analyzed by using the paired-sample t test, the one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey post hoc test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Global lean mass and fat mass were lower in the VDD and VDD+P groups than in the controls (P<0.001). Global fat percentage was reduced significantly in the VDD+P group (P=0.029).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Paricalcitol reduced global fat mass and fat percentage in a rat model with VDD. Evaluation of insulin and adiponectin levels is suggested to clarify the physiology of paricalcitol in VDD states.",
