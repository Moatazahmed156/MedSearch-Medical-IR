    "abstract": "The fact that a significant proportion of diabetics die of heart disease has led to the belief that the excess mortality is due to coronary athersclerosis, yet many risk factors for the latter are common to diabetics and non-diabetics. In fact, heart disease in diabetes is not synonymous with coronary heart disease.
