  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a globally prevalent autoimmune musculoskeletal disease that requires early-stage treatment. Initially, patients with RA exhibit elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and acidic conditions within the articular spaces. These two factors synergistically promote lipid peroxidation in M2 macrophages and lead to increased inflammation. Our work was then designed to engineer a multifunctional nanomedicine that targets the increased lipid peroxidation sensitivity of M2 macrophages. We successfully synthesized a calcium carbonate (CaCO",
