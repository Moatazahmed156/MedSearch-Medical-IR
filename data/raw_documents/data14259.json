  "abstract": "The coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification helps understand knee alignment variability, guiding personalised total knee arthroplasty (TKA) strategies. However, evidence regarding the impact of postoperative CPAK classification changes on patient-reported functional outcomes after restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) TKA remains limited. This study aimed to investigate whether CPAK classification changes after TKA with rKA influence functional outcomes, measured by the International Knee Society score (IKS). A retrospective cohort study included 464 patients who underwent primary TKA with a posterior stabilised implant (KNEO A significant redistribution of CPAK classifications was observed postoperatively ( Changes in CPAK classification following rKA-TKA were common but did not significantly influence functional outcomes at 2 years. These findings suggest that CPAK phenotype transition alone may not be a reliable predictor of clinical success, although larger studies are needed to explore subtype-specific effects. Level IV.",
