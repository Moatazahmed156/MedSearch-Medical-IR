  "title": "Novel 1-benzyl-2-indolinone indole hybrids as tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Design, synthesis, and biological activity evaluation.",
  "abstract": "In the present study, new 1-benzyl-2-indolinone indole hybrids (4a-s) were synthesized and their cytotoxic effects were determined against human breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231), lung (A549), kidney (CAKI-1 and A498), colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and pancreas (MIA PaCa-2) cancer cells by MTT assay. Some of the tested compounds showed significantly better inhibitory effects and safety profiles than sunitinib malate against A498 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Compound 4s showed a selective and significant cytotoxic effect on MIA PaCa-2 cells (IC",
