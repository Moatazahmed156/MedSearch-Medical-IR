    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Brucellosis is highly endemic in Turkey and doxycycline is commonly used for its treatment. The present study aimed at documenting the cutaneous side effects of doxycycline in pediatric brucellosis patients in Turkey.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric patients with brucellosis that were treated between February 2014 and January 2016 were analyzed retrospectively, and those that developed doxycycline-related cutaneous side effects were identified. Demographic data, epidemiological history, physical examination findings, laboratory test results, anti-brucellosis treatment regimen, duration of follow up and outcome were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 189 brucellosis patients, 141 treated with doxycycline plus rifampicin. Seven patients (5%) (two female and five male) developed doxycycline-related cutaneous side effects. Mean duration of treatment before the onset of cutaneous side effects was 9.5 weeks. Doxycycline therapy was continued in five of these patients and was changed in two patients. In the patients that continued to receive doxycycline the cutaneous side effects gradually improved.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cutaneous side effects of doxycycline should always be a consideration, especially in regions in which brucellosis is endemic and doxycycline is commonly used to treat it.",
