    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus currently ranks high among indicators used in Global Burden of Disease Studies. The current study estimated the burden of disease attributable to type 2 diabetes mellitus and its chronic complications in Brazil, 2008. We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) stratified by gender, age bracket, and major geographic region. Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounted for 5% of the burden of disease in Brazil, ranking 3rd in women and 6th in men in the composition of DALYs. The largest share of DALYs was concentrated in the 30-59-year age bracket and consisted mainly of YLDs. The highest YLL and YLD rates were in the Northeast and South of Brazil, respectively. Chronic complications represented 80% of YLDs from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus ranked as a leading health problem in Brazil in 2008, accounting for relevant shares of mortality and morbidity.",
