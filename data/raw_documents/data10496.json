Indexed libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer (300 base pairs paired-end reads). The most common loss-of-function mutations occurred in genes encoding the MexAB-OprM efflux-pump system, the pvd cluster and the fpvA receptor, and genes involved in twitching motility such as  Our data indicates that ",
