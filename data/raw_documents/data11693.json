  "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor among women worldwide, and the limited selectivity as well as the emerging resistance to currently used therapies highlight the need to search for new therapeutic compounds. Aromatase, a key enzyme in the estrogen biosynthesis pathway, represents a recognized molecular target in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers. In this study, six new 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives containing two halogen-substituted aromatic rings were designed and synthesized as potential nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. The cytotoxic activity of the obtained compounds was evaluated against two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 (estrogen-dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen-independent). All tested compounds exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells, with the strongest effects observed for compounds ",
