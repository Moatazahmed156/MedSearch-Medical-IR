    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in regulating the progression of ovarian cancer. Macrophages, which are important immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, participate in the regulation of various biological behaviors and influence the prognosis of ovarian cancer. A large number of studies have targeted macrophages for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In addition, macrophages also play a regulatory role by interacting with other immune cells, including T cells and mesothelial cells, in the ovarian cancer microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the progress made in macrophage-targeted therapy for ovarian cancer. Although there are still several challenges in using this treatment, targeted macrophage therapy is still a promising treatment for ovarian cancer.",
