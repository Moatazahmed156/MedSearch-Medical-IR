  "abstract": "Introduction Patients with diabetes frequently develop diabetic foot ulcers, a significant clinical pathology that results in increased morbidity and mortality. Standard of care (SOC) treatment has been insufficient to prevent the poor outcomes associated with these wounds. This analysis aims to evaluate the supplementation of SOC with a human tissue allograft. Methods This evaluation is of two prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical studies (ELITE - ongoing and CAMPLIFE - terminated) comparing a dehydrated human amnion-intermediate layer-chorion membrane (dHAICM) tissue allograft (AmchoPlast",
