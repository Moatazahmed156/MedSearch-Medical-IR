    "abstract": "Adrenal myelolipomas are rare, benign, nonfunctional tumors composed of mature adipose tissue and hematopoietic elements. Hemorrhage within an adrenal myelolipoma is an uncommon occurrence, and when it happens, it can present with various clinical manifestations. Here, we report a case of a hemorrhagic giant adrenal myelolipoma in a 45-year-old female that was discovered incidentally. We discuss the clinical presentation, radiological findings, surgical intervention, and postoperative outcomes in this case report.",
