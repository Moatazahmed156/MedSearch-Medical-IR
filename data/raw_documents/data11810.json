  "title": "A Novel Trained Immunity Adjuvant Derived From Commensal Bacteria Potentiates Liposome-Hydrogel Cancer Vaccine Against Breast Tumors.",
  "abstract": "Traditionally, vaccines rely on adaptive immunity to confer protection, yet emerging evidence highlights the importance of trained immunity in enhancing innate immune responses for broad-spectrum defense. The M28 family peptidase (M28), secreted by the commensal bacterium Peribacillus frigoritolerans, acts as a novel inducer of trained immunity with adjuvant potential. In studies using ovalbumin (OVA) as model antigen, both free M28 and M28-loaded liposome (M28-Lipo) significantly enhanced antigen-specific IgG production, stimulated splenic CD4",
