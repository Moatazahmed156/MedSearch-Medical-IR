  "title": "COVID-19 impacts and post-pandemic rebound in Pakistan's sectoral greenhouse gas emissions (2018-2023).",
  "abstract": "This study presents the first multi-year, sectorally disaggregated greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory for Pakistan covering 2018-2023, capturing pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic dynamics. Using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and national activity data by sector, emissions were quantified across energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), and waste sectors. Total GHG emissions declined by 7% during 2019-2020, with energy sector emissions falling 16% from 217 Mt CO",
