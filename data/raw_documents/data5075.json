    "abstract": "Recent outstanding clinical results produced by engineered T cells, including chimeric antigen receptors, have already facilitated further research that broadens their applicability. One such direction is to explore new T cell sources for allogeneic \"off-the-shelf\" adoptive immunotherapy. Human pluripotent stem cells could serve as an alternative cell source for this purpose due to their unique features of infinite propagation ability and pluripotency. Here, we describe the current state of engineered T cell transfer with the focus on cell manufacturing processes and the potentials and challenges of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived T cells as a starting material to construct off-the-shelf T-cell banks.",
