  "title": "Ketogenic Diet Reduces Alcohol Consumption and Improves Memory and Sociability in Mice.",
  "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is highly prevalent with known associations to poor health and memory. Diet interventions are a useful tool that have the potential to help many, as they are relatively non-invasive and accessible. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that has been used for decades to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy. In the current study, the effects of 3 weeks of KD on alcohol use and anxiety, and post-alcohol anxiety, sociability and memory were assessed in C57BL/6J mice. In Experiment 1 and 1a, mice were allowed to drink alcohol for 8 weeks using the intermittent drinking in the dark paradigm. Across the last 3 weeks of drinking, mice were fed either KD or a standard chow diet and tested for performance in a Barnes maze. In Experiment 2, mice were fed either KD or standard diet for 3 weeks and observed for anxiety and social behaviors, and memory. Experiment 2a extended this work using a small number of male mice that were injected with alcohol for 1 week prior to behavioral assessment. Overall, our findings suggest a therapeutic effect of KD on alcohol consumption and post-alcohol deficits. Benefits were independent of effects on generalized anxiety yet support a more specific effect of KD to increase exploration and reduce behavioral inhibition. This study did not investigate the neurobiology mediating these effects and future research for this is now needed.",
