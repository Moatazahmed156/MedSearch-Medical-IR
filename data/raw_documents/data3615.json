    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is one of the most intriguing genetic conditions now being studied. As the most common inherited form of mental retardation, it has an incidence of approximately 1 in 1000 male infants and boys. Because the cytogenetic diagnosis has only recently been available, many affected boys and female carriers have not yet been identified. This article reviews the characteristic, clinical features of fragile X syndrome and discusses treatment and intervention.",
