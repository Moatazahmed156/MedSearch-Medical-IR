Patients may seek treatment of anatomic areas including the face, chest, breast, and genitalia. The aim of this scoping review is to provide a general understanding of wound healing to optimize outcomes and manage complications.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A scoping review was performed to include wound healing principles, outcomes related to gender-affirming surgery, and management of postsurgical wounds.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Based on the review performed and clinical experience, strategies to manage complications are recommended. These include an understanding of wound healing principles, patient optimization, and postoperative management.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      A comprehensive understanding of wound healing principles, perioperative optimization, and postoperative management of wounds assists the provider in mitigating and managing complications.",
