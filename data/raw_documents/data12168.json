  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related death, highlighting the need for new molecular targets and novel therapeutics. Matrix metalloproteinases are key regulators of invasion and microenvironment remodeling, and among them, matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) is a particularly attractive candidate whose network-level effects in cancer are still poorly defined. Herein, we applied an integrative strategy that combines bioinformatics methods with experimental validation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and pathway analyses of MMP12-regulated genes identified 113 downstream targets enriched in the extracellular matrix, PI3K-AKT, and immune pathways, from which an eight-gene panel (MMP12, CD44, ADAM9, NFKBIA, PSME3, SPARCL1, CCL15, and APOA1) was prioritized as a biomarker signature. Guided by these predictions, we screened a 31-compound MMP12 inhibitor library and selected five leads (",
