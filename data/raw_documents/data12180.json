  "title": "A Real-World Experience on the Efficacy of First-Line Treatment with Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients with PD-L1 Expression ≥50%: The Role of ",
  "abstract": "Several genetic alterations have been identified as drivers of uncontrolled cell growth in lung cancer, with KRAS mutations representing the most prevalent driver oncogene. Despite advances in targeted treatment, the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC is still less than 20%. This study aims to assess the clinical relevance of KRAS mutations in the context of PD-L1 expression, focusing on patients with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50% and treated with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a retrospective analysis of a real-world cohort comprising all staged NSCLC patients diagnosed and treated between 2018 and 2022 at our Institution with the available Next Generation Sequencing and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results. Statistical analyses were made using the log-rank test, the two-tailed Fisher's exact test, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Among 520 NSCLC patients, 288 were adenocarcinoma (AC). Of these, 110/288 (38.2%) were KRAS mutants, and 83/278 (29.8%) presented a PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%. In this subgroup, KRAS mutants demonstrated longer median overall survival (mOS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the KRAS wild-type (28.7 vs. 10.7 months,  This study is the first to investigate the interplay between KRAS mutations and PD-L1 expression in a real-world stage IV lung AC cohort treated with ICIs. Our findings indicate that the p.G12D mutation is associated with an extremely severe disease upon ICI monotherapy. These preliminary results need further validation in larger, prospective cohorts.",
