    "abstract": "In the past decade, a new frontier in scarless wound healing has arisen because of significant advances in the field of wound healing realised by incorporating emerging concepts from mechanobiology and immunology. The complete integumentary organ system (IOS) regeneration and scarless wound healing mechanism, which occurs in specific species, body sites and developmental stages, clearly shows that mechanical stress signals and immune responses play important roles in determining the wound healing mode. Advances in tissue engineering technology have led to the production of novel human skin equivalents and organoids that reproduce cell-cell interactions with tissue-scale tensional homeostasis, and enable us to evaluate skin tissue morphology, functionality, drug response and wound healing. This breakthrough in tissue engineering has the potential to accelerate the understanding of wound healing control mechanisms through complex mechanobiological and immunological interactions. In this review, we present an overview of recent studies of biomechanical and immunological wound healing and tissue remodelling mechanisms through comparisons of species- and developmental stage-dependent wound healing mechanisms. We also discuss the possibility of elucidating the control mechanism of wound healing involving mechanobiological and immunological interaction by using next-generation human skin equivalents.",
