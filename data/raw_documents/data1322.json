    "abstract": "Pregnancy seems to be a risk factor for severe disease with COVID-19. Although SARS-CoV-2 intrauterine transmission seems to be rare, most studies show COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk for pregnancy complications, with higher risk among those with severe disease compared with those mildly affected. Studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and effective. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been found in umbilical cord blood and breast milk following maternal vaccination, which might provide protection to the infant. However, vaccination rates during pregnancy remain low. Studies are needed to understand ways to address SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant persons.",
