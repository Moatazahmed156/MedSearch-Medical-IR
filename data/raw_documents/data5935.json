    "abstract": "Tests to measure the volume of gastric contents are necessary to determine the nature of a gastric emptying disorder. The conditions that can affect gastric emptying are as varied as peptic ulcer disease, achlorhydria, viral and bacterial infections of the stomach, diabetes, scleroderma, anorexia nervosa, and CNS lesions; some patients experience gastric emptying problems after surgery for peptic ulcer disease. The future of electrical pacing of the stomach and perhaps the gastrointestinal tract in general is very exciting, as is the future use of antiarrhythmic drugs.",
