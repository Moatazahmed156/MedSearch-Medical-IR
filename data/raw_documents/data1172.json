    "abstract": "Heart failure coexists with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which seriously affects the clinical treatment and prognosis. At present, the treatment for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually combined with two treatment strategies for heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, increasing studies showed that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has a positive effect on the treatment of patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we summarize the latest and current understanding of the management for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus and further present contemporary treatment options, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, for these particular populations.",
