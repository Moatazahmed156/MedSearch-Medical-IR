Antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic assays were performed for the determination of resistance profiles and detection of ESBL and carbapenemase. Further molecular characterization was performed by PCR of ESBL and carbapenemase genes. An analysis of clinical and sociodemographic data of neonates, infants, and pediatric patients was conducted for the identification of potential major risk factors contributing to  The overall prevalence of  The rising prevalence of MDR and XDR  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-025-12157-x.",
