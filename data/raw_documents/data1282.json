    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia, especially in the elderly. Atrial fibrillation often is precipitated by underlying cardiac or noncardiac disease, but it may also occur as 'lone atrial fibrillation'. Hemodynamic impairment and thromboembolic events are leading to an important morbidity, mortality and health costs. This review-article describes the actual management of this common arrhythmia.",
