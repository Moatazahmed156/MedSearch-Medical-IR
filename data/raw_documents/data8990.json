    "abstract": "Circumscribed intraventricular haemorrhages are very rare. The clinical picture showed the symptom of the subarachnoid haemorrhage and additional local symptoms (e.g. hemiparesis, psychic disorders). Neuroradiologically, signs of a space-occupying process in the ventricle are found. A differential diagnosis is not possible. The operation sucks off the haematoma and removes the thin membrane of the haematoma. Sources of the haemorrhage may be damage of the vascular wall, microangiomas and microeneurysms which are destroyed by the haemorrhage.",
