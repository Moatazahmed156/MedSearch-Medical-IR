    "abstract": "The creative viewpoint of SHENG Xie-sun, the master of Zhejiang school of Chinese medicine is introduced regarding the theories of acupuncture-moxibustion and acupoints. It is stated by master SHENG that the five-tissue needling methods are applicable not only for physical disorders, but also for zangfu disorders. Of these methods, the nearby bone needling method presents an instructive significance in treatment of pain disorder. The \"reinforcing in the upper and reducing in the lower\" needling method supplements the reinforcing and reducing theory of acupuncture. Master SHENG has put forward the theory of flexible selection of acupoint, the phenomenon of acupoint groups and the application of transverse acupoint composition, as well as the measures for intensifying needling induction, promoting qi regulation of acupuncture and improving clinical effect. Besides, the seven Chinese characters are used to summarize acupoint composition, meaning \"main point, supplementary point, nearby point, corresponding point, back-shu point, front-mu point and extra point\" separately. This creative viewpoint provides a clearer and more feasible mode in treatment with acupuncture-moxibustion and is instructive proactively in clinical practice.",
