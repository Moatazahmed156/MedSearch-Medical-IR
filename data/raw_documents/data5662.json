    "abstract": "The role of probiotics in regulating intestinal flora to enhance host immunity has recently received widespread attention. Altering the human gut microbiota may increase the predisposition to several disease phenotypes such as gut inflammation and metabolic disorders. The intestinal microbiota converts dietary nutrients into metabolites that serve as biologically active molecules in modulating regulatory functions in the host. Probiotics, which are active microorganisms, play a versatile role in restoring the composition of the gut microbiota, helping to improve host immunity and prevent intestinal disease phenotypes. This comprehensive review provides firsthand information on the gut microbiota and their influence on human health, the dietary effects of diet on the gut microbiota, and how probiotics alter the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, along with their corresponding effects on host immunity in building a healthy intestine. We also discuss the implications of probiotics in some of the most important human diseases. In summary, probiotics play a significant role in regulating the gut microbiota, boosting overall immunity, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, and helping ameliorate the symptoms of multiple diseases.",
