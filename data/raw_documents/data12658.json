  "abstract": "The spatial organization of intratumoral microbiota and its metabolic impact on immunotherapy response in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear, limiting targeted interventions. We integrated single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and microbial multi-omics from a discovery cohort of 23 treatment-naïve CRC patients. Findings were validated in an independent validation cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-CRC,  Spatial depletion of  Our study unveils a spatially defined, microbiome-driven metabolic niche that epigenetically programs CD8",
