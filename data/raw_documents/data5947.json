    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that most stomach carcinomas developed from dysplastic lesions of gastric mucosa. They can be found in known precancerous conditions as chronic gastritis, gastric adenoma, giant rugal hypertrophy, chronic peptic ulcer, gastric stump after partial resection and pernicious anemia. Several grading systems of gastric dysplasia have been suggested. Nagayo's or the ISGGC classification was applied to 367 biopsy specimens of 258 patients between 1979-1995. The frequency of moderate and severe dysplasia was 0,84% regarding all gastric endoscopies in the same period of time. Follow-up studies were performed in 56 cases in a period of 1 7 ys. In this group cancer developed during 14 patients. The authors' recommendation is to follow up the patients gastric dysplasia for least 10 ys after with diagnosis.",
