    "abstract": "The globalization became the topic the most often discussed in the socio-economic field by the media. The direct and indirect effects on the chronic diseases are not fully explored, especially by the biomedicine. Through the filter of the complex thought, which connects instead of disjoining, we try to widen the debate around the diabetes which became an emblematic disease. This change of perspective should enable us to approach the chronic diseases differently. It is the objective of this review.",
