  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease where the synovial lining membrane undergoes pathological changes resulting in joint destruction. In healthy joints, the synovial lining is essential for joint homeostasis, forming a selective barrier and secreting lubricating molecules, yet the mechanisms that restores homeostatic synovial lining during RA remission remains poorly understood. Here, we applied spatial transcriptomics to examine biopsies of RA patients in remission to identify a mechanism that orchestrates a phenotypic switch specifying synovial quiescent lining fibroblast differentiation. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a proximity-sensing program where at low cell-density, fibroblasts adopt proliferative and fibrotic transcriptional state characterized by expression of ",
