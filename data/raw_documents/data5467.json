    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a complex syndrome defined by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. Although sarcopenia is mainly associated with aging, cancer is also one of its causes. Sarcopenia is now drawing attention as a poor prognostic factor in cancer. In patients with gastric cancer associated with eating disorders that often leads to loss of weight and muscle, sarcopenia is particularly important. Its definition and method of assessment, however, vary between studies, thus these need to be standardized. Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests that sarcopenia contributes independently to postoperative complications and overall survival in gastric cancer. Interventions preventing sarcopenia with targeted nutrition and exercise are currently explored. This review aims to provide an understanding of sarcopenia, emphasizing its importance in the management of gastric cancer.",
