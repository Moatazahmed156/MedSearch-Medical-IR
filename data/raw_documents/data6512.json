    "abstract": "While psychogenic aspects in ulcerative colitis have been comprehensively studied, much less attention has been given to sequence and interaction of psychic and somatic factors in psychopathological description. Onset of schizoaffective and cyclothymic symptomatology in 20 ulcerative colitis patients proved to occur only after somatic manifestation. As later on organic and psychic relapse never occurred simultaneously, further discussion should be centered on two points: Does schizoaffective cyclothymic axial syndrome occur separately from ulcerative colitis manifestation? Or is there a common etiological, pathogenic base for both somatic and psychic symptoms?",
