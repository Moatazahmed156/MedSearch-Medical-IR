  "abstract": "Trials comparing the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation against no exercise-based rehabilitation are needed, but their feasibility is unclear. The DRAW-TKA feasibility trial aimed to assess recruitment-, retention-, harms-, and procedural feasibility to inform a full-scale effectiveness trial. This pragmatic, multicentre, parallel, two-arm feasibility trial included participants scheduled for total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis, aged ≥18, who could read and write Danish. Participants were recruited pre-operatively from two hospitals. At discharge, participants were encouraged to be physically active and randomised (one-to-one) to \"Referral to exercise\" (usual care) or \"No exercise\". Recruiters, outcome assessors, and intervention-deliverers were masked to allocation. The primary feasibility criteria were based on recruitment rate, retention, participation barriers, and data completeness. Secondary criteria on harms, procedural feasibility, and intervention acceptance. Between Aug 22nd The trial's scientific rationale - allocation to exercise, or no exercise - introduced significant risk of selection and attrition bias in this clinical context, severely limiting the generalisability. Although recruitment was predominantly feasible, further adaptations are required to warrant full-scale initiation.NCT05935020.",
