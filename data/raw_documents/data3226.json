    "abstract": "Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is non-inflammatory obstructive vasculopathy commonly affecting patients with advanced atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, or elevated cholesterol levels, and subjects with other risk factors such as cigarette smoking.Two Caucasian patients (a 55-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man), with ulcerous cutaneous lesions of AIOD are reported. In both cases, medical history comprises initial lower limb claudication, multiple painful ulcers along the legs and absence of superficial femoral artery pulse. Severe obstruction of both infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries on the left side was demonstrated by contrast angiography and Doppler ultrasonography.The evolution of the disease showed some characteristic findings, including pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcerations as the initial cutaneous manifestation of AIOD, multiple painful ulcers along the lower extremities, and aorto-iliac occlusive disease due to atherosclerosis.Early diagnosis and surgical reconstruction of vessels in patients with AIOD improved quality of life and limb salvage rates.",
