    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men in Europe and the USA. The incidence of prostate cancer has risen by 60-75% in the Western world in the last 15 years. One in twelve men over the age of 60 develop prostate cancer and this figure is expected to rise to three in twelve in the next 20 years. Early prostate cancer often does not cause symptoms. However, patients may present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and therefore, such patients should be investigated. Effective treatment in the form of surgery and radiotherapy is availabLe for individuals with localised disease, and the effectiveness of different combination therapy is being assessed to improve the outcome further. Approximately 20% of the patients have metastatic disease on presentation. The mainstay of treatment for these patients is androgen ablation therapy; however patients on this regime eventually relapse and develop an androgen independent tumour. This aggressive stage of the disease carries a high morbidity and mortality. At present the treatment for such hormone refractory prostate cancer is inadequate and the desperate search for alternative forms of therapy continues.",
