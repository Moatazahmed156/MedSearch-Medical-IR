    "abstract": "Prediction of neurological clinical outcome after acute brain injury is critical because it helps guide discussions with patients and families and informs treatment plans and allocation of resources. Numerous clinical grading scales have been published that aim to support prognostication after acute brain injury. However, the development and validation of clinical scales lack a standardized approach. This in turn makes it difficult for clinicians to rely on prognostic grading scales and to integrate them into clinical practice. In this review, we discuss quality measures of score development and validation and summarize available scales to prognosticate outcomes after acute brain injury. These include scales developed for patients with coma, cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury; for each scale, we discuss available validation studies.",
