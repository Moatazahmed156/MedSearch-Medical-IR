    "abstract": "Food craving is a common phenomenon during pregnancy. This behaviour may be influenced by personality traits that have been known to be linked with obesity and addiction affecting pregnancy outcomes. We identified the prevalence of food cravings and evaluated its relationship with personality traits in pregnant women. We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving 500 healthy pregnant women in an urban area of Jakarta, Indonesia. Food cravings were assessed using a translated and validated Food Craving Inventory of the Indonesian version. Personality traits were determined by using a Big Five Personality Trait Short Questionnaire that has been translated and validated for Indonesians. Associations of personality traits and food cravings were analysed by binary logistic regression. The mean age of pregnant women was 28.3 ± 5.3 years. The food craving prevalence in this population was 63.8%. The most common personality trait in this study was conscientiousness (65.5%). The neuroticism trait was significantly associated with food cravings, with an OR of 9.146 [95% CI: 2.76-30.4; p-value < 0.05]. A large proportion of pregnant women had food cravings living in Jakarta. Neuroticism trait has a strong association with food cravings during pregnancy.",
