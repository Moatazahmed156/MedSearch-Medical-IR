    "abstract": "Tetraplegia resulting from cervical injury is the most frequent neurologic category after spinal cord injury and causes substantial disability. The residual strength of partially paralyzed muscles is an important determinant of independence and function in tetraplegia. Small improvements in upper extremity function can make a clinically significant difference in daily activities. Major advances in rehabilitation technologies over the past 2 decades have allowed testing of robotic devices in rehabilitation of motor impairments. This literature assessment provides an overview of robotic-assisted training research for improving arm and hand functions after cervical spinal cord injury.",
