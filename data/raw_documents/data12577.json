  "title": "Genetically induced mouse model for colon-specific epithelial cell tumorigenesis driven by loss of K8 and Apc.",
  "abstract": "Loss of keratin 8 (K8) has been shown to increase susceptibility towards colonocyte hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis. However, most colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse models require carcinogen, develop small intestinal tumors or have a long latency period. The aim was to establish a genetic, colon-specific and more human like CRC model driven by loss of K8 and Apc. Colon-specific targeting using CDX2P-CreER K8 Genetic colon-specific mouse model with loss of K8 and Apc adequately resembles human CRC. This study identifies anti-tumorigenic protective roles of colonocyte K8 in the colon.",
