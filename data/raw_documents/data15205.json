  "title": "Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis in Focus: Pathogenesis, Non-Invasive Diagnostics, and Future Approaches.",
  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become a critical public health concern, representing the progressive form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). MASH is characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis, which increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, MASH affects a significant proportion of the global population, requiring accurate diagnostic tools and tailored interventions. This manuscript delves into the current understanding of MASH, focusing on its pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and innovative non-invasive strategies. While liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, its invasiveness and limitations have prompted the search for alternative approaches. Promising non-invasive techniques, such as elastography, MRI-based techniques, and serum biomarkers like cytokeratin-18, NIS4, and FAST scores, provide new ways to detect MASH and evaluate fibrosis severity. The updated MASLD criteria refine risk stratification further, capturing a broader range of at-risk individuals, including lean phenotypes. As MASH continues to strain healthcare systems worldwide, this review underscores the importance of advancing non-invasive diagnostics and integrating multi-omics approaches. Future research should focus on developing personalized strategies to halt disease progression, enhance early detection, and optimize patient outcomes.",
