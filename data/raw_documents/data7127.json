    "abstract": "Back pain has to be classified by localisation, duration, and existence or absence of neurological deficits. Therapy mainly depends on the severity of neurological symptoms. The time period between the onset of symptoms and efficient therapy should be short in order to prevent the development of chronic pain. Therefore a sufficient, consistent and evidence-based conservative treatment should be initiated early on, with the only exception of special emergency situations as described further down in this article. Patients should not be immobilized, a better outcome is proven in patients who immediately continued practising their daily activities. First line medication consists of non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAID). If necessary, opioids and muscle-relaxants may be applied additionally. Surgical procedures are only indicated in a small number of patients. A sufficient data base with regard to the benefit of acupuncture, orthesis, and chiropractic medicine is lacking. Local injections should only be done in very special cases. Concerning chronic back pain a multimodal, multi-disciplinary pain treatment concept with physical training and behavioural therapy should be applied in order to teach the patient to avoid a passive and maladjusted attitude. Antidepressant drugs may also be indicated in chronic back pain.",
