    "abstract": "The purpose of this systematic review was to identify evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of behavioral weight loss interventions for overweight and obese cardiac rehabilitation participants. A database search of PUBMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PROSPERO yielded 10 eligible studies. Quantitative studies implementing behavioral weight loss interventions for overweight and obese adult cardiac rehabilitation participants were reviewed. Evidence supported the usefulness and effectiveness of behavioral weight loss interventions for overweight cardiac rehabilitation participants. With the limited number of studies and inclusion of quasi-experimental studies with comparative groups, it was not possible to determine the relative power of behavioral weight loss interventions across studies. In conclusion, behavioral weight loss interventions can be incorporated into cardiac rehabilitation or offered following cardiac rehabilitation to improve weight loss of overweight and obese cardiac rehabilitation participants. Findings reinforce national guidelines emphasizing the role of cardiac rehabilitation to address secondary cardiovascular disease risk factor modification, including integrating behavioral weight loss programs in cardiac rehabilitation, or referring overweight patients to weight management programs following completion of cardiac rehabilitation.",
