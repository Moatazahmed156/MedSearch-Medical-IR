  "abstract": "Environmental pollutants can induce multiorgan damage, with the digestive tract particularly susceptible. Diabetic enteropathy is a significant complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, the relationship between environmental pollutant exposure and T2D-associated intestinal injury has not been previously explored. In this study, T2D mice were subjected to polystyrene microplastics (",
