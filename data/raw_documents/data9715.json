  "title": "Adrenal cavernous hemangioma misdiagnosed as pheochromocytoma: a case report.",
  "abstract": "A case of a 62-year-old male presenting with persistent abdominal pain and hypertension is reported. Upon admission, elevated urinary vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid levels were noted. Imaging revealed an 8.2 cm left adrenal mass, initially suspected as pheochromocytoma. Laparoscopic resection was performed. Pathology confirmed adrenal cavernous hemangioma (CD31/CD34+). The preoperative misdiagnosis resulted from the tumor's clinical features (hypertension, elevated catecholamine metabolites) and imaging characteristics mimicking pheochromocytoma. Adrenal cavernous hemangioma is susceptible to preoperative misdiagnosis. Surgery provides definitive diagnosis and treatment.",
