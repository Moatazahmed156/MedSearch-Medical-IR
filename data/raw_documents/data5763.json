    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal surgery is often challenging because of unexpected postoperative complications such as pouchitis, malabsorption, anastomotic leak, diarrhea, inflammatory responses, and life-threatening infections. Moreover, the gut microbiota has been shown to be associated with the complications described above. Major intestinal reconstruction, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery, could result in altered gut microbiota, which might lead to some of the benefits of these procedures but could also contribute to the development of postsurgical complications. Moreover, postsurgical reestablishment of the gut microbiota population is still poorly understood. Here, we review evidence outlining the role of gut microbiota in complications of gastrointestinal surgery, especially malabsorption, anastomotic leak, pouchitis, and infections. In addition, this review will evaluate the risks and benefits of live biotherapeutics in the complications of gastrointestinal surgery.",
