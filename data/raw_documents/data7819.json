    "abstract": "Obstructive kidney disease is a common urologic diagnosis and includes kidney stones, polycystic kidney disease, and renal artery stenosis. Kidney stones are a common emergency department admission in the United States. Men are affected more than women. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic renal disease that may not reveal symptoms until an individual reaches age 30 years. Renal artery stenosis contributes to decreased perfusion to the kidneys, which contributes to hypertension and end-stage renal disease.",
