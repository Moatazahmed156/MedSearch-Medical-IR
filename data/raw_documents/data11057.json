  "title": "Cost-effectiveness modeling of mortality risk reduction comparing two fixed-dose combination triple therapies in moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
  "abstract": "What is this article about? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious lung disease that makes breathing difficult and worsens over time. COPD greatly impacts healthcare systems and a person’s quality of life. This study examined two inhaler treatments for COPD: budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (BGF) and fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI). We aimed to understand which treatment was more effective at lowering healthcare costs, improving quality of life and reducing death in a UK setting. What methodology/protocol is described? COPD guidelines recognize that BGF and FF/UMEC/VI lower the risk of death, but a comparison of costs is lacking. A cost-effectiveness model was developed using phase III clinical trials with BGF and a published matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison study of BGF and FF/UMEC/VI. The model evaluated the total healthcare costs and health benefits of BGF and FF/UMEC/VI inhaler treatments over 1- and 5-year periods in COPD that worsened over time. What were the results? The model showed that BGF was less costly and more effective compared with FF/UMEC/VI because it reduced deaths, which led to lower end-of-life care costs, even when taking BGF for a longer period. Why is this important? This study suggests that BGF not only improves patient health outcomes but could also reduce healthcare costs within the duration of 1 to 5 years. The findings support the use of BGF as a cost-effective treatment for patients with COPD, which may lead to better management of this disease.",
