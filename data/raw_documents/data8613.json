    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex and long-term process consisting of hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation/remodeling. These four stages overlap and influence each other; they affect wound healing in different ways, and if they do not function perfectly, they may cause scarring, proliferative scarring and keloid formation. A therapeutic target affecting wound healing in multiple ways will help the healing process proceed more effectively. DPP-4/CD26 is a multifunctional dimorphic glycoprotein widely distributed on the surface of a variety of cells, including fibroblasts and keratin-forming cells. It has been found to affect periwound inflammation, re-epithelialization, extracellular matrix secretion and skin fibrosis and is a potential target for promoting wound healing and inhibiting scar formation. After presenting a brief introduction of the wound healing process and DPP-4/CD26, this paper summarizes the effects of DPP-4/CD26 on cells involved in different stages of wound healing and discusses the feasibility of DPP-4/CD26 as a multifunctional target for the treatment of wound healing and inhibition of scar formation.",
