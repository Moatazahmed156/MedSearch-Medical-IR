    "abstract": "Genetic testing plays an important role in assessing breast cancer risk and often the risk of other types of cancers. Accurate risk assessment and stratification represents a critical element of identifying who is best served by increased surveillance and consideration of other prevention or treatment options while also limiting overtreatment and unnecessary testing. The indications for testing will likely continue to expand, and ideally, more women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer will be identified before they are diagnosed with breast cancer and thus have the option to consider effective screening and prevention management strategies.",
