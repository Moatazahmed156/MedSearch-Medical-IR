    "abstract": "Management of large trunk wounds begins with good wound management and bandaging. When a healthy wound bed exists and adequate tissue is present, the wound is closed. Fortunately, there is an abundance of loose trunk skin in most animals, and wound closure can be accomplished by simple reconstructive techniques, such as undermining and tension or \"walking sutures.\" Nevertheless, some wounds and areas of the torso may require more advanced tension-relieving techniques, skin stretching, and tissue implants or flaps to achieve tension-free closure and successful wound healing. Use of these techniques allows wound closure and good cosmetic results for even those wounds that initially may seem foreboding.",
