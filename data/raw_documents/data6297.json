    "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia, a prevalent condition in aging men, is characterized by the proliferation of prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, which leads to bladder outlet obstruction and the exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms. There is increasing evidence that chronic prostatic inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review explores the complex relationship between chronic inflammation and benign prostatic hyperplasia, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, clinical implications, and current therapeutic approaches. The pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia is multifaceted, involving factors such as hormonal changes, hypoxia, urine reflux into prostatic ducts and stroma, autoimmune responses, and infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-17 and interleukin-8, may play key roles in tissue remodeling and smooth muscle contraction within the prostate, thereby influencing benign prostatic hyperplasia progression. Current therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia include α1-blockers, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, 5α-reductase inhibitors, and plant-based treatments (e.g., pollen extract). These therapies aim to alleviate symptoms by reducing prostatic inflammation, improving blood flow, and inhibiting hormonal pathways involved in prostatic enlargement. However, patients with chronic prostatic inflammation often experience more severe lower urinary tract symptoms and may be resistant to conventional treatments. This resistance has prompted the exploration of alternative therapies targeting inflammation. Chronic prostatic inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis and severity of benign prostatic hyperplasia. An understanding of its mechanisms will enable the development of more effective treatments to improve the quality of life among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.",
