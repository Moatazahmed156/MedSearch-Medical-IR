    "abstract": "Premature ovarian failure is a heterogeneous disease that brings about several health risks. We must consider that the use of contraception in adolescent girls can mask this disease for a long time. Assisted reproductive technology has brought hope to women with premature ovarian failure to have their own child. Substitution of hormonal deficiency is important for eliminating unpleasant feelings associated with premature ovarian failure as well as for reducing the risk of late effects. Keywords: premature ovarian failure, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, amenorrhea, gonadal dysgenesis, cryopreservation.",
