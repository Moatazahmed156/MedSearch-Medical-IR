  "title": "Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro by Repurposing Clinically Approved Drugs.",
  "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus contains two highly conserved domains, the papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro), which play important roles in virus replication, immune suppression, and the induction of inflammation in host tissue. In this study, we applied small-molecule chip screening, enzymatic assays, SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus detection and molecular docking to find potential Mpro or PLpro inhibitors. Two small molecules, oxytocin and risedronate sodium, stood out in drug repurposing. Oxytocin and risedronate sodium were shown to influence the activities of Mpro and PLpro, thereby preventing the virus from replication, which may alleviate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, oxytocin, risedronate sodium, and cephalosporins may expand the drug library for treating coronavirus infection.",
