    "abstract": "HNC is the 11th most frequent carcinoma with a world-wide yearly incidence exceeding over half a million cases [1], a 10:1 male gender predilection and country specific variability [2]. The principal risk factors are tobacco and alcohol use and, in a growing population without these exposures, HPV infection. While much progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of cancer, the 5-year mortality of head and neck cancer has remained approximately 50%. To this date we have not been able to translate as much of our basic science knowledge into significant disease altering therapeutic strategies in terms of local, loco-regional, functional and overall survival. Challenges remain in all aspects of head and neck cancer management: prevention, diagnosis, surgical and non-surgical treatment.",
