  "abstract": "Primary familial basal ganglia calcification (PFBC), also known as Fahr's disease, is a rare neurodegenerative condition characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. While it predominantly presents in adulthood and is commonly associated with heterozygous mutations, rare homozygous pathogenic variants may lead to severe early-onset manifestations. We present a unique case of PFBC in a 2-month-old female infant who exhibited focal motor seizures shortly after routine immunization. Neuroimaging revealed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications, multifocal cerebral infarcts, and evidence of significant intra-arterial cerebral vasculopathy. Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous pathogenic variant in the ",
