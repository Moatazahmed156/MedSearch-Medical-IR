    "abstract": "Yellow fever and dengue are old diseases, having caused major epidemics in centuries past. Both were effectively controlled in the mid 1900s, yellow fever in Francophone Africa by vaccination and yellow fever and dengue in the Americas by effective control of the principal urban vector of both viruses, Aedes aegypti. In the last 25 years of the 20th century, however, there was a resurgence of yellow fever in Africa, and of dengue worldwide. The factors responsible for this resurgence are discussed, as are current options for prevention and control.",
