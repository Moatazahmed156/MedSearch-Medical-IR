  "title": "PUFAs-enriched oil bodies as natural anti-osteoarthritis drug delivery platforms.",
  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative condition that leads to cartilage degradation, joint pain, and functional impairment, with few effective treatment options available. Curcumin (Cur), a polyphenol with potential therapeutic benefits for OA, is constrained by its poor solubility and bioavailability. In this study, we developed an innovative Cur delivery platform utilizing flaxseed-derived oil bodies (OBs), which are naturally enriched with ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that exhibit significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. We demonstrated that OBs could efficiently encapsulate Cur via a pH-driven method, significantly improving its aqueous dispersibility and bioavailability. The Cur-loaded OBs (Cur/OBs) exhibited superior anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects by reducing intracellular ROS, alleviating inflammation, and preventing chondrocyte apoptosis. Additionally, Cur/OBs promoted the polarization of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages to M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages through the PPARγ/NF-κB signaling pathway. In an experimental rat OA model, Cur/OBs significantly mitigated the progression of OA, outperforming free Cur and OBs alone. These findings suggest that PUFAs-enriched OBs are an effective carrier for Cur, offering a synergistic therapeutic strategy for OA.",
