    "abstract": "The mechanisms of atrial fibrillation relate to the presence of random reentry involving multiple interatrial circuits. Triggers for development of atrial fibrillation include rapidly discharging atrial foci (mainly from pulmonary veins) or degeneration of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia into fibrillation. Therapy for control of atrial fibrillation includes drugs, atrial pacing for those with sinus node dysfunction, or ablation of the atrioventricular junction. Therapeutic maneuvers for cure of atrial fibrillation include surgical or radiofrequency catheter induced linear lesions to reduce the atrial tissue and prevent the requisite number of reentrant wavelets. We need a much better understanding of basic mechanisms before a true cure is at hand.",
