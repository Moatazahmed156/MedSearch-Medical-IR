  "title": "The clinical implications of zinc and copper levels in COPD patients: a narrative review.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of global morbidity and the third leading cause of death, significantly impairs quality of life. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are critical micronutrients that support antioxidant defense, immune function, and inflammation regulation, processes critical to COPD pathology. This review investigates evidence linking serum Cu and Zn levels to COPD severity, progression, and exacerbation. Elevated Cu and Zn levels, along with the Cu/Zn ratio, correlate with COPD exacerbation and may serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers by reflecting inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. However, well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm their impact on COPD outcomes. This review clarifies the clinical role of Cu and Zn in COPD and explores their potential as supplementary treatments to mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress. Future research should focus on their therapeutic applications to improve COPD management.",
