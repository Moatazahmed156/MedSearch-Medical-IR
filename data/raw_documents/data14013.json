  "title": "[Chinese expert consensus on the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with Janus kinase inhibitors].",
  "abstract": "In recent years, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been gradually approved for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), including rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. To standardize the application of JAK inhibitors in IMIDs, the expert group of this consensus has formulated the Chinese expert consensus on the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with Janus kinase inhibitors, based on the latest research data, relevant guidelines, domestic and international literature, and clinical practice experience of the experts. This consensus provides a comprehensive introduction to treatment regimens, safety management, and medication use in specific populations, aiming to assist clinicians in making reasonable clinical decisions. 近年来Janus激酶（JAK）抑制剂已获批用于治疗类风湿关节炎、中轴型脊柱关节炎、银屑病关节炎、幼年特发性关节炎、巨细胞动脉炎、特应性皮炎、斑秃、银屑病和炎症性肠病等免疫介导炎症性疾病（IMIDs）。为了规范JAK抑制剂在IMIDs的应用，本共识专家组基于相关循证证据、国内外最新研究数据和专家临床实践经验，制定了《Janus激酶抑制剂治疗免疫介导炎症性疾病中国专家共识》。共识涵盖了JAK抑制剂治疗IMIDs的使用方案、安全性管理和特殊人群用药等内容，以协助医生做出合理的临床决策。.",
