    "abstract": "This study explores factors related to quality of life and successful aging in long-term care from the perspective of residents. Thirty-two residents from a long-term care facility rated factors related to quality of life and responded to open-ended items on quality of life and successful aging. Although experiencing health problems and disability, residents were optimistic about their health and quality of life. Factors identified as important to their quality of life included: interaction with family and friends, personal qualities, \"room and board\" items, and aspects of well-being. Notably, two factors--enjoying nature and being helpful to others--have not been widely reported in the literature but were identified here. Future research might explore other factors not traditionally associated with quality of life in long-term care.",
