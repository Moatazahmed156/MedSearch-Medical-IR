    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Rats are experimental animals, frequently used as model organisms in the biomedical studies, and increasingly used to study the gut microbiota. Specifically, the aim of latter studies is either the elucidation of relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and diseases or the determination of nutrients or pharmaceutical agents which can cause the modulation in the presence or abundance of gut microbiota.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      Herein, the research studies conducted on the gut microbiota of healthy rats are presented in a summarized and concise overview. The focus is on studies aimed to reveal the shifts in microbial composition and functional changes after exposure to various types of nutritional supplements.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed the search of PubMed database using the term \"rat gut microbiome microbiota\" and examined studies aimed to assess the composition of gut microbiota in physiological homeostasis as well as the effect of various nutritional supplements on the gut microbiota of healthy rats.",
