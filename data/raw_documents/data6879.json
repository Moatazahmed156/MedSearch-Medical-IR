    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in regulating the exchange of substances between peripheral blood and the central nervous system and in maintaining the stability of the neurovascular unit in neurological diseases. To guide clinical treatment and basic research on BBB protection following brain injury, this manuscript reviews how BBB disruption develops and influences neural recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). By summarizing the pathological mechanisms of BBB damage, we underscore the critical role of promoting BBB repair in managing brain injury. We also emphasize the potential for personalized and precise therapeutic strategies and the need for continued research and innovation. From this, broadening insights into the mechanisms of BBB disruption and repair could pave the way for breakthroughs in the treatment of brain injury-related diseases.",
