    "abstract": "Similar to other organs, renal lymphatics remove excess fluid, solutes, and macromolecules from the renal interstitium. Given the kidney's unique role in maintaining body fluid homeostasis, renal lymphatics may be critical in this process. However, little is known regarding the pathways involved in renal lymphatic vessel function, and there are no studies on the effects of drugs targeting impaired interstitial clearance, such as diuretics. Using pressure myography, we showed that renal lymphatic collecting vessels are sensitive to changes in transmural pressure and have an optimal range of effective pumping. In addition, they are responsive to vasoactive factors known to regulate tone in other lymphatic vessels including prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, and their spontaneous contractility requires Ca2+ and Cl-. We also demonstrated that Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter Nkcc1, but not Nkcc2, is expressed in extrarenal lymphatic vessels. Furosemide, a loop diuretic that inhibits Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters, induced a dose-dependent dilation in lymphatic vessels and decreased the magnitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions, thereby reducing the ability of these vessels to propel lymph. Ethacrynic acid, another loop diuretic, had no effect on vessel tone. These data represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying renal lymphatic vessel function and highlight potential off-target effects of furosemide that may exacerbate fluid accumulation in edema-forming conditions.",
