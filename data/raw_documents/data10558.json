  "title": "Dietary protein intake and asthma in US children and adolescents: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data.",
  "abstract": "Evidence regarding total dietary protein intake remains inconsistent and limited for the US pediatric population. This study utilizes nationally representative data to examine the association between total dietary protein intake and asthma prevalence, thereby addressing this research gap. A cross-sectional study that involved 4825 people used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2020. The relationship between total protein intake and asthma was investigated using multiple linear regression models. The linear relationship between the two was tested using a restricted cubic spline. Stratified analysis further confirms the stability of the findings. All eligible participants (N = 4,825; mean age 10.6 ± 2.9 years; 49.7% male) were analyzed. The fully-adjusted model revealed a positive association between total protein consumption and asthma after controlling for confounders. Compared to the lowest intake quartile Q1 (≤ 3.966 mg/day), adjusted odds ratios for asthma in Q2 (3.967-6.364 mg/day) and Q3 (≥ 6.365 mg/day) were 0.097 (95%CI:0.97-1.44, p = 0.097) and 0.036 (95%CI:1.01-1.55, p = 0.036), respectively. A dose-response relationship (p = 0.037) emerged between total protein consumption and asthma risk. Total dietary protein intake demonstrated a positive association with asthma among US children and adolescents. These findings are statistically significant.",
