    "abstract": "Following spinal cord injury, muscles below the level of injury develop variable degrees of disuse atrophy. The present study assessed the physiological changes of the expiratory muscles in a cat model of spinal cord injury. Muscle fiber typing, cross-sectional area, muscle weight, and changes in pressure-generating capacity were assessed in five cats spinalized at the T(6) level. Airway pressure (P)-generating capacity was monitored during lower thoracic spinal cord stimulation before and 6 mo after spinalization. These parameters were also assessed in five acute animals, which served as controls. In spinalized animals, P fell from 41 +/- l to 28 +/- 3 cm H2O (means +/- SE; P < 0.001). Muscle weight of the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and internal intercostal muscles decreased significantly (P < 0.05 for each). Muscle weight of the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and internal intercostal, but not rectus abdominis (RA), correlated linearly with P (r > 0.7 for each; P < 0.05 for each). Mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area of these muscles was significantly smaller (P < 0.05 for each; except RA) and also correlated linearly with P (r > 0.55 for each; P < 0.05 for each, except RA). In spinalized animals, the expiratory muscles demonstrated a significant increase in the population of fast muscle fibers. These results indicate that, following spinalization, 1) the expiratory muscles undergo significant atrophy and fiber-type transformation and 2) the P-generating capacity of the expiratory muscles falls significantly secondary to reductions in muscle mass.",
