  "title": "Optimization of memory neurofeedback system utilizing intracranial electroencephalogram of the hippocampus.",
  "abstract": "Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) suffer from epileptic seizures and memory decline. While focal resection eliminates seizures in 60-70% of patients, surgery carries the risk of further compromising memory. We hypothesized that hippocampal neurofeedback (NF) will induce targeted brain activity associated with memory function. Patients with intracranial electrodes implanted in bilateral hippocampi performed a memory NF task, developed specifically for this project. The NF task involved real-time analysis of hippocampal activity using the electrode in the less-affected hippocampus while conducting a memory task. Changes in theta activity and task performance were assessed. The NF task was conducted in seven TLE patients. In five patients, theta activity increased significantly in the targeted hippocampus (Mann-Kendall test; p < 0.05). Mixed linear model analysis across all sessions revealed a significant increase in theta activity in the targeted hippocampus (p = 0.0032), with no significant change contralaterally (p = 0.19). Three additional TLE patients underwent random NF to assess if theta activity was induced merely by the encoding process, but none of them showed significant changes in theta activity. Memory NF task effectively induced targeted hippocampal activity in TLE patients. Hippocampal NF may enhance memory function in TLE patients prior to focal resection.",
