    "abstract": "The number of patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) has been rising due to increased incidence, enhanced detection methods, and greater survival rates following diagnosis. Due to this increase, AF is now the most commonly diagnosed arrhythmia in clinical practice. AF is characterized by irregular, high-frequency contractions of atrial myocytes that lead to turbulent blood flow and the potential for thrombus formation, stroke, or heart failure. These high-frequency contractions of the atrial myocytes cause an imbalance between metabolic supply and demand. Although advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of AF, the etiology and underlying pathogenic mechanism remain unknown. However, recent evidence suggests that cardiomyocyte metabolism involving 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation is altered in patients with AF. Here, we critically reviewed the current understanding of AMPK activation in AF and how it could affect structural, contractile, and electrophysiological cellular properties in the pathogenesis of AF.",
