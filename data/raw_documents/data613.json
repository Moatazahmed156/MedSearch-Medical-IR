    "abstract": "Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a rare, indolent form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from B cells in the marginal zone of lymphoid tissues. MZL comprises 3 key subtypes: extranodal, nodal, and splenic MZL. Despite being generally slow growing, MZL presents significant challenges due to its heterogeneous nature, inconsistently defined disease, and the limited efficacy and availability of current treatments. Advancements in targeted therapies and a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of MZL are critical to improving patient outcomes and achieving more durable remissions. At the Lymphoma Research Foundation's 2024 Marginal Zone Lymphoma Virtual Scientific Workshop, researchers gathered to discuss recent developments in both basic scientific and clinical research so that together we can continue to develop our understanding of MZL and improve outcomes for patients. This report, which includes a summary of each presentation, aims to review the findings presented at the workshop. Additionally, it highlights opportunities, reviews questions, and assesses areas for future study to set the stage for treatment advancements in the coming decades.",
