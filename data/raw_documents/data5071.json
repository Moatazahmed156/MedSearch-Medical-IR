    "abstract": "A fundamental question in developmental immunology is how bipotential thymocyte precursors generate both CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lineages. The MHC specificity of αβ T cell receptors (TCRs) on precursors is closely correlated with cell fate-determining processes, prompting studies to characterize how variations in TCR signaling are linked with genetic programs establishing lineage-specific gene expression signatures, such as exclusive CD4 or CD8 expression. The key transcription factors ThPOK and Runx3 have been identified as mediating development of helper and cytotoxic T cell lineages, respectively. Together with increasing knowledge of epigenetic regulators, these findings have advanced our understanding of the transcription factor network regulating the CD4/CD8 dichotomy. It has also become apparent that CD4+ T cells retain developmental plasticity, allowing them to acquire cytotoxic activity in the periphery. Despite such advances, further studies are necessary to identify the molecular links between TCR signaling and the nuclear machinery regulating expression of ThPOK and Runx3.",
