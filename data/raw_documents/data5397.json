    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunctions are significantly implicated in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, which have been shown for several cancers including ovarian cancer.An increase in mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with drug resistance along with cancer progression, which in part is related to its specific microenvironment that is characterized by ascites, low glucose levels, and hypoxia that causes ovarian cancer cells to switch to mitochondrial respiration to enable their survival. Peritoneal ascitic fluid accumulation is a specific feature of ovarian cancer, and it is a major cause of its metastatic spread that also presents challenges for effective treatment. Among the treatment difficulties for ovarian cancer is the mutation rate and frequency of mtDNA in ovarian cancer tissue that can affect the efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs. The varied and multiple mutations of different types enable metabolic reprogramming, cancer cell proliferation, and drug resistance.New specific information on mechanisms underlying several of the mitochondrial dysfunctions has led to proposing various mitochondrial determinants as targets for ovarian cancer therapy, which include targeting specific mitochondrial proteins and phosphoproteins as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate abnormally in cancer cells. Because of the genetically and histologically heterogeneous nature of the disease, combination therapy approaches will be necessary to combat the disease and achieve progress in effective treatment of ovarian cancer. This chapter will address (1) mitochondrial vulnerabilities underlying dysfunction and disease; (2) mitochondrial dysfunction in ovarian cancer; (3) present treatment difficulties for ovarian cancer and new potential treatment strategies to target ovarian cancer mitochondrial metabolism; and (4) biobehavioral factors influencing ovarian cancer development.",
