    "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in developed countries. There are no uniform recommendations for endometrial cancer screening in the general population. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the primary physician profoundly understands, and is familiar with the methods for prevention and early detection of endometrial cancer. The aim of this review is to provide the primary physician with a toolbox to reach these goals.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a systemic review to summarize the current strategies to diagnose and prevent endometrial cancer. Many published articles from the last years were identified and included.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A systematic review that summarizes the important subjects in the diagnosis and prevention of endometrial cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Maintaining a high index of suspicion and obtaining endometrial biopsies from all suspected patients is the key for achieving a timely diagnosis.",
