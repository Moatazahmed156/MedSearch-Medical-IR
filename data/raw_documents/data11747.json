  "title": "Clinical outcomes of breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer: A retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "The best surgical approach for early-stage breast cancer is still under debate, particularly in the context of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy. A retrospective cohort study of 132 patients treated with BCS or mastectomy over 5 years of follow-up compared outcomes related to overall survival, disease-free survival, recurrence, and complications. Outcomes were similar in each group but higher recurrence was associated with BCS and better cosmetic and psychological outcomes. Mastectomy had lower recurrence but additional morbidity associated with treatment. These findings are an important step in advocating for shared decision-making with individualized treatment options.",
