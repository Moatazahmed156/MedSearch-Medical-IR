    "abstract": "Transrectal ultrasound now plays a central part in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The role of ultrasound in prostate cancer diagnosis is to guide accurate biopsy, and current practice favours a systematic biopsy approach rather than targeted biopsy of focal abnormalities. The role of colour and power Doppler and sonographic contrast agents in prostate cancer diagnosis is still under evaluation, but these techniques may have a role in the assessment of the prognosis of an individual cancer.",
