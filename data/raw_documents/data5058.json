    "abstract": "T-cell lymphoproliferative processes in the spleen are rare and it is important to study normal T cell subsets in the spleen to understand the splenic milieu in which they arise. True malignant T-cell processes including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma and T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia occur in the spleen, but other atypical reactive T-cell proliferations and those of uncertain significance also have been described. Proper distinction of florid T cell responses from malignant T-cell neoplasms has important therapeutic implications for the patient.",
