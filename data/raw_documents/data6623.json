    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common tachyarrhythmias observed in the clinic and is characterized by structural and electrical remodelling. Atrial fibrosis, an emblem of atrial structural remodelling, is a complex multifactorial and patient‑specific process involved in the occurrence and maintenance of AF. Whilst there is already considerable knowledge regarding the association between AF and fibrosis, this process is extremely complex, involving intricate neurohumoral and cellular and molecular interactions, and it is not limited to the atrium. Current technological advances have made the non‑invasive evaluation of fibrosis in the atria and ventricles possible, facilitating the selection of patient‑specific ablation strategies and upstream treatment regimens. An improved understanding of the mechanisms and roles of fibrosis in the context of AF is of great clinical significance for the development of treatment strategies targeting the fibrous region. In the present review, a focus was placed on the atrial fibrosis underlying AF, outlining its role in the occurrence and perpetuation of AF, by reviewing recent evaluations and potential treatment strategies targeting areas of fibrosis, with the aim of providing a novel perspective on the management and prevention of AF.",
