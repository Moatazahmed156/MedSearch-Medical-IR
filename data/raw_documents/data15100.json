  "abstract": "In order to evaluate emerging imaging strategies for optimizing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) assessment in liver transplantation (LT) candidates, addressing gaps in standardization, diagnostic ambiguity, and equitable access. Critical analysis of current evidence and innovations in CCA imaging, focusing on three pillars: (1) Adaptation of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System for standardized reporting; (2) Integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven radiomics for risk stratification; and (3) Expanded utilization of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in resource-limited settings. Current imaging criteria for LT eligibility in CCA rely heavily on tumor size and vascular invasion, but lack standardized protocols for lesion characterization in cirrhotic livers. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System, validated for hepatocellular carcinoma, shows promise in reducing interobserver variability when adapted to CCA-specific features (",
