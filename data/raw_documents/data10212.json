  "abstract": "Clinical significance and correlation study of methyltransferase Wilms' tumour 1-associated protein (WTAP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This study enrolled 282 symptomatic patients with suspected CAD. Serum biomarkers including lipids, inflammatory markers (CRP, Lp-PLA2), and WTAP mRNA levels (quantified via RT-PCR) were analyzed. Coronary severity was assessed using Gensini scores. CAD patients exhibited significantly elevated WTAP expression and higher Lp-PLA2 levels. WTAP correlated strongly with Lp-PLA2, CRP, and Gensini scores. Multivariate analysis identified WTAP and Lp-PLA2 as independent CAD predictors. Combined WTAP/Lp-PLA2 detection demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.9548, sensitivity = 95.26%, specificity = 90.16%). WTAP and Lp-PLA2 synergistically reflect CAD progression, offering dual biomarkers for risk stratification.",
