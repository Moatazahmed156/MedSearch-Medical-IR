    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Aggressive nonmelanomatous skin cancer (NMSC) of the head and neck presents an increasingly common therapeutic challenge for which prospective clinical trials are lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The American College of Radiology Expert Panel on Radiation Oncology - Head and Neck Cancer developed consensus recommendations for guiding management of aggressive NMSC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Multidisciplinary assessment is vital to guiding the ideal use of surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy in this disease.",
