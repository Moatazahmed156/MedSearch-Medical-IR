    "abstract": "Renal injuries are classified as minor, major, and critical/catastrophic for purposes of management. The radionuclide renal scintigram is a safe, simple, and extremely sensitive means of establishing the presence of an injury and monitoring kidney function during conservative management, which is utilized in the vast majority of cases. The information that may be obtained from radionuclide imaging is the state of overall and regional blood transit, overall and regional parenchymal function, and urinary extravasation.",
