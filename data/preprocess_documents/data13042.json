    "abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell technologies have enabled characterization of cellular states across distinct omics layers, yielding complementary insights into the organization of biological systems. To jointly leverage these disparate modalities, computational methods have been developed to align non-overlapping cell populations profiled in different omics layers, a task known as diagonal integration, thereby facilitating more fine-grained biological interpretations. However, existing integration approaches unrealistically assume that all cells are alignable and treat prior-knowledge-derived feature correspondences as fully reliable, retaining them unrefined throughout the alignment process. In this work, we introduce ",
