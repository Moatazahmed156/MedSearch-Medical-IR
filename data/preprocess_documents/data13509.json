    "abstract": "Postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype in Parkinson's disease (PD) portends poorer prognosis and limited treatment response. While cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is implicated in motor impairment, its specific association with PIGD remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the correlation between the severity of CSVD and PIGD subtype in PD patients. This cross-sectional study enrolled 161 PD patients (mean age 71.14 ± 7.04 years). Motor subtyping [postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD)/tremor-dominant (TD)/intermediate type (IT)] used MDS-UPDRS-derived ratios. CSVD burden was quantified via two validated MRI-based scores: the total CSVD burden score (range 0-4) and modified CSVD burden score (range 0-6). Multivariate logistic regression analysis, which adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, and vascular risk factors, was used to explore the correlation between CSVD burden and PIGD. The prevalence of PIGD was 49.07% ( Global CSVD burden was independently associated with the occurrence of PIGD in PD. CSVD assessment may help identify PD patients at the highest risk for axial motor disability, highlighting the convergence of vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies.",
