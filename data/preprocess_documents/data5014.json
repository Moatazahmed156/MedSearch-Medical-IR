    "abstract": "Prostate Cancer is the forth most common type of cancer. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is anchored in the cell membrane of prostate epithelial cells. PSMA is highly expressed on prostate epithelial cells and strongly up-regulated in prostate cancer. Therefore it is an appropriate target for diagnostic and therapy of prostate cancer and its metastases. This article discusses several articles on radionuclide treatments in prostate cancer and the results on PSMA therapy with either beta or alpha emitters as a salvage therapy.",
