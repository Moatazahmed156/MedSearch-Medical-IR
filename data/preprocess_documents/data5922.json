    "abstract": "Gastric electrical and contractile activities were assessed in healthy adult dogs on the eighth day after circumcostal gastropexy surgery, using serosal electrodes and strain gauge force transducers. Recordings were analysed to determine gastric slow wave frequency, presence of gastric slow wave dysrhythmias, gastric slow wave propagation velocity, coupling of gastric contractions to slow waves, a gastric motility index based on relative contractile amplitudes, and onset of gastric contractions after a standardised meal. Overall, gastric electrical and contractile activities were relatively unaffected by circumcostal gastropexy.",
