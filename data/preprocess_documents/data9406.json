    "abstract": "Growing evidence highlights the links between diabetic neuropathy (DNP), gut dysbiosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in colon and bone microstructure deterioration. Geranylgeraniol (GG) shows neuroprotective and osteoprotective capacity. Our study examines GG's effects on pain-associated behaviors, glucose homeostasis, gut microbiota, mitochondrial homeostasis, and bone microstructure in DNP rats. We randomly assigned 27 male Sprague Dawley rats to three groups (",
