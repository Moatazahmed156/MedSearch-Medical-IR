    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major global health challenge driven by renal fibrosis, lacks effective antifibrotic therapies. Fedratinib, a JAK2 inhibitor for myelofibrosis, shows kinase-modulating potential but uncharacterized utility and safety in CKD. Computational toxicity prediction utilized ProTox3.0 and ADMETlab2.0. Fedratinib-CKD targets were identified ",
