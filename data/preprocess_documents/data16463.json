    "abstract": "Since October 2024, 55 human cases of influenza A(H5N1), clade 2.3.4.4b, were reported in the US. Sequencing of 46 viruses identified genotypes B3.13, D1.1, and D1.3. Virus genomes were analyzed for mutations associated with reduced antiviral susceptibility. Except for two, viruses from human cases were assessed as susceptible to antivirals and confirmed by ",
