    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease involving a combination of factors, such as genetic susceptibility, immunologic dysregulation and exposure to environmental triggers. Animal models serve an important function both in elucidating the pathophysiology and preliminary screening of antidiabetic molecules. Hence, the development of models for type 1 diabetes can be broadly divided into 3 categories, namely: identification of spontaneously developing type 1 diabetes mellitus strains, creating diabetes-prone species through gene transfer techniques and forced destruction of islet cells through chemical or surgical means. This review discusses the models used to study type 1 diabetes with special emphasis on genetics.",
