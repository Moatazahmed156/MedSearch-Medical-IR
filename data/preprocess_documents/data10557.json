    "abstract": "Allergic asthma is characterized by dysregulated type 2 immunity to environmental antigens. However, our knowledge is limited regarding how type 2 immune responses are regulated during chronic airway inflammation. CD4 This study aimed to identify the population of Treg cells that play a key role in regulating allergen-induced type 2 immune responses. Naïve mice were intranasally (i.n.) exposed to fungus Alternaria alternata extract or house dust mite for up to 6 weeks. We characterized the phenotypes, tissue localization, and temporal dynamics of Treg cell subpopulations. In vivo functions were assessed using mice deficient in Treg cells or Ccr8, as well as wild-type mice treated with anti-IL-10R blocking antibody. Depletion of Treg cells or blockade of the IL-10 pathway exacerbated type 2 airway inflammation in mice exposed to Alternaria. Multiple Treg cell subsets were identified in the lungs after Alternaria exposure. Among them, CCR8 Tissue-resident CCR8",
