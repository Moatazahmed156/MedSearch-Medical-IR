    "title": "Recent progress of remission in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that was previously considered a lifelong disease and requires long-term reliance on hypoglycemic medications. However, recent studies have shown that certain patients may achieve remission through various intervention strategies, which may alter the ultimate therapeutic targets for clinicians. This review aims to summarize and update the latest clinical evidence and research advancements regarding remission strategies for T2DM, primarily including intensive lifestyle interventions, metabolic surgery, short-term intensive insulin therapy, and non-insulin hypoglycemic drugs (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dorzagliatin) treatments, to guide the selection of appropriate treatment modalities for diverse patient populations. Additionally, the durability of sustained diabetes remission is briefly discussed.",
