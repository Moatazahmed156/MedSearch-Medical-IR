    "title": "Metabolite-centric perspectives on QT prolongation: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications beyond the parent drug.",
    "abstract": "Prolongation of the heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is a widely accepted surrogate for delayed ventricular repolarisation and torsade de pointes (TdP) risk. Although initial drug-safety efforts targeted parent compounds, accumulating evidence shows that circulating and tissue-accumulated metabolites are often the primary drivers of QTc change. This review synthesizes mechanistic, translational, and clinical findings to explain how metabolites prolong QT through several routes: direct hERG and other ion-channel inhibition, modulation of sodium and potassium currents, interference with channel trafficking, and transcriptional remodelling. Case studies across antimalarials, psychotropics, tuberculosis regimens, opioids, and oncology agents consistently demonstrate stronger exposure-response relations for metabolites than for their parent drugs. Advances in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, active-moiety concentration-QT assessment, and time-varying QT correction now allow more precise risk quantification and dose individualisation. In parallel, genetic variability in enzymes such as CYP2B6 and CYP2D6, transporter polymorphisms in ABCB1, and drug-specific myocardial distribution patterns help explain inter-individual susceptibility. Clinically, metabolite-aware drug selection within a class, dosing, scheduled electrocardiographic monitoring, and judicious management of drug interactions can mitigate arrhythmic risk without sacrificing therapeutic benefit. Future progress will depend on the routine incorporation of metabolite profiling and pharmacogenetic data into both drug development and patient care to advance precision cardiology.",
