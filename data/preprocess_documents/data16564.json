    "title": "[Cerebral malaria after travel to Indonesia].",
    "abstract": "A young Danish boy developed severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria after travel to Indonesia without malaria chemoprophylaxis or mosquito protection. Flu-like symptoms were misinterpreted as influenza, delaying diagnosis. He presented cerebral malaria and multiorgan failure requiring intensive care. Rapid treatment with IV artesunate led to full recovery. The case highlights the importance of correct travel advice, as well as early recognition of malaria symptoms and rapid malaria testing without delay after travel in a malaria endemic area, despite a low perceived local risk of malaria.",
