    "abstract": "The relationship between male prostate diseases and the hypoxic microenvironment has drawn increasing attention from the medical world. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a typical factor for the hypoxic microenvironment, in prostate diseases is one of the hotspots in recent studies. HIF-1 plays an important role in different prostate diseases by participating in metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, immune regulation and other life activities. This review focuses on the action mechanisms of HIF-1 in prostatitis, prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.",
