    "title": "Long-Term Impact of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines on the Burden of Pneumococcal Meningitis in Mozambique, 2013-2023.",
    "abstract": "Mozambique introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in 2013 using a three-dose primary series with no booster dose (3p+0) and later switched to the PCV13 using a schedule of two primary doses with one booster (2p+1). We aimed to describe the burden and serotype distribution of pneumococcal meningitis in children under 5 years of age in Mozambique over an eleven-year period starting with the year of PCV10 introduction, and assess the impact of the PCV vaccine and schedule changes. We analysed meningitis surveillance data in Mozambique from March 2013 through to December 2023. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eligible children in three referral hospitals (Maputo Central Hospital [south], Beira Central Hospital [central], and Nampula Central Hospital [north]). Culture and polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR) were performed on each sample.  Of the 4075 CSF samples tested, 7.4% (301/4075) were positive for  Since the introduction of PCVs in Mozambique, the burden of pneumococcal meningitis and deaths in children under 5 years of age has substantially decreased, as well as the prevalence of PCV13-serotypes. Higher valency PCVs are needed due to the increased prevalence of non-PCV10/13-serotypes.
