    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Endometrial cancer is one of the few cancers that has continued to rise in incidence over the past decade, necessitating novel diagnostic and treatment approaches.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      A revised staging system for endometrial cancer has been implemented in the last 5 years as growing attention has also been directed toward identifying biomarkers and other factors that offer deeper insights into tumor biology and therapeutic responses. Fertility-preserving therapy can be an option for younger patients when certain criteria are met. The use of immunotherapy for advanced stages (III or IV) or recurrent endometrial cancer has been studied extensively over the last 5 years, with new treatment options including checkpoint inhibitors. Recurrent cases have a particularly poor prognosis, and there have been limited options for patients. New treatments have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for recurrent endometrial cancer, leading to improved outcomes for patients.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      There have been improvements in endometrial cancer therapy, leading to increased survival and improved outcomes; however, there are unmet needs that need to be addressed in 2026 and beyond.",
