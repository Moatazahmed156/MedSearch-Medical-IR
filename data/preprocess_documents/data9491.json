    "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the relationship between the monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) and visceral fat area (VFA) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 2156 patients with T2DM who received medical treatment at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital participated in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups based on VFA: the increased VFA group (VFA ≥ 100 cm MHR level was significantly higher in the increased VFA group ( MHR levels are associated with visceral fat area in patients with T2DM, which has a modest predictive value, and it may be useful in detecting visceral obesity.",
