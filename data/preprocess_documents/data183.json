    "abstract": "Sleep is essential for health, potentially influencing awake and sleep bruxism, which may lead to outcomes that can persist from childhood through adult life. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the association between sleep quality and awake or sleep bruxism in children and adolescents. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were searched until June 2025 to assess the association between bruxism and sleep quality or duration. Only observational studies were analyzed. Biases were assessed by the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cross-sectional and case-control studies, respectively. Fourteen studies were included. Meta-analyses showed no differences between sleep bruxism and control individuals regarding polysomnography parameters and subjective sleep duration. Individuals with caregivers' reports of poor sleep quality showed a higher odds ratio (OR) for presenting sleep bruxism (OR = 1.92; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-2.48; I2 = 32 %). The single study on awake bruxism showed an association with self-reported poor sleep quality in adolescents. The certainty of evidence was rated as low for objective parameters and very low for subjective parameters. Objective sleep quality was not associated with sleep bruxism, while poor sleep quality reported by caregivers was. The perception of sleep quality in children and adolescents stood out as a relevant factor for assessing bruxism. Further evidence is needed for awake bruxism.",
