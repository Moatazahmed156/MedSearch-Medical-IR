This case report describes a case of accelerating growth of a vulvar mass, initially diagnosed as Bartholin cyst. Surgical excision led to a histopathologic diagnosis of vulvar leiomyoma. The postoperative recovery was complicated by secondary hematoma and dehiscence of the surgical site. There was no recurrence at 2 years follow-up.",
