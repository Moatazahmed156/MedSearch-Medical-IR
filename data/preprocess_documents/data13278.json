Pharmacological research has highlighted that Sal exhibits pronounced neuroprotection against oxidative stress-triggered damage. An in vivo mice model of Parkinson's disease (PD) was developed using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and in vitro studies employed 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP",
