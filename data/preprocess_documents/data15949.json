    "abstract": "Amino acid biosynthesis pathways are essential for cell growth as they supply the fundamental building blocks for protein synthesis. Such pathways in pathogenic cells can serve as an excellent target in the development of antimicrobial drugs. Our study examined key enzymes of the bacterial transulfuration pathway, cystathionine γ-synthase (kCGS) and cystathionine β-lyase (kCBL) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, an opportunistic microorganism belonging to the group of ESKAPE pathogens that causes nosocomial infections and causes significant clinical problems for its high frequency and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes. The recombinant enzymes were expressed in E. coli, purified and characterized. The kCGS catalyzes the γ-replacement reaction at the first stage of the transsulfuration pathway, the succinyl group of O-succinyl-L-homoserine (OSH) being replaced by the thiol of L-cysteine to form L-cystathionine with the efficiency k",
