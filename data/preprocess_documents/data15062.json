    "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the excessive accumulation of fat in the liver. It is classified into four categories based on clinical manifestations: Metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD), metabolic-alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), ALD, and cryptogenic SLD. In the United States, its prevalence stands at 34.2%, making it the most common cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to factors related to endocrine, nutrition, and medications, several genetic markers have been implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Notable genes include ",
