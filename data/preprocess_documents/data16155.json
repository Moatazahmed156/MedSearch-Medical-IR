    "title": "Teach-back techniques in telehealth: A review and insights for future directions.",
    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in patient-provider communication due to the absence of in-person interactions and visual cues. Teach-back, a method where patients repeat information to confirm understanding, is a promising tool for improving communication in virtual care. This review evaluates the effectiveness of teach-back techniques in telehealth settings. A search of four databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed) was conducted, yielding 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The article inclusion/exclusion criteria consisted of the following: (1) telehealth services topic; (2) direction provision related to teach-back; and (3) English, peer-reviewed, empirical journal publication. Risk of bias in included studies was assessed using established tools for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), and qualitative studies. Data synthesis followed the PICO framework, and thematic analysis was used to compare outcomes across studies. Included studies which varied in design, modality, and telehealth specialty. Teach-back was consistently associated with improved patient knowledge, confidence, and self-management, as well as clinical outcomes such as better glycemic control and medication adherence. Overall evidence quality was moderate, with common limitations including small sample sizes and brief follow-up periods. Teach-back is effective in enhancing patient understanding and outcomes in telehealth settings. However, variability in study design and implementation highlights the need for standardized protocols and additional research. Provider training in effective virtual teach-back strategies may enhance patient comprehension, strengthen communication, and advance health equity in telehealth delivery.",
