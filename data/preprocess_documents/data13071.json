    "abstract": "The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an aging population poses significant societal and healthcare challenges, leading to growing interest in strategies for early diagnosis and disease modification. This review synthesizes key developments in the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of AD for general hospital clinicians. Diagnostic advances include improving the detection of hallmark biomarkers-amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)-via neuroimaging modalities, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and increasingly accessible plasma-based assays. Disease-modifying therapies which target amyloid, including Lecanemab and Donanemab, offer promising avenues but require close clinical monitoring due to associated risks such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). While the amyloid and tau hypotheses continue to underpin much of the pathophysiological understanding of AD, current models also recognise the role of additional mechanisms such as chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, broadening the scope for therapeutic targets. Collectively, these diagnostic and therapeutic advances represent a significant shift in AD early identification and management, with implications for the individual patient and the healthcare system.",
