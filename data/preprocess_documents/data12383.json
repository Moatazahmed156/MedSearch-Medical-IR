Through a rational screening, three ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) variants (mutant RBD1, mutant RBD2, and mutant RBD3) were identified to introduce the genetic linker DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine) to bio-orthogonally load BTZ through a catechol-boronate ester with enhanced receptor binding.
