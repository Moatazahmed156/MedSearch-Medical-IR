    "abstract": "Although multiple trauma remains the leading cause of death among children, fewer resources and less attention have been directed to treatment of the injured child than to treatment of the injured adult. Insufficient training of medical personnel and hence lack of expertise in the management of injured children are factors contributing to disability and death in such children. Although the principles of resuscitation of injured children are similar to those for adults, appreciation of the differences in cardiorespiratory variables, airway anatomy, response to blood loss, thermoregulation and equipment required is essential for successful initial resuscitation. Cerebral, abdominal and thoracic injuries account for most of the disability and death among injured children. Cerebral damage may be due to secondary injuries to the brain and is potentially preventable. The need to preserve the spleen in children complicates the management of abdominal trauma. Although children usually have large cardiorespiratory reserves, they are likely to need airway control and ventilation with thoracic injuries. The psychologic effect of trauma may pose long-term problems and needs close follow-up.",
