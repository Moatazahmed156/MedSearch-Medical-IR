    "abstract": "Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood, and the gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a key player in its pathogenesis through the gut-lung axis. This pilot, cross-sectional study analyzed the intestinal microbiota of 20 children (6-9 years) with intermittent or mild persistent asthma, in the absence of a healthy control group. Stool samples were processed with 16S rRNA sequencing (Illumina iSeq100, V3-V6 regions) and analyzed with MicrobAT-SmartSeq software. Contrary to most literature, no enrichment of ",
