    "title": "Trends and Outcomes in the Use of Adjunctive Fractional Flow Reserve From a Large Multicentre PCI Registry.",
    "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) to accurately identify which coronary artery lesions are appropriate for intervention. We aim to describe the use of FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a large Australian PCI registry. We assessed data from consecutive patients in the Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry from 2014 to 2020 who presented with stable coronary artery disease or non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and underwent FFR-guided PCI in a single procedure. They were compared with a cohort who underwent standard angiographically guided PCI over the same period. A total of 59,401 patients were included in the study with 2,455 (4.1%) undergoing FFR-guided PCI. Patients who underwent FFR-guided PCI less often presented with a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (22% vs 39%, p<0.001), were less probable to have their procedure out of hours (4.8% vs 10.6%, p<0.001), and more probable to have radial access (70% vs 59%, p<0.001). The use of FFR increased over the study period (2.8% of all cases in 2014 vs 4.7% in 2020, p<0.001). FFR-guided PCI was more often performed on the left anterior descending artery (65% of all cases vs 42%, p<0.001). The 30-day mortality was less in the FFR-guided group (0.2% vs 0.6%, p=0.005) but the overall mortality was very low. This observational study demonstrates that the frequency of use of FFR to guide PCI was low in the Australian context; however, use is increasing. Patients in the FFR-guided group had lower 30-day mortality, although the overall rates of mortality in the study were very low.",
