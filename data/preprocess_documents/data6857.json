    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, predominantly impacting men. The highest risk for the development of a TBI includes athletes, construction workers, military personnel, and law enforcement. TBI is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The degree of TBI will determine the severity of clinical manifestations. Management of TBI may be a combination of operative and non-operative interventions. Nursing considerations and management include frequent assessment of vital signs and neurologic status, maintaining hemodynamic stability, early identification of worsening clinical manifestations, and psychosocial support to the TBI patient and family.",
