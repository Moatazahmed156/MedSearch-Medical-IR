    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological mechanism in the development of numerous cardiovascular disorders. To improve therapy and preventive strategies, clinicians need a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of congenital heart diseases (CHD). The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether oxidative stress is elevated in patients with CHD compared to healthy controls, and to evaluate whether a difference in oxidative stress parameters can be observed between patients with cyanotic (cCHD) and acyanotic CHD (aCHD). Therefore, 21 studies investigating oxidative stress in peripheral blood of both children and adults with CHD were reviewed. Different methods to assess the oxidant status were compared and divided into three categories: pro-oxidative or anti-oxidative stress markers and the ratio of pro-to-anti oxidative stress markers. This meta-analysis showed elevated oxidative stress levels in patients with CHD, and more specifically in patients with cCHD. Moreover, this indicates that there could be potential in oxidative stress measurements as a new biomarker of disease severity. Further research will be needed to clarify the exact role of oxidative stress and its contributors in CHD in order to get a better and more in-depth understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of CHD, especially the higher susceptibility of the right ventricle (RV) to progress to heart failure (HF). This could facilitate the development of antioxidant treatments and RV-specific HF therapies, which are necessary to improve survival in these patients and could be of particular importance in cCHD.",
