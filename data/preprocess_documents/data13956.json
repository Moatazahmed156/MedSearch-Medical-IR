    "title": "Microsponge Drug Delivery Systems: Advancing the Therapeutic Efficacy of Anti-Inflammatory Medications.",
    "abstract": "Microsponge drug delivery systems represent an innovative approach to enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs through controlled release, improved bioavailability, and targeted delivery. These porous polymeric microspheres, ranging from 5 to 300 μm, encapsulate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to achieve sustained drug release, minimizing systemic side effects and dosing frequency. Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis, often require prolonged treatment, but conventional therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids are limited by systemic toxicity and frequent administration. Microsponges address these challenges by enhancing drug stability, increasing retention at the target site, and reducing systemic exposure. Advanced fabrication techniques, including emulsion solvent diffusion, liquid-liquid suspension polymerization, and electrohydrodynamic atomization, allow precise control over microsponge properties, optimizing drug loading and release kinetics. In arthritis, microsponges extend anti-inflammatory activity; in IBD, they enable colon-specific delivery; and in psoriasis, they enhance drug penetration through keratinized plaques. These systems improve patient compliance by reducing dosing frequency and minimizing adverse effects. Despite their promise, further research is needed to optimize formulations, evaluate long-term safety, and fully explore their potential in managing chronic inflammatory diseases. Microsponge technology offers a transformative platform for improving therapeutic outcomes, paving the way for innovative treatments in pharmaceutical and clinical applications.",
