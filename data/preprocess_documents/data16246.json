    "title": "Inactivation of Influenza A Viruses (H1N1, H5N1) During Grana-Type Raw Milk Cheesemaking: Implications for Foodborne Transmission Risk.",
    "abstract": "The detection of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in lactating dairy cattle in the United States, with high viral titers in raw milk, has raised concerns about zoonotic transmission through unpasteurized milk and dairy products. While viral inactivation during pasteurization is documented, data on persistence in raw-milk cheeses remain limited. This study evaluated the survival of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), both low pathogenic (LPAIV, H1N1) and highly pathogenic (HPAIV, H5N1), during the production and ripening of Grana-type hard cheeses from raw cow's milk. Experimental cheesemaking was carried out with milk artificially contaminated with A/duck/Italy/281904-2/06 (H1N1; 10",
