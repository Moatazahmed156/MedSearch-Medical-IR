    "title": "Enhancing pneumococcal vaccine efficacy in pediatric patients with asthma: Investigating immune response modulation.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric patients with asthma are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, yet optimal vaccination strategies for this population remain unclear. Although pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for high-risk groups, the effectiveness of immunization in children with asthma, particularly regarding booster doses, is not well understood. This study assessed serologic response and clinical outcomes following pneumococcal booster vaccination in pediatric patients with asthma. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 64 patients with asthma aged 2-17 years who received at least one pneumococcal booster. Data on demographics, asthma severity, steroid use, and vaccine titers were collected. Immune protection was defined by serotype-specific titer thresholds. Changes in asthma classification and systemic steroid use pre- and post-vaccination were analyzed using chi-squared tests. At 4-8 weeks post-vaccination, 96.9% of patients demonstrated protective antibody titers. However, 71.4% of those retested more than 6 months later lost protective titers, suggesting waning immunity. Statistically significant reductions in asthma severity ( Pneumococcal booster vaccination elicited a strong initial immune response and was associated with improved asthma outcomes. However, waning immunity highlights the need for further research into optimal vaccine scheduling, booster timing, and the influence of immune-modulating therapies in this high-risk pediatric population.",
