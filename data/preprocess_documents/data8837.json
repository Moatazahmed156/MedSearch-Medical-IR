    "abstract": "In this chapter, I discuss how quality improvement activities can be facilitated using routinely available clinical data. I begin by providing a definition of quality improvement and quality healthcare, and identifying what I consider key components and their information requirements. I suggest that quality improvement can be made simpler, more efficient and less labour and resource intensive by focussing on outcomes. Finally, I provide pointers for developing resources of routinely available clinical information.",
