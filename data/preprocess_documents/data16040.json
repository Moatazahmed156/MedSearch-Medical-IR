    "title": "Diagnostic Methods for Bovine Coronavirus: A Review of Recent Advancements and Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Bovine coronavirus(BCoV) is a significant pathogen causing substantial economic losses in the cattle industry through increased calf mortality, reduced growth performance, and decreased milk yield. Rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are therefore essential for controlling BCoV transmission. Current diagnostic methods comprise two primary categories: conventional techniques and cutting-edge innovations. Conventional approaches, including molecular methods like RT-PCR/qRT-PCR and immunological assays such as ELISA and neutralization tests, remain the main diagnostic methods. However, they are limited by laboratory dependency as well as the necessary balance between speed and sensitivity. These limitations have promoted the development of innovative methods, including isothermal amplification, CRISPR/Cas systems, droplet digital PCR, and integrated platforms. This review comprehensively analyzes the advantages, limitations, and applications of current diagnostic methods, highlighting integrated platforms such as RPA-CRISPR-LFA and microfluidics-based LFA. These innovations bridge critical performance gaps by enhancing sensitivity and specificity while enabling field application, demonstrating significant potential as next-generation point-of-care diagnostics for managing this economically critical pathogen.",
