    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Up to half of postmenopausal women experience genitourinary symptoms secondary to hormone deficiency, and there is little consensus on the use of vaginal hormone therapy (VHT) for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in these patients. This is a review of the scientific literature in the last decade evaluating the use of VHT for disorders of the lower urinary tract including overactive bladder (OAB), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (ICS/BPS).\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Vaginal estrogen therapy improves OAB symptoms in postmenopausal women, but results are mixed when VHT is used in combination with other treatments. There is inconclusive or limited data for the use of VHT to treat SUI and IC/BPS. Vaginal estrogen and prasterone (DHEA) therapies have demonstrated efficacy as treatment modalities for patients who experience recurrent UTIs. VHT preparations show efficacy for the treatment of certain LUTS and can be considered in carefully selected patients when clinically indicated.",
