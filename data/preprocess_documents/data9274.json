    "abstract": "Objective: Late gadolinium enhancement(LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(CMR) was used to evaluate the myocardial viability of chronic total occlusion(CTO) in patients with coronary heart disease and to observe the relationship between collateral circulation and myocardium viability in these patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 40 patients with CTO diagnosed by invasive coronary angiography (CAG) from September 2015 to June 2016 in our department, all patients performed CMR examination within one week after CAG.The collateral circulation of CTO was graded with Rentrop classification as follows: poor or no collateral circulation group, moderate collateral circulation group and good collateral circulation group.According to CMR images, the delayed enhancement transmural extent of myocardial segments were scored, the ventricular wall motion of the myocardial segment were graded, and the wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated.Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the delayed enhancement transmural extent of myocardial segments and WMSI. Results: In the no or poor collateral group of 6 myocardial regions, 1 myocardial region had viable myocardium and 3 myocardial regions had no viable myocardium; in the moderate collateral group of 16 myocardial regions, 11 myocardial regions had viable myocardium and 5 myocardial regions had no viable myocardium; in the good collateral group of 24 myocardial regions, 21 myocardial regions had viable myocardium and 3 myocardial regions had no viable myocardium, there was significant difference between the groups (P=0.002). The WMSI of poor or no collateral circulation group, moderate collateral circulation group and good collateral circulation group were 1.54±0.50, 1.21±0.34 and 1.26±0.40, respectively, there was no significant difference between the groups (P=0.063). Spearman correlation analysis showed that the extent of delayed enhancement transmural extent of myocardial segment was significantly associated with WMSI (r=0.638, P<0.01). Conclusion: Collateral circulation in patients with chronic total occlusion can predict myocardial viability.Increase of Rentrop grade is linked with higher possibility of the presence of viable myocardium.",
