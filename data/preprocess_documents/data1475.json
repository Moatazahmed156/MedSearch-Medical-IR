    "abstract": "Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective C-H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth-abundant and cost-efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90 % yield and up to 99 % ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.",
