    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a progressive clinical condition characterised by an abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which are predominantly generated by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and other fibrogenic cells. This process leads to liver stiffness, which can progress to cirrhosis, an irreversible condition, and ultimately result in liver failure. Obtusifolin (OBT), an anthraquinone derivative isolated from the seeds of Senna obtusifolia, is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study evaluated the anti-fibrotic efficacy of OBT using in vitro models, including TGFβ-induced differentiation in HUCLS, HSC-LX2, and HHSECs, and an in vivo CCl",
