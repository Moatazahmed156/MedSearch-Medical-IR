    "title": "Cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric evaluations of daily living self-efficacy scale in Turkish population.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the Turkish version of the Daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale for cultural adaptation, validity, and reliability. One hundred and four people with stroke (male 60; female 44) were included in the study. The Turkish Daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale was evaluated for data quality, scaling assumptions, acceptability, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and divergent validity. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Independence Measure, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Frenchay Activities Index tests were administered for divergent validity. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Pearson's correlation coefficients. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation process followed Beaton's guidelines. The response rate was 100% for both test and retest, with no missing data. Following the cross-cultural adaptation, minor modifications were made to enhance cultural relevance. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for internal consistency of the Daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale was 0.979, and the intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.990. This indicated high reliability. According to the results of various validity analyses, the Daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale showed a strong correlation with the Functional Independence Measure, Mini-Mental State Examination, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Frenchay Activities Index ( This study provides preliminary evidence of the validity and reliability of the Turkish Daily Living Self-Efficacy Scale.",
