    "abstract": "Wild birds are key natural reservoirs and play a central role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). However, the absence of a standardized global list of wild bird hosts has limited comprehensive AIV risk monitoring and assessment within the One Health framework. Here, we generate a taxonomically harmonized dataset of AIV wild bird hosts, derived from 23,358 viral isolates of wild bird origin reported in the GISAID EpiFlu",
