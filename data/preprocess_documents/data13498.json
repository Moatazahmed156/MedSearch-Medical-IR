    "abstract": "Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired alpha (α)-synuclein (α-syn) protein function. α-syn can aggregate within oligodendrocytes, activating oxidative stress pathways and ultimately leading to cell death. Point mutations in the α-syn gene (SNCA) are associated with MSA-A53E and G51D, but cases are mainly idiopathic. Methylene Blue (MB) is an organic dye that has been demonstrated to attenuate oxidative stress in cell models of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. We hypothesized that MB would protect α-syn stably transfected oligodendroglial cell models of MSA against hydrogen peroxide (H",
