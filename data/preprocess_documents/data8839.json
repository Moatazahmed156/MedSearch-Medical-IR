    "abstract": "Critical appraisal of the literature is the third step in the evidence-based practice process. There are 2 types of Level VI evidence, such as single qualitative studies and quality improvement (QI) projects. The process for critical appraisal of a single qualitative study is the same as that for an appraisal of a systematic review or metasynthesis of qualitative studies, as described in a previous evidence-based practice column. This column will describe the critical appraisal of QI projects.",
