    "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) is rare and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. We quantified the frequency, characteristics, outcomes, and risks associated with CNS TB. We performed a retrospective analysis of culture-confirmed TB in adults reported to the California TB Registry during 2010-2022 to compare individuals with CNS TB vs. non-CNS TB. We used a causal diagram and modified Poisson model with robust variance to estimate the adjusted relative risk of CNS TB vs. non-CNS TB among people with TB caused by  There were 21,117 TB cases reported; 382 (1.8 %) involved the CNS. Compared to those without CNS TB, those with CNS TB were more likely younger, of Hispanic ethnicity, born in Mexico, infected with  More than one quarter of patients with CNS TB died.
