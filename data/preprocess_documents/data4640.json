    "abstract": "Lung diseases remain one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Cell therapy and regenerative medicine have the potential to revolutionize the management of life-threatening and debilitating lung diseases that currently lack effective treatments. Over the past decade, the repair capabilities of stem/progenitor cells have been harnessed to prevent/rescue lung damage in experimental neonatal lung diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells and amnion epithelial cells exert pleiotropic effects and represent ideal therapeutic cells for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a multifactorial disease. Endothelial progenitor cells are optimally suited to promote lung vascular growth and attenuate pulmonary hypertension in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or a vascular bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are one of the most exciting breakthroughs of the past decade. Patient-specific iPSCs can be derived from somatic cells and differentiated into any cell type. iPSCs can be capitalized upon to develop personalized regenerative cell products for surfactant protein deficiencies-lethal lung disorders without treatment-that affect a single gene in a single cell type and thus lend themselves to phenotype-specific cell replacement. While the clinical translation has begun, more needs to be learned about the biology of these repair cells to make this translation successful.",
