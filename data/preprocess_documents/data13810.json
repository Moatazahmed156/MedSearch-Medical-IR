    "abstract": "To evaluate the association of systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) with Behçet disease uveitis (BU), and to assess their predictive value for inflammatory activity and clinical prognosis in BU patients. There were 194 patients diagnosed with Behçet disease (BD) and 122 healthy controls. The BD patients were classified into two subgroups based on disease activity: An active phase cohort ( SII and SIRI levels were significantly elevated in BD patients with ocular and vascular manifestations compared to those with stable disease ( SII and SIRI may serve as potential clinical indicators for predicting inflammatory activity and prognosis in BD patients with uveitis. SII, in particular, demonstrates superior predictive performance for BU onset and disease activity, providing a basis for early identification of high-risk patients and clinical decision-making. 探讨全身免疫炎症指数(systemic immune inflammation index，SII)和全身炎症反应指数(systemic inflammatory response index，SIRI)与白塞病葡萄膜炎(Behçet disease uveitis, BU)的相关性，及其在BU患者疾病活动度及临床预后评估中的预测价值。 回顾性纳入194例白塞病(Behçet disease, BD)患者和122例健康志愿者，按BD疾病活动与否分为疾病活动期(90例)和疾病稳定期(104例)，按是否发生葡萄膜炎分为BU组(49例)与非BU组(145例)，BU组按葡萄膜炎是否活动分为炎症活动期BU组(26例)与炎症稳定期BU组(23例)。基于常规血液检验指标(血小板、中性粒细胞、淋巴细胞、单核细胞计数)计算SII和SIRI。采用Spearman相关性分析评估SII和SIRI与BU发病风险、疾病活动及炎症标志物的相关性；通过受试者工作特征(receiver operating characteristic, ROC)曲线分析确定SII和SIRI预测BU发病风险及疾病活动的最佳阈值与预测效能。 BD疾病活动期的SII和SIRI水平均高于BD疾病稳定期( SII和SIRI可作为BD合并BU患者风险预测、疾病活动度及预后评估的潜在临床指标，为临床早期识别高风险BU患者及干预决策提供了依据。",
