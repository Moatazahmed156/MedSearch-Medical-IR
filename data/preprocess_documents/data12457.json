    "title": "The treatment of acute tendon injury with small extracellular vesicles originating from TNFAIP6",
    "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles originating from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSC-sEVs) have excellent therapeutic value in acute tendon injury. However, their mechanism and effects have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to identify the key subsets and mechanisms of action of ADSC-sEVs involved in the repair of complete tendon tear caused by acute injury. Based on our previous research demonstrating that ADSC-sEVs improve the quality of acute tendon injury repair, the present study utilized second-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to predict the key role of the TNFAIP6 TNFAIP6 Our findings enhance the current understanding of how TNFAIP6",
