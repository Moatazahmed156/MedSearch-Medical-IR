    "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder and body satisfaction among patients at Ruhigita clinic, Bukavu (DRC): an observational study.",
    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, armed conflicts have intensified globally, with Africa disproportionately affected. Since January 2025, renewed violence by the March 23 Movement (M23) in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has generated widespread trauma, displacement, and psychological distress. Beyond emotional suffering, trauma has been linked to altered body perception and reduced body satisfaction, particularly among women survivors of violence, adding further complexity to the psychological burden. This study assessed the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among hospital patients in Bukavu and examined associations with body-related symptoms and body satisfaction. It was hypothesized that many patients would meet PTSD criteria, that affected individuals would report lower body satisfaction and greater body-related distress, and that only a small minority would have accessed psychological care. Data were collected at Ruhigita Clinic, South Kivu. Adults aged 18-65 completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5, French version) and the Bruchon-Schweitzer Body Satisfaction Questionnaire. A PTSD score ≥32 indicated clinical symptoms; adequate body satisfaction was defined as ≥3. Interviews lasted 45-60 min and included demographic and trauma-related data. A total of 356 patients participated. The mean PTSD score ( This study confirms a strong link between PTSD, body dissatisfaction, and somatic symptoms in a conflict-affected population. Despite high awareness of distress, mental health service use remains low. Findings highlight the need for integrative, culturally sensitive interventions that respect local understandings of trauma and healing while addressing urgent gaps in psychological care.",
