Two patients being treated at our hospital for nonspecific abdominal symptoms had abnormal findings from a small-bowel series; at surgery, an ulcerating process involving the jejunum was found. Clinical, radiological, and pathological findings in these cases suggest that ICUE is a distinct entity.",
