    "abstract": "Vitamin D (VitD) has been implicated in neuroprotection, yet its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between VitD status, supplementation, and vitamin D receptor ( Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar through August 2025 for observational studies, clinical trials, and genetic association studies. Primary outcomes included serum VitD levels in PD versus healthy controls (HCs), prevalence of VitD insufficiency/deficiency, and effects of VitD supplementation on motor symptoms. Secondary outcomes assessed associations between  Sixty-three studies ( VitD deficiency is common in PD and may influence disease risk and motor function. Current evidence indicates limited benefit of supplementation for motor outcomes, and genetic associations remain inconsistent.",
