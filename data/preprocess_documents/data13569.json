    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's (PwP) and their caregivers have to manage multiple daily healthcare tasks (treatment burden). This can be challenging and may lead to poor health outcomes. To assess the extent of treatment burden in Parkinson's disease(PD), identify key modifiable factors, and develop recommendations to improve treatment burden. A mixed-methods study was conducted consisting of: 1) a UK-wide cross-sectional survey for PwP and caregivers using the Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire (MTBQ) to measure treatment burden levels and associated factors and 2) focus groups with key stakeholders to discuss survey findings and develop recommendations. 160 PwP (mean age = 68 years) and 30 caregivers (mean age = 69 years) completed the surveys. High treatment burden was reported by 21% (N = 34) of PwP and 50% (N = 15) of caregivers using the MTBQ. Amongst PwP, higher treatment burden was significantly associated with advancing PD severity, frailty, a higher number of non-motor symptoms, and more frequent medication timings (>3 times/day). Caregivers reporting higher treatment burden were more likely to care for someone with memory issues, had lower mental well-being scores and higher caregiver burden. Three online focus groups involved 11 participants (3 PwP, 1 caregiver and 7 healthcare professionals) recruited from the South of England. Recommendations to reduce treatment burden that were discussed in the focus groups include improving communication. clear expectation setting, and better signposting from healthcare professionals, increasing education and awareness of PD complexity, flexibility of appointment structures, increasing access to healthcare professionals, and embracing the supportive role of technology. Treatment burden is common amongst PwP and caregivers and could be identified in clinical practice using the MTBQ. There is a need for change at individual provider and system levels to recognise and minimise treatment burden to improve health outcomes in PD.",
