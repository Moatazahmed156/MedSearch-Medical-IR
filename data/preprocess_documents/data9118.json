    "abstract": "As organisms age, somatic stem cells progressively lose their ability to sustain tissue homeostasis and support regeneration. Although stem cells are relatively shielded from some cellular aging mechanisms compared with their differentiated progeny, they remain vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. In this review, we delineate five cardinal features that characterize aged stem cells and examine how these alterations underlie functional decline across well-studied stem cell compartments. These hallmarks not only provide insight into the aging process but also serve as promising targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at rejuvenating stem cell function and extending tissue health span.",
