    "title": "Stem cell therapy: a novel frontier in the treatment of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.",
    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver, and they represent significant global health concerns due to their increasing prevalence worldwide. Traditional therapeutic approaches, such as liver transplantation, are limited by donor availability and potential complications. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for liver regeneration and repair. This paper reviews the latest advancements in stem cell therapy for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, drawing from recent clinical trials and laboratory studies. We explore various stem cell types, evaluating their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action in liver repair. Our findings suggest that stem cell therapy, with its anti-fibrotic properties, immunomodulatory effects, and ability to promote hepatocyte regeneration, holds significant promise for the future of liver disease treatment.",
