    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease involving memory impairment, confusion, and behavioural changes. The disease is characterised by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, which disrupt normal neuronal function. There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease and due to increasing life expectancy, occurrence is projected to rise over the coming decades. The causes of Alzheimer's disease are multifactorial with inflammation, oxidative stress, genetic and epigenetic variation, and cerebrovascular abnormalities among the strongest contributors. We review the current literature surrounding inflammation and epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on how oxidants from infiltrating immune cells have the potential to alter DNA methylation profiles in the ageing brain.",
