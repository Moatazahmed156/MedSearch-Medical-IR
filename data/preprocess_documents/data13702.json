    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent synovial inflammation and progressive joint destruction. Its pathogenesis involves aberrant activation and aggressive proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), excessive macrophage infiltration, and disrupted M1/M2 macrophage polarization within the synovial microenvironment (SME). However, current therapies remain inadequate for precise SME modulation, often leading to limited efficacy and poor prognosis. To address this challenge, we developed a multifunctional nanocapsule, termed RP/HP@Mn/L, which is composed of a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-modified, Mn",
