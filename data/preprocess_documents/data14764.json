    "title": "Chronic kidney disease and survival following indirect mitral annuloplasty for functional mitral regurgitation.",
    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is associated with poor prognosis following mitral valve edge-to-edge repair. We aimed to investigate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on survival in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) undergoing indirect mitral annuloplasty using the Carillon Mitral Contour System. In a retrospective analysis, a total of 100 consecutive FMR patients were assigned according to baseline renal function into three groups: estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 30 patients revealed a baseline eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m CKD in patients undergoing indirect mitral annuloplasty seems to be a negative predictor of outcome in FMR patients. However, Carillon device implantation improved NYHA and FMR classification regardless of renal function.",
