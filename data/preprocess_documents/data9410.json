    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a leading cause of morbidity worldwide along with the risk of other chronic health issues. Hyperglycemia has been shown to alter immune regulation at the wound site and potentially contributes to non-healing DFUs. However, the effects of hyperglycemia on the expression of mediators of inflammation and angiogenesis (CD36), immune regulation (TLR-7 and CD69), and inflammation/tissue repair (CD274) regarding wound healing are unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects of hyperglycemia on the gene and protein expression of CD36, CD69, CD274, and TLR-7 during wound healing using a rat model of induced diabetes. The expression of these mediators was examined using cutaneous tissues from rat models of diabetes with cutaneous wounds. Skin samples ",
