    "abstract": "Heart failure is one of the leading healthcare problems in the world. Clinical data lacks sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of heart failure. Laboratory biomarkers are a non-invasive method of assessing suspected decompensated heart failure. Biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides have shown promising results in the management of heart failure. The literature does not provide comprehensive guidance in the utilization of biomarkers in the setting of acute heart failure syndrome. Many conditions that manifest with similar pathophysiology as acute heart failure syndrome may demonstrate positive biomarkers. The following is a review of biomarkers in heart failure, enlightening their role in diagnosis, prognosis and management of heart failure.",
