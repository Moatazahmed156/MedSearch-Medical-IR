    "title": "Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific burden of alcohol-related diseases, 1990-2021: a comprehensive analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
    "abstract": "The burden of alcohol-related disease is substantial and varies across regions, age and sexes. The study used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data to estimate the burden, emphasizing on changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study analyzed trends in prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs of alcohol-related diseases [alcohol use disorder (AUD), cirrhosis due to alcohol, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and liver cancer due to alcohol use] across sex, age groups (adolescents, young adults, women of childbearing age, the working-age population, the elderly), and socio-demographic index (SDI) levels using annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC). Globally, prevalence of AUD increased by 31.44%, while the ASPR declined by 0.78% annually. China, India, United States of America bearded the higher burden. The prevalence of cirrhosis due to alcohol increased by 73.69%, alcoholic cardiomyopathy by 48.24%, and liver cancer due to alcohol use prevalence also increased. Working-age populations had the largest absolute numbers of cirrhosis due to alcohol and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, while the elderly had higher ASR of liver cancer due to alcohol use. Following 2019, improvements in most alcohol-related diseases decelerated, particularly in working-age population, potentially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study emphasizes the urgent need for targeted policies on alcohol-related diseases, especially for vulnerable groups, considering regional, socio-economic, and for timely interventions to reduce the long-term health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
