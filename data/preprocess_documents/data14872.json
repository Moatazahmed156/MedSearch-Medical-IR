    "abstract": "The underlying metabolic mechanisms between healthy lifestyle behaviors and a lower risk of chronic liver diseases (CLD) remain elusive. This prospective cohort study of 168,260 UK Biobank participants without baseline liver disease identified a healthy lifestyle-associated metabolic signature using elastic net regression and examined its relationship with CLD. The resulting signature, comprising 66 metabolites, was strongly correlated with healthy lifestyle scores (",
