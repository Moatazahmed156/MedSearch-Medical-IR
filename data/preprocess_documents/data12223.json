    "abstract": "Menthol evokes cooling sensations by activating the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel, resulting in relaxing, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects when administered through inhalation and topical application. Although the toxicity of menthol is relatively low, the mechanism underlying menthol-induced cytotoxic effects remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of menthol in the A549 lung cancer cell line. Menthol induced increases in intracellular Ca",
