    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative disorder of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), with aging as a major risk factor. Although circadian clocks are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and metabolic balance, the influence of aging on tissue-specific circadian regulation of TMJ homeostasis remains unclear. Here, using aged mice and transgenic mouse models, we demonstrated that the mesenchymal circadian clock is indispensable for preserving TMJ osteochondral integrity during aging.
