    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a common and severe hepatic disorder characterized by the excessive accumulation of Collagen I. Lumican, an extracellular matrix protein, plays a critical role in collagen fibril assembly and contributes to progression. However, macrocyclic peptide-based inhibitors of this interaction remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report the discovery and structure-activity relationship of novel macrocyclic peptides that act as potent and stable inhibitors of the Lumican-Collagen I interaction. Among these, peptide ",
