    "abstract": "Patients with moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at high risk for developing intracerebral complications and in particular neuroworsening (NW). NW can be unpredictable and may be an important risk factor for poor neurologic outcome and for increased mortality. NW is often a medical and surgical emergency, and it is, therefore, fundamental to identify patients at risk early because they require strict neuromonitoring and repeated neuroimaging. So far, there is no standardized and validated definition of NW. In this review, we aim to discuss the definition, risk factors, and management of patients with moderate TBI at high risk of NW.",
