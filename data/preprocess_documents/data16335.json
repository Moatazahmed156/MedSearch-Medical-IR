    "abstract": "Post-strabismus surgery endophthalmitis (PSSE) is a rare but significant complication, which is most commonly associated with medial rectus recession. We report a case of PSSE in a child who had completed chemotherapy 1 year prior to surgery. Despite vaccination, Haemophilus influenzae was cultured from the vitreous. Although infrequent, scleral perforation during surgery can occur without immediate detection. PSSE is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, common pathogens found in the respiratory tract of children.",
