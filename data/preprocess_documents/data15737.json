    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant  CRE cases reported to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency in 2024, were analyzed, focusing on demographic characteristics, types of healthcare facilities, and pathogen profiles. A total of 42,347 CRE cases were reported from 1,610 healthcare facilities, including 33,169 CP-CRE cases from 1,313 facilities. The proportion of CP-CRE among CRE cases increased from 61.9% in 2020 to 78.3% in 2024. General hospitals accounted for 19,006 cases (44.9%), advanced general hospitals for 10,905 (25.8%), and long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for 8,940 (21.1%). The reports from LTCHs increased from 8.2% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2024. Regionally, 26,624 cases (62.9%) were reported in the Capital area. Among reported isolates,  Since the introduction of mandatory surveillance in 2017, the number of CRE cases and reporting healthcare facilities have steadily increased. The upward trend in reports from LTCHs is likely to reflect multiple factors, including population aging as well as patient- and facility-related characteristics. Considering the genotype-specific trends and regional variations, tailored strategies for the early detection of CP-CRE outbreaks are warranted. Sustained collaboration between the public and private sectors is crucial for effective CRE control.",
