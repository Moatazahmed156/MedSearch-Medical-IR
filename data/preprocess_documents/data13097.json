    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging due to the extremely low concentration of relevant biomarkers and the limited sensitivity of conventional detection techniques. In this study, we present a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) immunosensor for label-free detection of phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217). The device employs a Y",
