    "title": "Driving habits and difficulties in people with epilepsy: A survey.",
    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological condition that can interfere with driving abilities through seizures and cognitive impairments. While legal frameworks often regulate driving eligibility, little is known about how people with epilepsy perceive and adapt their driving in everyday life. This study aimed to examine driving habits, self-perceived difficulties, and adaptive behaviors in people with epilepsy compared to a control group. A total of 665 participants (103 individuals with epilepsy and 562 individuals without epilepsy) completed an online questionnaire covering driving habits, avoidance behaviors, and compensatory strategies. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare responses between groups. Contrary to expectations, individuals with epilepsy do not report more driving difficulties than controls. On the other hand, they appear to have more avoidance behavior and compensatory strategies. They were more likely to avoid certain situations (e.g., night driving, long trips) and to implement proactive adjustments (e.g., driving only when feeling well, taking shorter trips). People with epilepsy appear to implement self-regulation strategies that reduce their exposure to difficult driving conditions. These strategies likely help maintain safe driving practices but may also restrict mobility and autonomy. Given that these data are based on self-reports the interpretation of the results must be cautious, particularly since people with epilepsy did not report more difficulties than controls. We propose two interpretations (i.e., adaptive hypothesis and anticipatory hypothesis) that are not mutually exclusive. Future studies should integrate these perspectives with objective assessments to provide more robust evidence for clinical and regulatory recommendations.",
