    "abstract": "NDM-type metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are among the most widespread acquired carbapenemases in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. As with other β-lactamases, allelic variability occurs among NDM-type MBLs, with almost 100 variants so far reported, differing by single or multiple amino acid substitutions or insertions, which may have implications for enzymatic activity. In this study, we report on a novel NDM variant, NDM-63, identified in a carbapenem-resistant ST147 ",
