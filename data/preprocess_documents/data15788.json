    "abstract": "This qualitative study examines the question of how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health experiences of medical students in Hong Kong. Students' poor mental health is a serious public health concern because it impacts the quality of patient care they may eventually provide. It may also impact healthcare organizations through staff retention. Research in Hong Kong on this topic remains scarce, and most studies are quantitative and fail to capture medical students' actual mental health experiences during the pandemic. Understanding their experiences during the pandemic remains relevant given how radically it reshaped healthcare and education. 18 interviews with 'COVID-19 cohorts' of students (2020-2023) were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed qualitatively using the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. Themes related to mental health stressors and coping strategies were identified. The main mental health stressors were physical, socio-relational and educational. The coping strategies focused on support from others and more drastic measures such as leaving medicine altogether. Our findings underscore the importance of consolidated efforts and close collaboration between universities and healthcare organizations (workplaces) to ensure that policies, procedures, and infrastructure are aligned with the goal of supporting students' mental health.",
