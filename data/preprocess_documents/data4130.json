    "abstract": "This case report details anatomical variations in a cadaveric donor during the dissection laboratory. This case shows a possible association between an incomplete double ureter, arching testicular arteries, and an accessory testicular artery. This case describes these variations and briefly discusses ways to classify them. We aim to document these anomalies, discuss possible embryological reasons for their association, and shed light on their clinical significance. This case report contributes to the limited literature and highlights the importance of reporting these anomalies when encountered during autopsies or pedagogical cadaveric dissection.",
