    "abstract": "Kynurenic acid (KYNA) has recognized anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Previous studies demonstrated that KYNA reduces TNF-α, S100A12, S100A8/9, and α-defensin production while increasing tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) levels in rheumatoid arthritis. This study evaluated a synthetic KYNA analog's effects on TNF-α, S100A8/9, S100A12, α-defensin, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) production and TSG-6 expression in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 54 AS and 38 PsA patients and 11 healthy controls were stimulated with heat-inactivated ",
