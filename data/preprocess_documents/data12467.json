    "title": "Effect of Pathological Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Long-term Outcomes in Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer: A Japanese Multicenter Study.",
    "abstract": "Few studies have examined how the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally advanced colorectal cancer affects prognosis. A total of 162 patients who received NAC followed by radical resection with curative intent between April 2016 and December 2024 were included. Patients were classified into two groups: good response (n=43) and poor response (n=119). Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared between the groups. The good response group had a lower rate of combined resection of adjacent organs (11.6%  Patients with a good response to NAC tended to have a better prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy might improve outcomes in patients with poor response to NAC.",
