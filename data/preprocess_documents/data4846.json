    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple method for the in situ determination of Young's moduli of surface-micromachined bilayer thin films. The test structure consists of a cantilever, a bottom drive electrode located near the anchor, and a bottom contact electrode placed below the free end of the cantilever. The cantilever is driven by applying a voltage sweep between the cantilever and the drive electrode, and bends due to the electrostatic force. A novel theoretical model is derived to relate Young's modulus with the applied voltage and structure dimensions. The theoretical model is validated by finite element simulation. Test structures for Au/polysilicon thin films are fabricated by the PolyMUMPsand tested with the current-voltage measurement system. The measured Young modulus of polysilicon ranges from 152.344 GPa to 154.752 GPa, and the measured Young modulus of Au ranges from 71.794 GPa to 74.880 GPa. Compared with existing extraction methods, the proposed method is featured with simple operation, good repeatability, relatively high precision, and low requirements for equipment. It can be used alongside the application of a process control monitor (PCM) in surface-micromachining process lines.",
