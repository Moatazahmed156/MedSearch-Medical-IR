    "abstract": "Heart failure in adolescents can manifest due to a multitude of causes. Presentation is often quite variable ranging from asymptomatic to decompensated heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Because of the diverse nature of this disease, a thoughtful and extensive evaluation is critical to establishing the diagnosis and treatment plan. Identifying and addressing reversible pathologies often leads to functional cardiac recovery. Some disease states are irreversible and progressive, requiring chronic heart failure management and potentially advanced therapies such as transplantation.",
