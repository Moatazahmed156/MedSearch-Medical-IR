    "title": "Genomics in Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance: An Exploratory Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Genomics has revolutionized epidemiology and disease surveillance by providing powerful tools for identifying, tracking, and analyzing pathogens at the molecular level. This exploratory analysis examines the integration of genomic with traditional epidemiological approaches, highlighting the role of whole-genome sequencing as a key method for pathogen identification, outbreak investigation, and understanding transmission dynamics. By enabling the detection of mutations and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance, genomics allows for precise mapping of infection sources and transmission pathways, thereby improving the timeliness and accuracy of public health responses. Furthermore, genomic surveillance supports the early detection of emerging variants, such as those observed during viral outbreaks like COVID-19, facilitating proactive intervention strategies. Despite its transformative potential, challenges related to data privacy, infrastructure, and interdisciplinary collaboration persist. This analysis emphasizes the importance of genomics in building resilient surveillance systems to address future infectious disease threats and advocates for sustained investment in genomic technologies to advance global health security.",
