    "abstract": "Benzimidazole and benzoxazole derivatives are included in the category of medical drugs in a wide range of areas such as anticancer, anticoagulant, antihypertensive, anti- inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antiviral, antioxidant, immunomodulators, proton pump inhibitors, hormone modulators, etc. Many researchers have focused on synthesizing more effective benzimidazole and benzoxazole derivatives for screening various biological activities. In addition, there are benzimidazole and benzoxazole rings as bioisosteres of aromatic rings found in drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the diverse activity of the benzimidazole and benzoxazole rings and bioisosteres marketed as drugs for Alzheimer Diseases, designed compounds containing these rings are likely to be effective against Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the effectiveness of compounds containing benzimidazole and benzoxazole rings against Alzheimer's disease will be examined.",
