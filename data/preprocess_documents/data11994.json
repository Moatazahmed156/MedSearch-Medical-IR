    "title": "Novel Approach of an Automated Radiolabeling of Micro- and Nanoscale UiO-66 MOFs for Internal Radiotherapy of Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Development of automated radiolabeling strategies for perspective materials is in huge demand to reach the large-scale production of radiopharmaceuticals with unique features under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. Inherent properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) such as high loading capacity, chemical stability, and biocompatibility allow to recommend them as promising radionuclide carriers for cancer therapy but this area of research is poorly investigated. Herein, we first engineered an automated procedure for radiolabeling micro- and nanoscale UiO-66-NH",
