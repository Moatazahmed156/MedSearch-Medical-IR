    "title": "Biomimetic Glycosaminoglycan-Enriched Electrospun Polymeric Scaffolds for Enhanced Early Tissue Regeneration.",
    "abstract": "Implantable scaffolds are increasingly recognized as transformative tools in regenerative medicine, offering the potential to prevent or mitigate tissue degeneration. Osteoarthritis is a widespread degenerative joint disease that often progresses from early focal lesions to severe joint damage, creating substantial clinical and socioeconomic burdens. Preventive strategies for early-stage lesions remain limited. This study reports the design and development of a functional polymeric scaffold intended to support early tissue regeneration and potentially prevent lesion progression. The scaffold consists of an electrospun poly (ε-caprolactone) nanofibrous membrane enriched with glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, to mimic essential features of the cartilage extracellular matrix and provide a supportive microenvironment. Complete structural, physicochemical, and mechanical characterization was performed to assess the scaffold architecture, stability, hydration properties, and suitability for tissue environments. In vitro investigations were conducted to evaluate cytocompatibility and the interaction of the scaffold with relevant cell types. The scaffold is designed as a potential future preventive strategy to support cartilage integrity and limit disease progression. This approach represents a promising strategy to preserve joint integrity and function, addressing a critical unmet clinical need and enabling translation toward clinical application.",
