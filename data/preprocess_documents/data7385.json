    "abstract": "Intracellular pH influences proliferation and differentiation in a range of stem-like and progenitor cells, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cancer stem cells. Sodium hydrogen exchanger (NHE1), a glycoprotein that plays a major role in regulating intracellular pH, has a major role in the proliferation and cell differentiation in multiple cell types. We review observations collected on the influence of pH on multiple stem-like cell populations. Altering pH, either intracellular or extracellular, can influence stem cell maintenance, self-renewal, differentiation, and pluripotency. Study of the influence of NHE1 and intracellular pH on epidermal stem cell behavior could lead to the discovery of new targets to use in order to manipulate stem cell divisions. This is highly relevant for skin conditions such as psoriasis, wound healing, and melanoma where stem cell proliferation and migration are key factors.",
