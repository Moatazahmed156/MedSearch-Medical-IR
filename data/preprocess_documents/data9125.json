    "abstract": "This review article examines how stem cell therapies can cure various diseases and injuries while also discussing the difficulties and moral conundrums that come with their application. The article focuses on the revolutionary developments in stem cell research, especially the introduction of gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9, which can potentially improve the safety and effectiveness of stem cell-based treatments. To guarantee the responsible use of stem cells in clinical applications, it is also argued that standardizing clinical procedures and fortifying ethical and regulatory frameworks are essential first steps. The assessment also highlights the substantial obstacles that still need to be addressed, such as the moral dilemmas raised by the use of embryonic stem cells, the dangers of unlicensed stem cell clinics, and the difficulties in obtaining and paying for care for patients. The study emphasizes how critical it is to address these problems to stop exploitation, guarantee patient safety, and increase the accessibility of stem cell therapy. The review also addresses the significance of thorough clinical trials, public education, and policy development to guarantee that stem cell research may fulfill its full potential. The review concludes by describing stem cell research as a promising but complicated topic that necessitates a thorough evaluation of both the hazards and the benefits. To overcome the ethical, legal, and accessibility obstacles and eventually guarantee that stem cell treatments may be safely and fairly included in conventional healthcare, it urges cooperation between the scientific community, legislators, and the general public.",
