    "title": "Elacridar Reverses P-gp-Mediated Drug Resistance in Ovarian Cancer Cells in 2D and 3D Culture Models.",
    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle in the treatment of ovarian cancer. MDR is often mediated by the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). In this study, we evaluated the ability of elacridar, a dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor, to overcome MDR in W1, an ovarian cancer cell line sensitive to Paclitaxel (PAC) and its PAC-resistant variants. Cells were cultured under both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) conditions to account for differences in tumor-like microenvironments. The ",
