    "abstract": "Lung cancer prevalence rate has been rising steadily in recent years, for the prevention and treatment, the detection of tumor marker CYFRA 21-1 DNA demonstrates its significance. In this work, an electrochemical biosensor was constructed for sensitive detection of CYFRA 21-1 DNA based on the novel developed Fe The results showed that the detection range of CYFRA 21-1 DNA was 10 pM-10 μM, the limit of detection (LOD) was 1.5 pM. The biosensor exhibited excellent selectivity, reproducibility, and stability; the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 2.01%. The average recovery rate in the spiked diluted human serum samples was 101.4%, and the RSD was ≤5.2%, indicating that the biosensor possessed promising prospect.",
