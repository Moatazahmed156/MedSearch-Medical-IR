    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer strikes 23,000 American women every year, accounting for 52% of all gynecological cancer deaths. The death of comedienne Gilda Radner from ovarian cancer in 1991 brought the disease to the forefront for the American public. Unfortunately, since that time, there has been an absence of publicity about this dreadful disease. Seventy-five percent of ovarian cancers are not diagnosed until the cancer has advanced to stage III or IV for several reasons. Clinical guidelines for the diagnostic screening of ovarian cancer have not been developed, which markedly hinders the diagnosis of ovarian cancer until it is in later stages. The tumor marker CA-125 is not specific and, therefore, is an inadequate screening tool. This article discusses the epidemiology of ovarian cancer, the components of diagnostic screening, and treatment options. Nursing care of the patient undergoing surgical treatment for ovarian cancer also is discussed.",
