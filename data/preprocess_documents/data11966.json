    "title": "Design and biological evaluation of novel water-soluble complexes based on thiosemicarbazone as prospective anticancer agents.",
    "abstract": "The widespread success of platinum-based drugs in the clinical treatment of different neoplasia has led the inorganic metal complexes to be at the forefront of the fight against cancer. In this context, thiosemicarbazones and their metal derivatives serve as promising starting points for developing anticancer agents. In current study, the new fluorescent thiosemicarbazone ligand L and its complexes with some non-toxic first row transition metals such as Mn(II), Fe(III), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) metal ions were attained as L",
