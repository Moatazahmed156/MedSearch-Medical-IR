    "abstract": "Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and its high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma counterpart differ in their precursor lesions, molecular profile, natural history, and response to therapies. As such, low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma needs to be studied separately from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, despite challenges stemming from its rarity. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and the most common molecular defects and pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of the ovarian epithelium from normal to serous borderline ovarian tumors to low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma will help develop better therapies. By adopting targeted approaches there may be an opportunity to integrate novel therapies without the need for robust numbers in clinical trials. This manuscript will discuss low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and focus on the arising treatments being developed with an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.",
