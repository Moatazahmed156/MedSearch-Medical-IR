    "abstract": "Dermatologists, while becoming increasingly involved in the diagnosis and management of patients with connective tissue diseases, have left rheumatoid arthritis relatively unexplored. An increased awareness of possible pathomechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis may allow for generalizations that lead to increased understanding of other connective tissue disorders. The types of cutaneous disorders that occur in association with rheumatoid arthritis include: vasoreactive dermatoses (e.g., various forms of vasculitis), which may occur secondary to the circulating immune complexes present in rheumatoid arthritis; autoimmune bullous disorders, which may occur in the setting of a suppressor T cell defect in rheumatoid arthritis; and various miscellaneous cutaneous associations. Hopefully, this review will lead to an increased understanding of both rheumatoid arthritis and the wide array of cutaneous associations of rheumatoid arthritis.",
