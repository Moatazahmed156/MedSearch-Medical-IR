    "abstract": "Solvation effects influence reaction equilibria by preferentially stabilizing reactants or products (differential solvation). We propose using simple electrostatic concepts to qualitatively interpret and understand these effects, applying the Born and Kirkwood-Onsager equations. Scenarios include, for charged species, redox potentials, different total absolute charges between reactants and products, and size differences between reactants and products. In addition, for neutral species, they are differences in total dipole moment and size differences. These scenarios are illustrated with several examples from different areas of chemistry.",
