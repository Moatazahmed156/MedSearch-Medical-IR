    "title": "Neuro-interventional Radiology in Paediatric Patients: An Update.",
    "abstract": "Paediatric interventional neuroradiologists play a central role in the multidisciplinary management of cerebrovascular diseases in children. With increasing awareness of endovascular treatment options for paediatric neurovascular diseases and continuous improvement in device technologies, such management is being offered to an increasing cohort of children across the spectrum of diseases and ages. This review article aims to highlight recent advances in neurointerventions in the paediatric population, particularly in the management of arterial ischaemic stroke, brain arteriovenous malformations, vein of Galen malformation, intracranial aneurysms, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and retinoblastoma.",
