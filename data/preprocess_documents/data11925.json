    "title": "HER3 enhances ATF4 induction and survival in breast cancer cells during endoplasmic reticulum stress.",
    "abstract": "Oncogenic signaling and stress response pathways interact to drive tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. However, little is known about such interactions for HER3, a member of the HER/ErbB receptor family that is aberrantly expressed in many tumors, including breast cancer. Here, we show that HER3 cooperates with HER2 to enhance induction of ATF4, a central transcription factor of the integrated stress response and the unfolded protein response, during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ATF4 induction was enhanced by ligand-activated HER3 and conversely reduced by genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of HER2/HER3-mediated signaling in both HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and non-overexpressing MCF7 breast cancer cells. HER3 knockdown in SKBR3 cells also increased cell death during ER stress. Notably, depletion of HER3, likely occurring through ER stress-associated downregulation mechanisms, was accompanied by attenuation of ATF4 induction during sustained stress. These findings suggest that the HER3-ATF4 axis functions as a dynamically regulated mechanism for tuning the cellular stress response.",
