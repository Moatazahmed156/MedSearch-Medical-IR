    "title": "Advancing Real-Time Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Imaging: An Anchor-Free Deep Learning Framework with Adaptive Multi-Scale Perception.",
    "abstract": "Accurate and real-time detection of polyps in colonoscopy is a critical task for the early prevention of colorectal cancer. The primary difficulties include insufficient extraction of multi-scale contextual cues for polyps of different sizes, inefficient fusion of multi-level features, and a reliance on hand-crafted anchor priors that require extensive tuning and compromise generalization performance. Therefore, we introduce a one-stage anchor-free detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy whilst running in real-time on a GTX 1080-Ti GPU workstation. Specifically, to enrich contextual information across a wide spectrum, our Cross-Stage Pyramid Pooling module efficiently aggregates multi-scale contexts through cascaded pooling and cross-stage partial connections. Subsequently, to achieve a robust equilibrium between low-level spatial details and high-level semantics, our Weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network adaptively integrates features across all scales using learnable channel-wise weights. Furthermore, by reconceptualizing detection as a direct point-to-boundary regression task, our anchor-free head obviates the dependency on hand-tuned priors. This regression is supervised by a Scale-invariant Distance with Aspect-ratio IoU loss, substantially improving localization accuracy for polyps of diverse morphologies. Comprehensive experiments on a large dataset comprising 103,469 colonoscopy frames substantiate the superiority of our method, achieving 98.8% mAP@0.5 and 82.5% mAP@0.5:0.95 at 35.8 FPS. Our method outperforms widely used CNN-based models (e.g., EfficientDet, YOLO series) and recent Transformer-based competitors (e.g., Adamixer, HDETR), demonstrating its potential for clinical application.",
