    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains a formidable challenge in oncology due to its late-stage diagnosis and limited treatment options. Recent research has revealed the intricate interplay between glycan diversity and the immune microenvironment within ovarian tumors, shedding new light on potential therapeutic strategies. This review seeks to investigate the complex role of glycans in ovarian cancer and their impact on the immune response. Glycans, complex sugar molecules decorating cell surfaces and secreted proteins, have emerged as key regulators of immune surveillance in ovarian cancer. Aberrant glycosylation patterns can promote immune evasion by shielding tumor cells from immune recognition, enabling disease progression. Conversely, certain glycan structures can modulate the immune response, leading to either antitumor immunity or immune tolerance. Understanding the intricate relationship between glycan diversity and immune interactions in ovarian cancer holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Immunotherapies that target glycan-mediated immune evasion, such as glycan-based vaccines or checkpoint inhibitors, are under investigation. Additionally, glycan profiling may serve as a diagnostic tool for patient stratification and treatment selection. This review underscores the emerging importance of glycan diversity in ovarian cancer, emphasizing the potential for unraveling immune interplay and advancing tailored therapeutic prospects for this devastating disease.",
