    "abstract": "Silk fibroin (SF), a natural bioproduct, has been extensively used in biological and biomedical fields including wound healing due to its robust biocompatibility, less immunogenic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and biodegradable properties. SF in different morphologic forms, such as hydrogels, sponges, films, electrospun nanofiber mats, and hydrocolloid dressings, have been successfully used for therapeutic use as wound dressings to induce the healing process. SF has also been known to promote wound healing by increasing the cell growth, proliferation, and migration of different cells types involved in the different phase of wound healing process. In this review, we summarize the different morphologic forms of SF that have been used in the treatment of various wound healing process. We also discuss the effect of SF on various cells types during the SF-induced healing process. Furthermore, we highlight molecular signaling aspects of the SF-induced healing process.",
