    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key therapeutic targets in oncology, and hydroxamic acid derivatives represent one of the most effective inhibitor classes. To explore the structure-activity relationships of this scaffold, a series of 2-mercaptoquinazoline-based hydroxamic acid derivatives (4a-e, 7a-i, and 10a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for HDAC inhibition and anticancer activity, with SAHA serving as a positive control. The 4a-e series emerged as the most potent HDAC inhibitors, with IC",
