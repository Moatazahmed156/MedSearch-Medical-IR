    "abstract": "Female sex hormones have an influence not only on the reproductive process, but on nearly all organs and functional systems. This explains their broad spectre of side-effects, which by their degree of subjective annoyance may impair the acceptability of hormonal contraception or--through a suggested risk to the patient--even enforce discontinuation of medication.
