However, the accuracy of pixel-wise MBF mapping has not been fully investigated in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of advanced QP-CMR using  Thirty-nine patients (29 men, 68±11 years) with known or suspected coronary artery disease underwent both CMR including stress and rest QP-CMR and  CMR-derived MBF showed a good linear correlation with  Advanced QP-CMR using three different model-based deconvolution techniques demonstrated strong agreement with ",
