Several screening programs have reported that mammography will miss at least 10% of breast cancers, physical examination can independently detect breast cancer, the combination of mammography and physical examination is superior to either modality alone, and biopsy of a palpable dominant mass should not be deferred because the results of the mammogram are normal. Optimal breast cancer screening should include both mammography and physical examination of the breast.",
