    "title": "Regulatory Mechanisms of Lipid Rafts in Remodeling the Tumor Immune Microenvironment of Colorectal Cancer and Targeted Therapeutic Strategies.",
    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC), but its therapeutic effects remain limited in microsatellite stable (MSS) patients, indicating the critical role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in regulating immune responses. Lipid rafts, dynamic membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, have emerged as potential targets for TIME remodeling through their integration of immune signal transduction, enrichment of cell death receptors, and regulation of immune cell functionality. This review outlines the pivotal mediating roles of lipid rafts in cellular survival, death, and tumor progression. Specifically, MSS-type CRC exhibits lipid raft structural remodeling driven by dysregulated lipid metabolism, which fosters multiple immune escape mechanisms through exosome-mediated immunosuppressive signaling, promotion of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) M2 polarization, enhanced infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and functional exhaustion of effector cells, such as CD8",
