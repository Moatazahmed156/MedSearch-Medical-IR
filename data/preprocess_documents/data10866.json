    "title": "Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Childhood Asthma: Mechanistic Insights and Clinical Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting millions globally and remains a major public health challenge. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) possess anti-inflammatory properties and have garnered growing attention for their potential role in asthma prevention and treatment. This narrative review summarizes recent advancements in preclinical and clinical research, mechanistic insights, and translational applications of ω-3 PUFAs for asthma prevention and management, specifically highlighting their potential role in reducing the risk and severity of childhood asthma. Preclinical studies indicate that ω-3 PUFA supplementation reduces airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic inflammation, enhancing bronchial epithelial repair via activation of free fatty acid receptors and production of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators. Moreover, observational studies in various populations suggest that increased dietary intake of ω-3 PUFAs during pregnancy and early life may lower the risk of asthma in offspring. However, findings from randomized controlled trials remain inconsistent, with heterogeneity arising from differences in study populations, dosages, formulations, durations, and outcome measures. This narrative review highlights the need for future research to adopt standardized supplementation protocols, investigate interindividual genetic variability in response to ω-3 PUFAs, compare the efficacy of different ω-3 sources, and improve supplement stability to enhance therapeutic potential and safety. Collectively, despite encouraging preclinical and observational evidence, this narrative review underscores that more rigorous and targeted clinical studies are warranted to clarify the role of ω-3 PUFAs in asthma pathogenesis and management, thereby informing their potential use as nutritional interventions for pediatric asthma.",
