    "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Aβ) is widely recognized as a core pathological hallmark and an upstream factor contributing to cognitive decline. However, not all individuals with Aβ pathology inevitably develop cognitive impairment or progress to AD. To date, the key proteins associated with cognitive progression in Aβ-positive (A +) individuals have not been fully identified. This study aimed to identify such proteins in A + participants, defined by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ",
