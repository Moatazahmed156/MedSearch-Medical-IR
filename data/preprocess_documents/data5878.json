    "abstract": "Disordered gastric motility represents a spectrum of dysfunction ranging from delayed gastric emptying to abnormally rapid gastric transit, commonly referred to as the \"dumping syndrome.\" Both extremes of gastric motility disorders can arise from similar pathologic processes, and produce remarkably identical symptoms. This fact underscores the need to attain a precise diagnosis to ensure the institution of optimal therapy. Disordered gastric motility is primarily managed with dietary modification followed by pharmacotherapy, as traditional surgical interventions tend to be fraught with complications. However, continued improvements in minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic modalities promise novel options for earlier and more effective treatment.",
