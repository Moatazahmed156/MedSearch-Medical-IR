    "abstract": "Ecotin, a metabolite secreted by gut microbiota, improved the survival of virus-infected mice when administered via standalone injection. Vaccination of mice with a formulation of recombinant Ecotin and RBD-Fc antigen elicited an earlier production of IgG antibodies, accompanied by a marked increase in the number of CD3",
