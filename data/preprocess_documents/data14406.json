    "title": "Effect of Ferrostatin-1 on temporomandibular joint synovitis induced by abnormal flow fluid shear stress: An in vitro study.",
    "abstract": "Synovitis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a prevalent degenerative joint disease, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TMJ osteoarthritis. This pathological condition arises from abnormal mechanical loading that induces a chronic low-grade inflammation within the synovial microenvironment through ferroptotic processes. Our research explores the impact of flow fluid-induced shear stress (FFSS) on ferroptosis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and elucidates the relationship between mechanical overload and the development of TMJ synovitis. Experimental findings revealed progressive alterations in cellular morphology accompanied by significant elevations in intracellular ferrous ion (Fe",
