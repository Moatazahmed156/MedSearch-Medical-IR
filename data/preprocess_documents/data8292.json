    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The safety and efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well established. The technology has evolved to include 2 device categories: traditional NPWT (tNPWT) and single-use NPWT (sNPWT). Each mode has unique properties benefitting multiple aspects of wound care.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To assess the proportion of tNPWT-treated wounds that could be amenable to sNPWT, thus determining optimal therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A de-identified dataset of wounds managed with tNPWT in outpatient clinics in the United States from 2006 through 2020 was analyzed to determine the proportion of wounds that could have been managed with sNPWT based on wound area, depth, and exudate volume, as well as sNPWT dressing size. Descriptive statistics were reported.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 5040 wounds were analyzed. Ten wound types were identified, the most prevalent being surgical open wound (n = 2268 [45%]). All 8 commercially available sNPWT device dressing sizes, from 1 manufacturer, were included in the analysis. Overall, 3403 wounds (68%) would have been suitable to receive sNPWT instead of tNPWT at treatment commencement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The utilization of tNPWT is ideally positioned for large, deep, highly exuding wounds. However, by assessing a wound's dimensions and exudate volume and type, a more appropriate NPWT device selection can be made; thus, ensuring the delivery of therapy with the most suitable device modality appropriate for the wound and patient while also maximizing resources.",
