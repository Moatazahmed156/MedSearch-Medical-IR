    "title": "Scoping review: Facilitators, barriers, and cultural adaptations in the caregiver skills training program for children with developmental concerns.",
    "abstract": "Autism interventions are predominantly developed in high-income countries, limiting access for families in low- and middle-income countries due to systemic, cultural, and logistical barriers. The Caregiver Skills Training program aims to address this disparity by equipping caregivers with practical skills. This scoping review examines the cultural adaptations, facilitators, and barriers to the implementation of Caregiver Skills Training, focusing on its accessibility, feasibility, and acceptability. A comprehensive search of ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified eligible studies that reported cultural or linguistic adaptations of Caregiver Skills Training. Forward searches and manual reference checks supplemented the review. Data were extracted using the Cultural Adaptation Checklist framework and analyzed for patterns in adaptation, training, barriers, and facilitators. Seventeen studies across Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America highlighted diverse adaptations in language, content, and delivery methods. Facilitators included community partnerships and task-shifting with non-specialists, while barriers involved logistical challenges, stigma, and resource constraints. Caregiver Skills Training's flexible, culturally responsive framework makes it a viable model for scaling autism interventions globally. Tailored adaptations and strong support systems for facilitators are essential to overcoming systemic challenges and ensuring equitable access in low- and middle-income countries.Lay abstract",
