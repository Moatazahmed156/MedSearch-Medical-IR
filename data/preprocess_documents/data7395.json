    "abstract": "Totipotent stem cells are cells with the capacity to form an entire embryo. Many attempts have been made to convert other types of cells to totipotent stem cells which we called induced totipotent stem cells. Various aspects of these cells such as transcriptional and epigenetics networks are unique. By taking advantage of these aspects, efficient methods have been provided to induce totipotent stem cells. Although this advancement is significant, many aspects of induction such as the underlying mechanism remain to be elucidated. On the other hand, embryonic stem cells usually are the source of induction which raise important questions regarding if these methods are induction or promotion of 2C intrinsic totipotent cells in ESC culture. Here, we review the latest mouse progress in underling mechanism of induction of totipotent stem cells. In addition, we follow up on the progress of Blastoids derived from totipotent stem cells.",
