    "abstract": "The type 2 immune response is critical for host defense against large parasites such as helminths. On the other hand, dysregulation of the type 2 immune response may cause immunopathological conditions, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis, and anaphylaxis. Thus, a balanced type 2 immune response must be achieved to mount effective protection against invading pathogens while avoiding immunopathology. The classical model of type 2 immunity mainly involves the differentiation of type 2 T helper (Th2) cells and the production of distinct type 2 cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were recently recognized as another important source of type 2 cytokines. Although eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils can also express type 2 cytokines and participate in type 2 immune responses to various degrees, the production of type 2 cytokines by the lymphoid lineages, Th2 cells, and ILC2s in particular is the central event during the type 2 immune response. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how ILC2s and Th2 cells orchestrate type 2 immune responses through direct and indirect interactions.",
