    "title": "Linking thyroid dysfunction with chronic kidney disease among Indian patients.",
    "abstract": "The implications of chronic kidney disease are extensive and affect the pituitary-thyroid axis and peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones causing significant thyroid dysfunction. The present cross-sectional study includes 90 chronic kidney disease diagnosed patients. We investigated for blood parameters like urea, creatinine and thyroid biomarkers. The overall prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in the study group was 65.56%, 59 out of 90 subjects were observed to have derangements in thyroid biomarkers. The Pearson's correlation reveled there was a significant negative correlation between the serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels and the estimated glomerular filtration (r=-0.04, P=0.001**). This study emphasizes the thyroid derangements of clinical relevance in chronic kidney disease patients which may be helpful to clinicians for better patient care.",
