    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a significant cause of death in many parts of the world. Although timely intervention is associated with better clinical outcome, early gastric cancer detection is frequently not possible given its asymptomatic nature. As such, sensitive and specific gastric cancer biomarkers are highly sought after as diagnostic surrogates that may replace invasive endoscopic and histological examinations. Unlike gastric cancer tissue and serum which are heterogeneous and overloaded with abundant proteins, the gastric fluid contains a concentrated molecular biopsy of the stomach that accurately reflects gastric oncology. This review attempts to (i) summarise the state of proteomics-based gastric cancer biomarker discovery from patient gastric fluids, (ii) outline key considerations in working with the body fluid, and (ii) discuss how the challenges in gastric cancer diagnosis may be overcome with new perspectives in gastric cancer screening.",
