    "abstract": "Drug trial design is at an inflection point in epilepsy and neurological disorders. We are moving from conventional parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to other designs, such as n-of-1 trials. Historically, inclusion criteria for antiseizure medicine (ASM) RCTs have stipulated a minimum number of seizures in the baseline period to judge ASM efficacy. For Dravet syndrome, RCTs have demanded 4 or more seizures/month in the baseline period. However, only 25% of children have sufficiently frequent seizures to qualify for RCTs. Trial outcomes should be tailored to the disease and long-term issues for patients, a much broader remit than seizure frequency alone. ANN NEUROL 2025.",
