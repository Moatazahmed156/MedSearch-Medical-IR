    "abstract": "Women with ovarian cancer often present at advanced stage of disease. The outcome depends mainly on the stage of disease at first diagnosis, but also on the quality of treatment. For individualised tumour treatment, detailed assessment of tumour extension using modern imaging is crucial. Ultrasound remains the initial and most important imaging method for ovarian cancer detection. Although increasing evidence shows that ultrasound is an accurate technique to stage and follow up ovarian cancer, it requires an experienced examiner capable of examining both the pelvis and the abdomen. Computed tomography is the most commonly used imaging modality for preoperative staging and follow up. Magnetic resonance imaging remains a second-line imaging method for solving problems, mainly in the pelvis. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is the optimal imaging technique for suspected recurrence, particularly in women with rising CA 125 levels, but negative results of conventional imaging methods.",
