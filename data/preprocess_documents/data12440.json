    "title": "Periodontal disease and gastric and colorectal cancers: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent chronic oral diseases globally, characterized by chronic inflammatory responses in the gingiva and supporting periodontal tissues. Recent epidemiological and mechanistic studies have indicated that PD not only adversely affects oral health but is also significantly associated with gastric and colorectal cancers. This article reviews the potential link between PD and these gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and potential strategies for preventing and treating gastric and colorectal cancers through the management of PD. Periodontal health management may represent an adjunct avenue for the prevention and control of gastrointestinal cancers; however, high-quality longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to clarify causality.",
