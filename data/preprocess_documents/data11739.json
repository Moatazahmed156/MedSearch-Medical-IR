    "title": "Peripheral Thermoregulatory Modulation for Hot Flash Management: Efficacy of Novel Wrist Cooling Device in Cancer Treatment-Induced and Menopausal Vasomotor Symptoms.",
    "abstract": "Hot flashes/hot flushes/night sweats/vasomotor symptoms significantly affect quality of life in cancer patients undergoing hormone deprivation therapy and postmenopausal women. Pharmaceutical interventions often carry substantial risks. This study evaluated whether a wrist cooling device could serve as a safe, nonpharmaceutical intervention for reducing hot flash severity. We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial in 27 participants (10 breast cancer, 12 prostate cancer, 5 postmenopausal women) experiencing at least 2 moderate-to-severe daily hot flashes. Participants were randomized to receive either the active KÜLKUF wrist cooling device (cooling to 47 °F) or an identical sham device (fan only). After 2 weeks of baseline recording, participants used their assigned device for 2 weeks, then crossed over to the alternative device for 2 additional weeks. Hot flash frequency and severity were recorded in standardized diaries throughout all phases. Compared to baseline, the active cooling intervention reduced severe hot flash episodes by 46% (95% CI: 18% to 74%,  These preliminary findings suggest that targeted wrist cooling may offer a safe approach for managing vasomotor symptoms. Larger studies are needed to confirm efficacy and support clinical implementation.",
