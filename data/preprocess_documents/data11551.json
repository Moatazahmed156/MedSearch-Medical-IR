    "title": "Discovery of a glycosylated colchicine derivative as a neuroprotective agent for ischemic stroke.",
    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke, a leading cause of mortality, arises from blocked brain blood flow that rapidly injures neurons, and repeated failures of neuroprotective molecule trials highlight the complexity of developing effective therapies. Colchicine is a well-known anti-inflammatory agent that modulates microtubule dynamics and suppresses inflammatory cascades in ischemic stroke, but its clinical use is limited by toxicity and narrow therapeutic windows. To meet these challenges, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of glyco-conjugated 4H-benzo[3,4]cyclohepta[1,2-b]furan-4-one derivative (116B), structurally inspired by colchicine while introducing new structural moieties optimized via pharmacophore-based modelling aimed at improving safety and enhancing neuroprotective activity. An efficient convergent synthesis featuring intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation and glycosylation as a key step was rigorously optimized, offering 116B in high yield. In the current study, 116B mitigated H",
