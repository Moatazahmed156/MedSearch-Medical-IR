    "abstract": "The risk of breast cancer in human subjects is associated with the exposure to organochlorines, although the findings have somewhat been inconclusive. A meta-analysis of published peer-reviewed articles was conducted to draw a definitive conclusion about exposure to organochlorine compounds and the incidence of breast cancer, taking into account hospital and population-based case-control studies. Scopus, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were examined to gather retrospective case-control studies, wherein 16 case-control studies meeting the criteria were included, involving 2960 cases and 2777 controls.
