    "abstract": "Jaradat et al. (2025) first describe the goalie phenomenon in youth sports in which children with undiagnosed asthma gravitate toward less physically demanding positions, such as goalkeepers, to avoid exercise-induced respiratory symptoms like breathlessness, wheezing, or coughing. This compensatory behavior may inadvertently mask underlying health conditions, underscoring the importance of clinical vigilance and early diagnostic assessment in pediatric athletes.",
