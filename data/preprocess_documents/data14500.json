    "title": "Rising Global Temperatures and Kidney Health: A Comprehensive Review of Current Evidence.",
    "abstract": "Climate change significantly impacts natural environments, economies, and human health, with rising global temperatures causing increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Studies have shown that heat exposure accelerates kidney function decline and increases hospitalizations for renal diseases. Heat contributes to kidney disease through mechanisms such as dehydration, ischemic injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress, leading to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, increased risk of kidney stone formation, and proteinuria. In light of the anticipated rise in temperatures in the forthcoming years, it is of crucial importance to know the possible consequences for kidney health. This review highlights the relationship between these phenomena, the potential complications that may arise, and the mechanisms of their occurrence. The identification of these mechanisms will further support the development of future targeted preventive strategies and interventions.",
