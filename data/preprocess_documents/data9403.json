    "abstract": "Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) can be related to various factors, including neonatal and perinatal conditions. This study investigated the impact of neonatal and perinatal factors-Apgar score, birth weight, feeding type, sex, and delivery type-on the risk of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and evaluated predictive models. A cohort of 327 patients was analyzed using correlations, General Linear Model, and artificial neural network. T1D patients showed higher birth weight, lower Apgar score, a predominance of formula feeding, and more cesarean deliveries. Diabetes risk showed a moderate positive correlation with birth weight class and nutrition type (",
