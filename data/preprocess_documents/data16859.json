    "abstract": "Progressive neurodegeneration with the movement disorder can be challenging to diagnose. In this article, we present a 12-year-old female child with stroke and progressive neurocognitive decline that was followed by choreo-athetoid movements and worsening dystonia and epilepsy. There was diffuse cortical involvement with predominant frontal-parietal lobes involved, affecting speech and bladder bowel control. Despite no significant family history, the genetic evaluation helped us to diagnose the rare condition. We also discuss the various challenges faced while managing and diagnosing the patient and the role of surgical intervention for the management of difficult to control dystonias in such patients.",
