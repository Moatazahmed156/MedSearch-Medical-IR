    "abstract": "In the therapy for early gastric cancer, Endoscopic diagnosis is essential. When early gastric cancer is diagnosed within certain range, it is possible to be cured without surgery only endoscopic therapy. Indication for now endoscopic therapy is limited lesion which is well differentiated adenocarcinoma not more than 2 cm in size with mucosal infiltration but no ulceration. In the endoscopic therapy, it is important to detect serial multiple occurrence of early gastric cancer and recurrence of residual cancerous lesion. For these problems, annual endoscopic examination is needed.",
