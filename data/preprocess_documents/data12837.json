As longevity increases, the incidence, healthcare costs, and caregiver burden associated with NDs are escalating at an alarming rate. As of recent data, NDs such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only significant health burdens but also reflect a complex interplay between socio-economic factors and healthcare systems worldwide.
