    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising non-invasive modality for clinical cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is constrained by the limited penetration depth of excitation light for most photosensitizers and therapy-induced hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these limitations, we rationally designed a composite upconversion nanoparticle, UCNPs@MSN-Ce6/TPZ (UMCT), integrating the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and the hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) for synergistic PDT and chemotherapy. Utilizing the unique properties of upconversion nanoparticles, UMCT generates singlet oxygen (",
