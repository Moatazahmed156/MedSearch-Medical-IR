    "abstract": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) with increased morbidity and mortality. The diagnostic values of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 125, and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in these patients was unclear. A cross-sectional study enrolled patients with RA and healthy control individuals from January 2020 to August 2024. Demographics, disease duration, high-resolution computed tomography scan images, and laboratory test results were collected and analyzed. The cohort comprised 87 patients with RA (40 with and 47 without ILD) and 82 healthy individuals. Serum CEA, CA125, and HE4 levels were clinically significantly higher in patients with RA than in healthy control individuals; they were also elevated in patients with RA and ILD compared with patients with RA but not ILD. Increased levels of CEA, CA125, and HE4 were associated with more severe impairments in pulmonary function. Each biomarker demonstrated satisfactory performance, with the combination of all 3 yielding the highest efficacy (sensitivity = 95.00%, specificity = 95.74%, area under the curve = 0.993) for evaluating ILD. Serum CEA, CA125, and HE4 levels were clinically significantly elevated in patients with RA, particularly in those patients with ILD, and higher levels correlated with poorer pulmonary function. Their combination could facilitate accurate assessment of RA-associated ILD.",
