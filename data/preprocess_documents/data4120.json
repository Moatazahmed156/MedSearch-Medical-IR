    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Gender incongruence (GI) is characterized by a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual's experienced gender and assigned sex, which often leads to a desire to \"transition\" and a demand for medical treatments. Dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity disorder (PDID) are poorly known mental disorders whose clinical presentation can be confused with GI.\n    \n\n\n          Aims:\n        \n      \n      To provide a case report of a patient with PDID and GI who required treatment for GI.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A case report and follow-up were described.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The case report describes a person suffering from PDID and GI and asked for hormonal treatment for GI. In view of the complexity of the case, it was decided to start a follow-up to investigate the gender experience of the different personalities. After 4 months of follow-up, the symptomatology changed, and the patient waived treatment for GI and continued psychotherapeutic treatment for PDID.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our case report shows the complexity of providing treatment for patient with PDID and GI.",
