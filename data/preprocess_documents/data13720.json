    "abstract": "Unregulated excessive angiogenesis is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Plant  The plant  The control group exhibited a well-developed vascular network, characterized by dense and prominent branching of blood vessels with increased diameter; a steep Abbott curve, indicating increased complex vasculature and surface roughness; and a broad angular spectrum, revealing high amplitude and uniform orientation of blood vessels. In contrast, the 0.5% and 1% extracts reduced the dense vasculature, complexity, diameter of primary, secondary and tertiary blood vessels, uniform directionality, and amplitude of blood vessels in the angular spectrum. The 1% extract showed fading of tertiary blood vessels. Both extracts showed a gradual decline in the Abbott curve, but 1% extract showed a decrease in the height of blood vessels.  Conclusion: ",
