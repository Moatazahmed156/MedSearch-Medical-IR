    "abstract": "Anti-androgen therapy continues to be a basic pilar of treatment for both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. The advent of new generation of androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA) transformed the care of patients with advanced disease. After such a success, the steps were taken to incorporate a new generation of ARTAs into the treatment landscape of localized prostate cancer. High-risk prostate cancer represents the most aggressive form of localized disease with significant metastatic potential and poor outcome. Here, the impact of novel therapies will likely be profound and transforming. This clinical space has already been a showcase for multidisciplinary treatment where the combination of local therapies with systemic treatment gradually improved patient outcomes and the chances of cure. The most recent step in redefining the treatment of localized disease is the adoption of novel ARTAs moving forward the multidisciplinary platform. In this narrative review, we discuss current clinical evidence supporting the use of novel ARTAs in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer and cover recent developments in biomarker-driven strategies for treatment individualization in this clinical context.",
