    "abstract": "Oxygen is a critical factor that can regulate the wound healing processes such as skin cell proliferation, granulation, re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration. However, hypoxia, a common occurrence in the wound bed, can impede normal healing processes. To enhance wound healing, oxygenation strategies that could effectively increase wound oxygen levels are effective. The present review summarizes wound healing stages and the role of hypoxia in wound healing and overviews current strategies to incorporate various oxygen delivery or generating materials for wound dressing, including catalase, nanoenzyme, hemoglobin, calcium peroxide, or perfluorocarbon-based materials, in addition to photosynthetic bacteria and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mechanism of action, oxygenation efficacy, and potential benefits and drawbacks of these dressings are also discussed. We conclude by highlighting the importance of design optimization in wound dressings to address the clinical needs to improve clinical outcomes.",
