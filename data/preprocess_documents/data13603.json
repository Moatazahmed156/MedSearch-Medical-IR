    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate acoustic and auditory-perceptual voice outcomes of clear speech cueing in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Speakers with PD completed speaking tasks (a spontaneous speech sample and a standard reading passage) in two speaking conditions: typical and clear speech. Acoustic measures of vocal intensity, fundamental frequency (f Intensity significantly increased in the clear speech condition compared with typical speech. When controlling for intensity, f Targeting the articulatory subsystem with clear speech cueing in PD elicits acoustic and auditory-perceptual changes that align with a louder voice, increased intonational variation, and reduced breathiness. Voice changes with clear speech are not fully explained by concomitant increases in intensity.",
