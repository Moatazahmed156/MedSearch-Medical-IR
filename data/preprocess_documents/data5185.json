    "abstract": "Acquired heart disease in children may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Advances continue to be made in understanding Kawasaki disease, acute and chronic rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The role of superantigens, particularly bacterial toxins, in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease continues to be defined. Intravascular ultrasound promises to improve the assessment of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease. Current recommendations for the long-term management of Kawasaki disease are discussed. Significant changes in the epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever and endocarditis are noted. Updates on the role of echocardiography as well as current therapeutic issues in these diseases are addressed. The application of immunologic and molecular biologic techniques have implicated genetic and immune factors in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. The relationship between viral infection and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as the role of autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these disorders, remains controversial.",
