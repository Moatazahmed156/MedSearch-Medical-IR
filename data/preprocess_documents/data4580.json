    "abstract": "Our study reviewed abnormalities in spontaneous, as well as event-related, brain activity in syndromes with a known genetic underpinning that are associated with autistic symptomatology. Based on behavioral and neurophysiological evidence, we tentatively subdivided the syndromes on primarily hyper-sensitive (Fragile X, Angelman) and hypo-sensitive (Phelan-McDermid, Rett, Tuberous Sclerosis, Neurofibromatosis 1), pointing to the way of segregation of heterogeneous idiopathic ASD, that includes both hyper-sensitive and hypo-sensitive individuals. This segmentation links abnormalities in different genes, such as FMR1, UBE3A, GABRB3, GABRA5, GABRG3, SHANK3, MECP2, TSC1, TSC2, and NF1, that are causative to the above-mentioned syndromes and associated with synaptic transmission and cell growth, as well as with translational and transcriptional regulation and with sensory sensitivity. Excitation/inhibition imbalance related to GABAergic signaling, and the interplay of tonic and phasic inhibition in different brain regions might underlie this relationship. However, more research is needed. As most genetic syndromes are very rare, future investigations in this field will benefit from multi-site collaboration with a common protocol for electrophysiological and event-related potential (EEG/ERP) research that should include an investigation into all modalities and stages of sensory processing, as well as potential biomarkers of GABAergic signaling (such as 40-Hz ASSR).",
