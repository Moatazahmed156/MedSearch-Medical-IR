    "title": "Quality by design (QbD) approach to SE-HPLC method development for cetuximab Monoclonal antibodies.",
    "abstract": "A novel, stability-indicating SE-HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantitative assessment of high molecular weight species (HMWP) and monomers in Cetuximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This method accounts for degradation products generated during forced degradation studies, in accordance with ICH guidelines. The HPLC system was employed with a TSKgel G3000SWXL column at 48 °C with detection at 220 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 250 mM NaCl with a flow rate of 0.85 mL/min. The method demonstrated excellent environmental sustainability as it is entirely aqueous-based, requiring no organic solvents. The calibration curve demonstrated excellent linearity between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/mL, with an R",
