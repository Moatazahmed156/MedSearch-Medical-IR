    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is considered the most lethal among all gynecological malignancies due to its early metastatic dissemination, extensive spread, and malignant ascites. The current standard of care for advanced ovarian cancer involves a combination of cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy utilizing platinum-based and taxane-based agents. Although initial treatment yields clinical remission in 70-80% of patients, the majority eventually develop treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. A growing body of evidence indicates the existence of cancer stem cells within diverse solid tumors, including ovarian cancer, which function as a subpopulation to propel tumor growth and disease advancement by means of drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. The presence of ovarian cancer stem cells is widely considered to be a significant contributor to the unfavorable clinical outcomes observed in patients with ovarian cancer, as they play a crucial role in mediating chemotherapy resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Ovarian cancer stem cells possess the capacity to reassemble within the entirety of the tumor following conventional treatment, thereby instigating the recurrence of ovarian cancer and inducing resistance to treatment. Consequently, the creation of therapeutic approaches aimed at eliminating ovarian cancer stem cells holds great potential for the management of ovarian cancer. These cells are regarded as one of the most auspicious targets and mechanisms for the treatment of ovarian cancer. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of ovarian cancer's recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, alongside the development of effective strategies to overcome chemoresistance, metastasis, and recurrence. The implementation of cancer stem cell therapies may potentially augment the tumor cells' sensitivity to existing chemotherapy protocols, thereby mitigating the risks of tumor metastasis and recurrence, and ultimately improving the survival rates of ovarian cancer patients.",
