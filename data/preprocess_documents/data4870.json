    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common malignancy diagnosed in US women. Although most cases present in early stages and respond well to surgical staging with appropriately administered adjuvant radiation, the prognosis for advanced endometrial cancers is comparatively poor. Currently available treatments for advanced and recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer have significant toxicities, and are given to a population that is usually elderly with multiple other medical comorbidities. This article examines the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer as well as its diagnosis and management.",
