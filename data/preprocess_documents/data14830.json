    "abstract": "Accurate and timely identification of enteric pathogens is crucial for guiding treatment in hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea. Conventional stool testing often lacks sensitivity, whereas multiplex PCR diagnostics offer rapid, comprehensive pathogen detection. This retrospective multicenter study included 267 adult inpatients with acute diarrhea from two hospitals. Patients underwent either traditional stool diagnostics (",
