    "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) remains a leading cause of global cancer mortality, driving the need for novel timely detection strategies, i.e., stages I-II detection when tumor curation is efficient. Circulating microRNA (miRNAs), with their unique stability in biofluids, offer a powerful approach for non-invasive detection. This review compiles validated miRNAs implicated in the early stages of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), elucidating their roles in key oncogenic pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ",
