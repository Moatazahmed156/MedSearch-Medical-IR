    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is associated with a high prevalence of cerebrovascular complications, such as ischemic stroke, particularly at young ages. Among various molecules, vitamin D has been implicated in stroke occurrence. By binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin D regulates several mechanisms, potentially influencing pathways involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral vasculopathy. Here, we evaluated the association between ",
