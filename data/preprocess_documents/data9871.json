    "abstract": "While lifestyle modification is recommended as first-line treatment for lowering blood pressure (BP) in individuals with prehypertension and drug-naïve stage 1 hypertension, there is a paucity of randomized controlled data on such subjects. This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 70 participants (N = 35 per group) with prehypertension and drug-naïve stage 1 hypertension, defined as a systolic BP (SBP) of 130-159 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 85-99 mmHg. The diet & exercise (D&E) group received counseling and monitoring on diet (DASH; dietary approaches to stop hypertension) and regular physical exercise for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in systolic and diastolic BP after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the 24-hour BP and its components and inflammatory markers. Compared with the control group, office SBP and DBP were reduced in the D&E group by 15.1 (-8.73 vs. 6.38 mmHg, p = 0.003) and 6.68 (-4.57 vs. 2.11 mmHg, p = 0.003) mmHg, respectively. The 24-hour ambulatory SBP did not change significantly in either group after 12 weeks (-0.72 vs. 1.92 mmHg, p = 0.667). In subgroup analysis, female, older-age participants and participants with higher baseline BP showed higher reductions in office SBP. Positive effects on office BP were noted by dietary and exercise education, especially in female and older-age participants.Trial registration: 15/05/2022, NCT05274971.",
