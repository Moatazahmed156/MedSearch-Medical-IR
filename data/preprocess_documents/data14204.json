    "title": "Bibliometric and LDA analysis of extracellular vesicles in osteoarthritis.",
    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease with complex risk factors, and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The disease has a subtle onset and mild early symptoms, and its progression is irreversible. Current treatments do not offer a complete cure. Therefore, developing new therapies, early prevention strategies, and reliable biomarkers is essential to reduce the disease burden and improve the quality of life for OA patients. Extracellular vesicles, with their natural biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, have shown great potential in drug delivery and acellular therapies. To provide a complete understanding of the current research and future prospects of extracellular vesicles in OA, this study used bibliometric analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods to systematically evaluate international collaborations, research hotspots, and emerging trends in the field. Our aim is to offer a scientific basis and reference for innovative OA treatment strategies and the clinical application of extracellular vesicles.",
