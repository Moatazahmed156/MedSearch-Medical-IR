    "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading and growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and clinically is defined by the presence of typical symptoms and signs due structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. In addition to family history of heart failure, genetic predisposition to cardiomyopathies and exposure to cardiotoxic agents, risk factors for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are the same as for chronic coronary syndrome. Genome editing technologies can provide the tools to correct genetic defects responsible for various diseases, including cardiomyopathies. These technologies aim to reverse specific mutations. The same methods can also be applied to modulate and improve heart function. This chapter will briefly explain the pathophysiological and genetic aspects of heart failure and then discuss the clinical applications of genome editing in patients with heart failure.",
