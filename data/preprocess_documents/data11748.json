    "title": "Healing beyond the body: Gestalt therapy as a catalyst for psychological resilience among breast cancer survivors.",
    "abstract": "Gestalt therapy was assessed for its impact on negative self-perception and eudaimonic well-being among breast cancer patients. A quasi-experimental study involving 60 participants revealed significant improvement in both self-perception and emotional well-being in the experimental group receiving Gestalt therapy, compared to the control group. The therapy's effectiveness was supported by the significant statistical differences in the outcomes (P < 0.05). Thus, Gestalt therapy is a promising non-pharmacological intervention to support psychological resilience and emotional healing in breast cancer patients, fostering self-acceptance and emotional growth.",
