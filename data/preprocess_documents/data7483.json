Assessing a woman's risk of developing breast cancer is becoming increasingly important for establishing individual screening recommendations and preventive strategies. This article reviews the factors influencing mammographic density (MD), the available methods of MD assessment, and its effect on breast cancer. Finally, we discuss the supplemental screening methods for women with dense breast tissue.",
