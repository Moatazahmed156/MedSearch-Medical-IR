    "abstract": "Heart failure is a major health issue that threatens life and health. Previous studies have shown that heart failure is the terminal stage of arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction. The pathological mechanisms through which cardiovascular diseases result in heart failure include myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy, myocardial cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular remodeling and calcium dysregulation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of heart failure remain elusive because of its complexity, hindering the development of intervention approaches for heart failure. The present study reviewed recent research progress on heart failure and provided references and strategies for the prevention and treatment of heart failure.",
