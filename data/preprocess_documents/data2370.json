    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States and Europe, with an increasing incidence rate in high-income countries. MR imaging is recommended for treatment planning because it provides critical information on the extent of myometrial and cervical invasion, extrauterine spread, and lymph node status, all of which are important in the selection of the most appropriate therapy. This article highlights the added value of imaging, focused on MR imaging, in the assessment of endometrial cancer and summarizes the role of MR imaging for endometrial cancer risk stratification and management.",
