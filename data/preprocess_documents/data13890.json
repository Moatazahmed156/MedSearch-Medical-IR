    "abstract": "Peripheral blood serves both as a source of effector immune cells that migrate to exocrine glands and as a reflection of the immunological changes occurring in patients with Sjögren's disease (SjD). These changes may be linked to the clinical state of these patients. We analyzed total cell counts in the peripheral blood, as well as frequencies of individual leukocyte subpopulations, membrane expression levels of CD38 and CD157, and serum concentrations of soluble sCD38 and sCD157 in SjD patients (",
