    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia that most frequently leads to hospital admission. As prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age, its epidemiological relevance will increase due to the well-known changes in life expectancy. In the presence of atrial fibrillation the cardiovascular mortality and the risk for a stroke are considerably elevated. Interventional treatment, such as catheter ablation or special pacemaker algorithms, have been improved extensively in the last years as a therapeutic option. Nevertheless drug therapy is still the first choice of treating atrial fibrillation.",
