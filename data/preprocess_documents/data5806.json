Much data has accumulated with respect to the pathobiology and clinical behavior of these lesions in the general post-transplant population as well as in the pediatric and adult age groups. However, information as to these lesions in the adolescent and young adult populations, which bridge the pediatric and adult groups, is limited. In this review, the focus is on this unique population of PTLD patients and their proliferations.",
