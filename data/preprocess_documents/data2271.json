    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease treatments have been a heavily investigated research area, however, new drugs have failed one after another. Some scientists have begun to reposition drugs, including antimicrobial agents. Here, the treatment effects of nine antimicrobial agents on Alzheimer's disease and their possible therapeutic mechanisms are described to clarify their efficacy. In vivo and in vitro studies are quite encouraging and tend to demonstrate that antimicrobial therapy is effective in Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, unsatisfactory clinical efficacy, side effects, and insufficient knowledge have yet to be overcome. Further laboratory and clinical studies are required to recommend antimicrobial treatment regimens.",
