    "abstract": "Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder characterized by the inability to concentrate urine, which results in hypotonic urine and increased urinary volume. It may occur because of antidiuretic hormone deficiency or resistance to its action in the renal tubules. When there is a deficiency in the synthesis of antidiuretic hormones, diabetes insipidus is called central; when there is resistance to its action in the renal tubules, it is said to be nephrogenic. We report a case of idiopathic partial central diabetes insipidus and highlight the management and treatment of the disease.",
