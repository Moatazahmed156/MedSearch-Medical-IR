    "title": "Effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma in pain management of osteoarthritis with developmental dysplasia of the hip: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficacy of administering platelet-rich plasma (PRP) compared to hyaluronic acid (HA) for pain management hip osteoarthritis (OA) secondary to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). It highlights PRP treatment as a slightly more effective or equivalent treatment for reducing hip pain in such cases. From 2019 to 2021, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 42 patients who consented to participate. They were divided into two groups: one receiving intra-articular PRP injections and the other HA injections. The primary focus of the study was pain relief, measured using the pain-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)-pain scores over a 24-week period. Functionality was assessed as a secondary outcome. The results showed significant pain reduction in both PRP and HA groups compared to their baseline pain levels. Notably, the PRP treatment group exhibited a marginally higher improvement in pain-VAS scores (38.5) than the HA group (18.7; ",
