    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      This umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluates the effectiveness of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) across various populations and settings.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A total of 25 systematic reviews, including 15 meta-analyses, were analyzed. Reviews were included if they used systematic search methods and quality assessments and focused on the effectiveness of SFBT as a therapeutic approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      SFBT demonstrated significant positive outcomes across different issues, settings, and cultural contexts, with no evidence of harm. High confidence in evidence of effectiveness was established for depression, overall mental health, and progress towards individual goals for the adult population. In addition, findings indicated mainly moderate confidence in evidence of SFBT effectiveness for a wide variety of outcomes for all age groups. No difference was found in the confidence in the evidence by world region, though Western and Eastern studies researched some different aspects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      SFBT is an effective therapeutic approach for various psychological, social, school, medical, couple, or self-related issues. Further research with rigorous methodologies and comprehensive reporting is needed to strengthen the confidence in these findings and provide evidence for the brevity of the intervention.",
