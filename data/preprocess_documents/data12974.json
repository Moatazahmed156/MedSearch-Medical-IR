    "title": "Epigenetic Editing in Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Pioneering Next-Gen Therapeutics for Precision Gene Control.",
    "abstract": "Epigenetic editing has emerged as a promising approach in the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, enabling the precise and enduring modification of genes associated with these conditions. Interventions that focus on chromatin, such as programmable systems like CRISPR/dCas9, zinc-finger proteins, and TALEs linked to epigenetic effector domains, enable the modification of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA control at specific loci. This work integrates current progress in understanding the epigenetic landscape of neurological neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the functions of DNA methylation (de novo vs maintenance, active versus passive demethylation), histone remodeling, and context-dependent gene regulation. We emphasize that the dysregulation of these processes is essential to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and major psychiatric disorders. Innovative therapeutic approaches, including KRAB- and TET-based repressors, \"hit-and-run\" epigenome editing, and targeted noncoding RNA regulation, are analyzed alongside translational methodologies that utilize gene therapy vectors, nanoparticle delivery systems, and inducible expression mechanisms. We also examine proof-of-concept studies that demonstrate how to prevent gene expression and alter the transcriptional networks of diseased cells in living organisms. We identify current challenges, including off-target effects, delivery issues, inadequate understanding of long-term stability, and the need for reliable diagnostics, while highlighting the translational promise of combining epigenetic clearance with biogenesis and repair. This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive and critical examination of the molecular principles, therapeutic strategies, and translational obstacles associated with epigenetic editing in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, thereby facilitating the development of next-generation precision therapies.",
