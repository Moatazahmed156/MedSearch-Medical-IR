    "abstract": "Social isolation during adolescence negatively impacts the development of adult social behaviors. However, the exact link between social experiences during adolescence and social behaviors in adulthood is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated how isolation during juvenility affects harm avoidance behavior in a mouse model of juvenile social isolation. We found that mice subjected to social isolation as juveniles display atypical harm avoidance behaviors and that neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex are involved in these abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, we discovered that the chemogenetic activation of anterior cingulate cortex pyramidal neurons can rescue impaired harm-avoidance behaviors in these mice. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the impact of social experiences on behavior and brain function. Understanding how social isolation during crucial developmental periods can lead to alterations in behavior opens up new avenues for exploring therapeutic interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by impaired prosocial behaviors.",
