    "title": "Does clot composition impact the First Pass Effect in Mechanical Thrombectomy - preliminary results of a single-center study study.",
    "abstract": "Mechanical thrombectomy is an established therapeutic method for acute ischemic stroke and first pass effect (FPE) constitutes the ultimate goal of endovascular treatment.  Clots from AIS patients who underwent MT were examined histologically and the area occupied by red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and fibrin was quantified. The clinical outcome of the procedure was evaluated using modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Seventy consecutive patients were included in this prospective study. Demographics, occlusion site, procedural details and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Full recanalization was observed in 54 patients (77.1%) and from this group FPE was achieved in 28 patients. Statistical analysis did not show significant correlation between clot composition and FPE but low RBC clot area was close to significance (P=0.08). Despite the lack of statistically significant correlation between clot composition and first pass effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke, we observed that red blood cell rich clots were associated with increased number of thrombectomy passes which supports the notion that clot histology influences recanalization outcomes and shows the need for further studies on this topic.",
