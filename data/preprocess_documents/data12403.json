    "abstract": "CRISPR-based genome editing and mRNA vaccine technologies have recently converged to offer new opportunities for precise and adaptable cancer immunotherapy. Their combined use may improve tumor antigenicity while enabling rapid induction of tailored immune responses. This review examines how CRISPR-mediated modulation of oncogenic pathways, immune evasion mechanisms, and antigen presentation can enhance the efficacy of mRNA neoantigen vaccines. A structured literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (2013-2025) was conducted to identify preclinical and clinical studies evaluating CRISPR editing, mRNA cancer vaccines, and integrated combination strategies. Evidence from preclinical models demonstrates that CRISPR-driven tumor sensitization such as checkpoint disruption or antigen restoration amplifies T-cell responses elicited by mRNA vaccination. Early-phase clinical trials in melanoma, non - small-cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer indicate that sequential CRISPR editing followed by individualized mRNA vaccination is technically feasible and capable of inducing durable immune activity. Challenges related to delivery systems, safety oversight, and ethical considerations are also evaluated. CRISPR - mRNA integration represents a promising path toward adaptive, evolution-aware oncology. As delivery and regulatory frameworks advance, combined genome editing and programmable RNA immunotherapy is likely to become a key pillar of future personalized cancer treatment.",
