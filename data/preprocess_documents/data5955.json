    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of early revascularization and drugs to regulate the neuroendocrine system, the impact of such measures on alleviating the development of heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) remains limited. Therefore, it is important to discuss the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse HF after MI. This requires a better understanding of the potential mechanisms involved. HF after MI is the result of complex pathophysiological processes, with adverse ventricular remodeling playing a major role. Adverse ventricular remodeling refers to the heart's adaptation in terms of changes in ventricular size, shape, and function under the influence of various regulatory factors, including the mechanical, neurohormonal, and cardiac inflammatory immune environments; ischemia/reperfusion injury; energy metabolism; and genetic correlation factors. Additionally, unique right ventricular dysfunction can occur secondary to ischemic shock in the surviving myocardium. HF after MI may also be influenced by other factors. This review summarizes the main pathophysiological mechanisms of HF after MI and highlights sex-related differences in the prognosis of patients with acute MI. These findings provide new insights for guiding the development of targeted treatments to delay the progression of HF after MI and offering incremental benefits to existing therapies.",
