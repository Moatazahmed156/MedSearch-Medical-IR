    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex biological process involving multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. Ubiquitination, a crucial post-translational modification, plays a vital role in regulating various aspects of wound healing through protein modification and degradation. This review comprehensively examines the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination in wound healing, focusing on its regulation of inflammatory responses, macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, and the activities of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We discuss how ubiquitination modifies key signaling pathways, including TGF-β/Smad3, NF-κB, and HIF-α, which are essential for proper wound healing. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for treating impaired wound healing, particularly in conditions such as diabetes. The review highlights recent advances in understanding ubiquitination's role in wound healing and discusses future research directions for developing targeted therapeutic approaches.",
