    "abstract": "Cancer, at the molecular level, continues to be more thoroughly understood. With this understanding comes the opportunity for innovative therapeutic intervention. Gene therapy remains an attractive concept to treat cancer. However, a number of gene therapy clinical trials have now been reported and it is clear that barriers remain before gene therapy gains widespread clinical application. This article outlines current directions and novel developments in the field of cancer gene therapy, which attempt to overcome these obstacles.",
