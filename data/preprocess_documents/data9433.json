    "title": "Molecular Portrait of Autoantigens in Type 1 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "This review focuses on the molecular pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), specifically on the key autoantigens targeted by the autoimmune response and the clinical implications of their epitope specificity. T1D is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. The autoimmune attack is directed against a defined set of autoantigens, primarily insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, tyrosine phosphatase-like protein, zinc transporter 8, as well as several minor autoantigens. A critical advancement in understanding the disease has been the analysis of epitope specificity, revealing that immunodominant epitopes are conformational and often localized to C-terminal protein regions, exposed during β-cell degradation. The introduction of sensitive multiplex assays for the simultaneous detection of T1D-associated autoantibodies represents a major diagnostic breakthrough. These platforms enable early diagnosis, risk stratification, and the identification of a \"therapeutic window\" for intervention. At this preclinical stage, antigen-specific immunotherapies aimed at restoring immune tolerance show significant promise. Ultimately, the combination of personalized diagnostic profiles, epitope mapping, and targeted therapies forms the basis for a new T1D management paradigm focused on halting the autoimmune process itself and preserving functional β-cell mass.",
