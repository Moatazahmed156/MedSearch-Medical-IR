    "title": "Cross-sectional study on ethnic variations in gut microbiome diversity and hypertension severity.",
    "abstract": "Stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and blood pressure measurements were categorized per AHA guidelines. Hence, 130 adults from three ethnic groups to assess differences in gut microbiome diversity and their association with hypertension severity were studied. Significant ethnic variations were observed in microbial composition, particularly in Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios. Greater microbial diversity was associated with lower hypertension severity in certain ethnicities. Thus, we show ethnic-specific microbiome patterns may influence hypertension outcomes.",
