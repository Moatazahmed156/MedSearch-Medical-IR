    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      To examine the persistent global disparities in breast cancer outcomes, focusing on inequities in access to essential therapeutics, diagnostics, and emerging innovations, while highlighting current policy actions and international initiatives addressing these gaps.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Although survival rates for breast cancer have improved in high-income countries, significant inequalities remain in low- and middle-income settings. Access to timely diagnosis, standard treatments, and novel therapeutics such as targeted agents and immunotherapies is uneven. Recent global initiatives, including the WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative, aim to enhance early detection, standardize care pathways, and improve access to affordable, quality-assured treatments. Policy frameworks are increasingly addressing issues of availability, affordability, and infrastructure, yet implementation remains inconsistent.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Bridging global breast cancer disparities demands coordinated action integrating health system strengthening, policy reform, and international collaboration. Equitable access to therapeutics and diagnostics must be prioritized to ensure that advancements in breast cancer care translate into improved outcomes worldwide.",
