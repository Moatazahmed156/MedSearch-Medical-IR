Primary care physicians, who care for 70% of all heart-failure patients, have opportunities to reduce the economic and mortality impact of this disease by improved outpatient management.

Successful completion of these tasks will lead to an improvement in functional capacity, fewer hospitalizations, and longer lives for heart-failure patients.",
