    "abstract": "Premenopausal women--especially young women--with endometrial cancer stage I may be treated successfully with progestins alone as primary therapy to preserve their child-bearing potential. There is some indication that progestins could be used in neoadjuvant fashion. Individualization of adjuvant treatment with radiation or progestins and in combination seems possible. Progestins have an established place in the palliative treatment of women with advanced cancer. In addition, progestins can be used in advanced and/or recurrent endometrial cancer in combination with chemotherapy and tamoxifen.",
