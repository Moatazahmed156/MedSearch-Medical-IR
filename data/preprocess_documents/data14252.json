    "abstract": "To synthesize recent advances in developmental biology, mechanobiology, metabolism, and tissue engineering as they relate to cartilage biology and osteoarthritis (OA). Narrative review integrating peer-reviewed studies covering chondrocyte ontogeny, mechanical and metabolic regulation, disease pathogenesis, and regenerative strategies. SOX9 OA arises from disruption of conserved developmental, metabolic, and mechanical programs. Targeted interventions restoring transcriptional fidelity, metabolic balance, and tissue mechanics offer translational promise.",
