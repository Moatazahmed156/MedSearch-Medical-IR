    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia as well as insulin resistance and is affecting the lives of a huge population across the globe. Genetic mutations, obesity and lack of physical activity constitute the possible factors that can lead to onset and progression of this disorder. However, there is another major factor that can be the root cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus and that is an imbalance in the microorganisms that inhabit the gut. The gut microbiome is a vital component that needs to be given significant attention because any \"dysbiosis\" in the colonic microorganisms can transform the host from a state of health to a state of disease. This transformation is quite obvious since the gut barrier integrity, host metabolism such as sensitivity to insulin and maintaining blood glucose level are carried out by the tiny organisms inhabiting our intestine. In fact, the normal functioning of the human body is accredited to the microbes, particularly the bacteria, because they generate their metabolites that communicate with host cells and maintain normal physiology. Giving importance to gut health is, therefore, necessary to prevent metabolic diseases that can be maintained by the intake of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics along with healthy diet. The tiny microorganisms in the gut that keep our body free of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus need to be in a state of 'eubiosis', else the consequences of disturbance in gut microbes can progress to serious complications in the host.",
