    "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, are associated with growth failure. Growth failure appears to be correlated with both the effects of inflammation and negative effects of glucocorticoids (used as therapeutic option) on the growth hormone axis and locally on the growth plate and bone metabolism. In the last decade, the introduction of biologics has changed the disease course regarding consequences and outcomes. Anyway in some cases, treatment with biologics has failed in restoring normal growth in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis; in contrast, several studies have reported improved height velocity and growth rate in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with growth hormone. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of growth hormone treatment on the growth and pubertal development in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients through a narrative review of the literature over the last four decades.",
