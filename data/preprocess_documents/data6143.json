Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and insulin resistance are major risk factors in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease refers to a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.",
