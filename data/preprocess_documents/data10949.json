    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health burden in India with limited real-world data on triple inhaler therapy. This prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm, phase 4 study (October 2023-August 2024) assessed the effectiveness and safety of glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate/budesonide (GFB) triple therapy, administered as metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or dry-powder inhaler (DPI), in Indian COPD patients. Symptomatic patients aged ≥40 years with minimum one exacerbation in the past year and receiving dual or monotherapy were included. GFB was delivered as MDI or DPI based on physician and patient preference. Primary outcomes were changes from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV",
