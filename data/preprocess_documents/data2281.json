    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting elderly individuals, characterized by cognitive decline and dysfunction in the nervous system. The disease is hallmarked by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β plaques. Approximately 10.7% of the global population aged 65 and above suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and this number is projected to rise significantly in the foreseeable future. By the year 2050, the worldwide prevalence is estimated to reach 139 million cases, compared to the current 55 million cases. The identification of reliable biomarkers that can facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a significant role in mRNA regulation and protein level maintenance through mRNA degradation. Over the past decade, researchers have primarily focused on elucidating the functions and expression patterns of miRNAs in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, to uncover their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This review emphasizes the potential of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and explores their roles and therapeutic possibilities. MiRNAs possess several features that make them ideal biomarkers, including their ability to be easily detected in body fluids. Moreover, the extraction process is minimally invasive, as miRNAs can be readily extracted. Advances in technology have facilitated the integration of miRNAs into micro-assays, enhancing the reliability and utility of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.",
