    "abstract": "The demographic change and continuously improving healthcare lead to increasing numbers of older, comorbid patients in elective orthopedic surgery. Perioperative risk assessment is crucial for patient counseling and preoperative planning. Risk factors, such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, anemia, malnutrition, obesity, smoking and insufficiently controlled diabetes mellitus are common in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. A thorough and early screening not only enables the individual assessment of the risk profile but in an elective setting also enables the chance for modification of certain risk factors in order to reduce the individual perioperative risk. Meanwhile, recommendations regarding risk stratification and adjustment of modifiable risk factors are included in national guidelines on the indications for elective total hip arthroplasty.",
