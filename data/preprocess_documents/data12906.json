    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Other tauopathies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) share pathological hallmarks centered on abnormal tau biology. Increasing evidence highlights the role of post-translational modifications in modulating these pathogenic processes. Among these, glycosylation, the enzymatic attachment of glycans to proteins or lipids, has emerged as a critical regulator of protein folding, trafficking, aggregation, and clearance. Both ",
