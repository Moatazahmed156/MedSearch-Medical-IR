    "title": "From Skin to Brain: Key Genetic Mediators Associating Cutaneous Inflammation and Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory skin diseases and neurodegenerative disorders share overlapping genetic, immunologic, and metabolic pathways that may predispose individuals to cognitive decline. This review synthesizes current human genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatic evidence linking psoriasis, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Literature from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar was examined, prioritizing studies integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Among inflammatory dermatoses, psoriasis exhibits the strongest overlap with dementia genetics, with shared susceptibility loci including ",
