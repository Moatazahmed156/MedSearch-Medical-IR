    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Several studies have attempted to identify an objective description of the aesthetically ideal breast, but they have all suffered in their reliability because of having several intrinsic limitations. It is therefore essential to design a template of ideal breast features in order to predict and evaluate aesthetic outcomes in both reconstructive and cosmetic breast surgery. The aim of this study was to determine the aesthetically preferred position of the nipple- areola complex on the breast.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A questionnaire was sent by regular mail to 1000 men and 1000 women aged between 16 and 74 years. They were asked to rank the attractiveness of a series of breasts of women in images with different NAC positions. The images showed breasts from two different angles: 12 frontal-view images with both breasts shown, and five sideview images with only one breast shown. All of the breasts had equal dimensions and proportions, with the same areola size but different NAC positions. Statistical analysis of data was carried out.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eight hundred and thirteen of 2000 participants completed the questionnaire. The NAC placement preferred by both genders had a ratio of 40:60 x and 50:50 y, which means that it was best situated in the middle of the breast gland vertically and slightly lateral to the midpoint horizontally. Significant differences were found between the age and gender subgroup preferences.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study identified the preferred position of the nipple-areola complex on the female breast in the general population. This is an important information when planning breast reconstructive and cosmetic surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence ii:\n        \n      \n      This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
