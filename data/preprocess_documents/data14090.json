    "title": "Genicular Nerve Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Chronic Knee Pain: Systematic Review with Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation (GnRFA) for chronic knee pain using a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (BNMA). The search identified 1,740 records, with 358 full texts reviewed and 29 studies included (13 randomized controlled trials and 16 observational studies, totaling 2,285 participants) GnRFA was most likely to be the highest ranked treatment for chronic knee treatment at 1 month (86.3%), 3 month (75.3%), 6 month (74.3%), and 12 months (75.0%) when compared to sham, intra-articular joint injections, and chemical neurolysis. GnRFA serves as an effective treatment for chronic knee pain from either OA or PPSP for at least 12 months. Additionally, it was found to be more effective than sham for at least 6 months.",
