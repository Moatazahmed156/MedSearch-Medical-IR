    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 globally impacted the humanity causing tragic outcomes; costing millions of lives, destroying economies and demolishing public health infrastructures. The emergence of vaccines using various ingenious approaches in less than a year was deemed the light at the end of the tunnel. However, recent emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in several parts of the world revealed that another hurdle is ahead in the fight against COVID-19. This review will highlight how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, creating different virus variants could potentially impact virus pathogenesis as well as different therapy approaches and vaccine design.",
