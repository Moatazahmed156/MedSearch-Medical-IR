    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer represents a major global health concern and obesity adds complicates its surgical management. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of robotic-assisted surgery and standard laparoscopic surgery in obese colorectal cancer patients. A comprehensive literature search performed across databases from inception to April 2024. Pooled estimates included hospital stay duration, drainage tube removal time, first ventilation time, complication rates, re-admission rates and re-operative rates. Six studies involving 4215 patients were included. Robotic-assisted surgery was associated with a statistically significant but modest reduction in hospital stay time compared to laparoscopic surgery (",
