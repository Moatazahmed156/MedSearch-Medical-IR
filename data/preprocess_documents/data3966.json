    "abstract": "We compared, in volunteers, the effect of propofol (PROP) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) sedation on autonomic nervous activities and subjective feelings during psychological stresses. In a crossover design, 25 subjects received PROP and DEX titrated to a bispectral index value of 75 to 85. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and salivary alpha-amylase (objective indices) and a faces anxiety scale (subjective index) were assessed. Subjects were asked their preference between 2 sedatives. Objective indices showed similar changes in both groups. The faces anxiety scale decreased only in the PROP group and subjects preferred PROP. Propofol more effectively suppressed anxious feelings compared with DEX during sedation.",
