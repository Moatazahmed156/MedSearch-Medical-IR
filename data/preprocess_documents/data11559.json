    "abstract": "Climate variability and air pollution adversely affect stroke, yet comprehensive global assessments are lacking. This study investigates their impact on age-standardized stroke mortality rates (ASMR) from 2000-2020. We analyzed 179 countries using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) data for stroke ASMR, European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) climate data, and air pollution data (nitrogen dioxide [NO Global stroke ASMR substantially decreased from 2000-2020, driven by increased SDI and reduced smoking. Each 2.34% decrease in negative humidity deviance increased ASMR by 0.98/100,000 (95% CI: 0.21-1.76;  These associations suggest potential benefits from addressing climate variability mitigation, air pollution control, and stroke prevention to reduce global stroke mortality burden.",
