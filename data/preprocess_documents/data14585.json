    "abstract": "In light of the growing trend of global population ageing, chronic diseases have become a major challenge for global public health, and promoting healthy lifestyles has emerged as a critical strategy for reducing the disease burden and enhancing health benefits. There has been a surge in research on healthy lifestyles and health outcomes. However, there are significant variations in the healthy lifestyle scores of different studies, limiting the comparability of findings and a notable absence of reviews on the in-depth integration of the components of healthy lifestyle scores. This study provides a comprehensive review of healthy lifestyle scores, their components, and calculation methods, to provide more references for the construction of healthy lifestyle scores. 随着全球人口老龄化趋势的加剧，慢性病已成为全球公共卫生的重大挑战，促进健康生活方式已成为减轻疾病负担、提升健康效益的关键策略。当前，有关健康生活方式与健康结局的相关研究呈快速增长趋势，但不同研究的评分之间差异较大，限制研究之间的可比性，同时有关健康生活方式评分构成等深度整合的综述较为缺乏。本研究针对健康生活方式评分及其构成要素和计算方法进行综合分析，以期为健康生活方式评分构建提供更多参考依据。.",
