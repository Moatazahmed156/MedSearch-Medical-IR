    "abstract": "Variants in GBA1 represent the most prevalent genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD), yet how environmental exposures interact with these mutations to drive disease remains unclear. Epidemiological evidence implicates high dairy consumption as a potential modifiable risk factor for PD, but the mechanistic basis remains elusive. Here, we identify hepatic deposition of phosphorylated α-synuclein (pα-syn) in two PD patients carrying the pathogenic GBA1 L444P variant with histories of excessive dairy intake. Using Gba1",
