    "abstract": "Stem cell therapy in regenerative medicine has a scope for treating ocular diseases. Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.",
