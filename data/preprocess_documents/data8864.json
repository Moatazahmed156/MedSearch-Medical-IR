Part 2 of this continuing medical education series outlines the steps of performing a QI project, from identifying QI opportunities, to carrying out successive Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, to hard-wiring improvements into the system. QI frameworks will be explored and readers will understand how to interpret basic QI data.",
