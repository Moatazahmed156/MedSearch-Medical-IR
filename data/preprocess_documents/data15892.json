    "title": "Digital Technologies in a Post-Pandemic Southeast Asia: Measures for Enhancing Regional Approaches.",
    "abstract": "The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has taken some measures to advance collective action to accelerate telehealth in the region. Still, it has encountered the problem of digital readiness and digital health preparedness disparities within the region. To maintain the consolidation of digital health utilization across ASEAN member states, this article offers policy recommendations to address the diverse approaches taken and compensate for capacity differences among members. Drawing on insights from published official policies, government health ministry websites of Southeast Asian nations, and ASEAN's digital health policies, the article first reviews the diversities of digital technologies in a post-pandemic Southeast Asia and then assesses measures to enhance regional approaches. Several recommendations are presented: First, ASEAN can standardize regional frameworks for telehealth by sharing digital health transformation blueprints and leveraging ASEAN and ASEAN Plus forums to bridge divergent understandings and advance the region's digital health initiatives. Second, ASEAN facilitates investment through a telehealth sandbox and fosters collaboration among stakeholders. Although the recommendations are consistent with the 'ASEAN Way,' lingering concerns in Southeast Asia's telehealth landscape include different commitments and expectations, risks of privacy infringements, and the misuse of technology in the region's authoritarian states.",
