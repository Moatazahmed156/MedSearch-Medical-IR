    "abstract": "Congenital urinary tract disorders of young cats may result from heritable (genetic) or acquired disease processes that affect differentiation and growth of the developing urinary tract, or from similar disease processes that eventually affect the structure or function of the mature urinary system. Although congenital diseases of the feline lower urinary tract are uncommon, clinical signs associated with these anomalies may be indistinguishable from those of other acquired causes of lower urinary tract disease. Early detection and proper management of congenital disorders may result in restoration of urinary bladder and urethral function and/or progressive urinary tract dysfunction.",
