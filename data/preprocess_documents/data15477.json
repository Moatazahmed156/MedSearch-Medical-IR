    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains a serious global public health threat due to its inherent and acquired resistance to clinical drugs. Meanwhile, the genomic sequences of many clinical isolates are informative to find novel drugs. Most drug-resistant mutations are clustered in the antibiotics-binding region of the targets, reducing affinity with antibiotics and diminishing the efficacy of antibiotics. However, the roles of mutations outside the drug-binding regions remain elusive. RNA polymerase encoded by rpoB is the primary target of the first-front antibiotics of rifampicin. Here, we found that many clinical isolates with RpoB K446 residue mutation, which does not directly interact with rifampicin, are susceptible to rifampicin. Further genetic experiments demonstrated that defective prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein modification (pupylation) of the RpoB",
