    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To explore the application of touching combined with intelligent interaction of voice and rhythm in the nursing of neonatal feeding intolerance and its effect on the quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 140 newborns with feeding intolerance treated in our hospital from April 2019 to April 2021 were selected. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the study group. The control group received touch nursing and the study group received touch combined with intelligent interactive nursing mode of voice, music, and rhythm. The general data, feeding performance, feeding process, growth and development, feeding intolerance, total intestinal feeding, jaundice duration, hospital stay, and quality of life scores were compared between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      First of all, we compared the general data of the two groups. There was no significant difference in gestational age, sex, mode of delivery, birth weight, head circumference, body length, Apgar score, and other general data between the two groups. Second, we compared the feeding performance of the two groups. Before nursing, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). After nursing, the feeding rate, milk intake ratio, and proficiency of the two groups increased, and the comparison between the two groups. The feeding rate, milk intake ratio, and proficiency of the study group were better than those of the control group. In terms of the feeding process of the two groups, the days of oral feeding, complete import feeding, feeding conversion, and indwelling gastric tube in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In terms of the growth and development of the two groups, the recovery time of birth weight in the study group was lower than that in the control group, and the growth of body weight, length, and head circumference at 14 days in the study group was higher than those in the control group. The feeding intolerance, the duration of jaundice, and the days of hospitalization in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the feeding intolerance, the duration of jaundice, and the days of hospitalization in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Finally, we compared the scores of qualities of life between the two groups. The physiological function, psychological function, and social function of the study group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The physiological function, psychological function, and social function of the study group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The application of touching combined with phonetic rhythm intelligent interaction technology in the nursing of neonatal feeding intolerance can promote the faster development and maturity of neonatal gastrointestinal function, improve gastrointestinal motility, shorten the time of parenteral nutrition in newborns, achieve total enteral feeding faster, and promote neonatal growth and development, so as to shorten the duration of hospitalization, improve the tolerance of neonatal gastrointestinal feeding, and improve the quality of life.",
