Emerging evidence has established a compelling association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and CRC pathogenesis, revealing complex mechanisms through which specific bacterial communities modulate carcinogenesis. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanistic contributions of gut microbiota to CRC development, with particular emphasis on key pathogenic bacteria including ",
