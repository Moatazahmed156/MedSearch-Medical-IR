    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising among adults under 55 years, but its causes remain unclear. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to identify risk factors for early-onset CRC (EOCRC). We pooled three large European prospective cohort studies, examining 14 known or suspected risk factors with EOCRC (diagnosed <55 years, N = 1369) and later-onset CRCs (LOCRC) (diagnosed ≥55 years, N = 13,490). Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Higher body mass index (BMI, per 5 kg/m Adiposity, physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol consumption are risk factors for EOCRC. Risk factors were largely similar between EOCRC and LOCRC, except for adiposity, with stronger EOCRC association in men.",
