    "abstract": "To explore the independent risk factors for technical survival in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), construct a nomogram model for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year technical survival rates, and validate the clinical value of nursing interventions in improving PD patients' prognosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 475 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who received PD at Huangshi Central Hospital from February 2010 to April 2025. Patients were randomly divided into a training group ( Spearman correlation analysis showed that PD duration was negatively correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine (Scr), peritonitis, catheter-related complications, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score, and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) score, while positively correlated with years of education, DUV, albumin level, number of primary caregivers, and frequency of health education (all  The constructed nomogram can accurately predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year technical survival rates of PD patients. Enhanced health education (≥1 session/month), optimized caregiving support systems, improved psychological conditions, and narrowed urban-rural disparities in healthcare resources are effective nursing interventions to improve the technical survival outcomes of PD patients.",
