    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Despite the prevalence of weight loss programs, their success rates remain discouraging, with around half of individuals regaining lost weight within two years. The primary objective of this review is to explore the factors contributing to the failure of weight loss programs and to provide insights into effective weight management strategies.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Factors contributing to the failure of weight loss programs include the impracticality of restrictive diets, potential metabolic impacts, limited focus on lifestyle changes, genetic predispositions, psychological influences, socioeconomic status, and medical conditions. A holistic approach considering these factors is crucial for safe and sustainable weight loss. Key findings indicate the importance of holistic approaches to weight management, including lifestyle modifications, medical interventions, and behavioral and psychological strategies. Effective weight loss strategies emphasize low-calorie, nutrient-rich diets, regular physical activity, and interventions tailored to individual needs. Combining multiple approaches offers the best chance of successful weight management and improved health outcomes. This review provides insights into the complexities of obesity management and the factors contributing to the failure of weight loss programs. It highlights the necessity of adopting a holistic approach that addresses dietary habits, physical activity, genetic factors, psychological well-being, and socioeconomic influences. Recommendations include implementing lifestyle modifications, medical interventions when necessary, and integrating behavioral and psychological support to achieve sustainable weight loss and mitigate the global health challenge posed by obesity.",
