    "abstract": "Heart diseases remain one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating innovative diagnostic methods for early detection and intervention. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-known technique for the preliminary diagnosis of heart conditions. However, it can not be used for continuous monitoring due to skin irritation. It is well known that every body organ generates a magnetic field, and the heart generates peak amplitudes of about 10 to 100 pT (measured at a distance of about 3 cm above the chest). This poses challenges to capturing such signals. This paper reviews the different techniques used to capture the heart's magnetic signals along with their limitations. In addition, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the different approaches that use the heart-generated magnetic field to diagnose several heart diseases. This research reveals two aspects. First, as a noninvasive tool, the use of the heart's magnetic field signal can lead to more sensitive advanced heart disease diagnosis tools, especially when continuous monitoring is possible and affordable. Second, its current use is limited due to the lack of accurate, affordable, and portable sensing technology.",
