    "abstract": "Breast cancer characterized as \"cold tumors\" exhibit low levels of immune cell infiltration, which limits the efficacy of conventional immunotherapy. Recent studies have focused on strategies using nanotechnology combined with tumor microenvironment modulation to transform \"cold tumors\" into \"hot tumors\". This approach involves the use of functionalized nanoparticles that target and modify the tumor microenvironment to promote the infiltration and activation of antitumor immune cells. By delivering immune activators or blocking immunosuppressive signals, these nanoparticles activate otherwise dormant immune responses, enhancing tumor immunogenicity and the therapeutic response. These strategies not only promise to increase the response rate of breast cancer patients to existing immunotherapies but also may pave new therapeutic avenues, providing a new direction for the immunotherapy of breast cancer.",
