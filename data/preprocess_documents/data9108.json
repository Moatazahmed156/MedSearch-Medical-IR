    "abstract": "A review is presented of the methods used for estimation of protein content in solutions. These methods are based on measuring of some organic dyes binding with protein--amido-black 10B, coomassy brilliant blue R-250 and G-250, ponso G, violet sulfate, bromphenol blue, naphthol yellow S, orange G. Advantages and limitations of these methods were compared with Lowry et al (1951) method and with some other conventional methods for estimation of protein content. The methods based on dye binding might provide additional information and substitute the Lowry method if an adequate protein is selected for a calibration plot.",
