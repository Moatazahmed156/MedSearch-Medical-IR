    "abstract": "Introduction With increasing development and use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for weight loss in overweight and obese populations, it is timely to gain greater insight into consumer experience with these technologies. The aims of this review were to identify common themes across studies that included user preferences for mHealth intervention for weight loss. Methods The databases PubMed (Medline), CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant qualitative studies on mHealth for weight loss. Searches were conducted in May 2016. Results Several common high preference themes were identified relating to simple and attractive apps that allowed for self-monitoring with feedback. The five key themes concerning text messages for weight loss involved a careful consideration of personalization, message tone, structure, frequency and content. Key optimization themes for weight loss apps were personalization, simplicity with appeal and engagement/entertainment. Common identified benefits of mHealth for weight loss included self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, ability to motivate, educate, and remind. Common barriers users identified were related to technological and psychological issues as well as message overload/inappropriate timing of messages. Conclusion When planning an mHealth weight loss intervention, critical factors are the message tone, structure and the frequency of message delivery. Personalization also seems to be important. Designing simple apps while still ensuring that they engage the user is also essential. Additionally, it seems important to tailor the content in accordance with different target group demographic preferences. The successful reach and adoption of mHealth interventions requires minimizing perceived barriers and maximizing perceived benefits.",
