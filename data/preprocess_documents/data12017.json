    "abstract": "Chronic shoulder pain/disability is a significant cause of morbidity among breast cancer survivors, which can persist for several years postsurgery, thus markedly impacting their quality of life. The condition is a multifactorial and polygenic trait. In this overarching context, we report here on the polygenic effects through polymorphisms in opioid signaling and pain pathways, specifically, the (1) ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 gene-catechol-O-methyltransferase (",
