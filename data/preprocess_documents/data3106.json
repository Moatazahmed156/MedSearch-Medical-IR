    "abstract": "Males are under-represented in weight loss clinical trials, usually comprising fewer than one-quarter of participants. Our study aimed to investigate people's motivations for participating in weight loss trials and determine any relationship with gender. Eighty individuals from an existing registry for weight loss trials were contacted, of whom 24 (9 males, 15 females) agreed to participate in a 20-min semi-structured interview around their expectations and motivations for volunteering. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in Zoom. A transcript of each interview was uploaded into NVivo for preliminary thematic analysis. Improved health was a common motivation for pursuing weight loss in all subjects regardless of gender. Male recruitment to weight loss trials was often influenced by advice from a healthcare professional to lose weight for the prevention of obesity-related comorbidities, whereas family and aesthetic expectations (e.g., clothes and fashion) were key elements of female participation. Identification of gender differences in motivations for volunteering in weight loss trials will help improve tailoring of recruitment strategies and interventions to enhance male participation in the future.",
