    "abstract": "Excessive production of reactive oxygen species is an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of diabetes associated macrovascular and microvascular complications including diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by glomerular enlargement, early albuminuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis. The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is multi-factorial and the precise mechanisms are unclear. Hyperglycemia-mediated dysregulation of various pathways either enhances the intensity of oxidative stress or these pathways are affected by oxidative stress. Thus, oxidative stress has been considered as a central mediator in progression of nephropathy in patients with diabetes. In this review, we have focused on current perspectives in oxidative stress signaling to determine common biological processes whereby diabetes-induced oxidative stress plays a central role in progression of diabetic nephropathy.",
