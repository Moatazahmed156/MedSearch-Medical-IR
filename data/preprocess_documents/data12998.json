    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), acknowledged as the leading cause of dementia, is defined by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. This condition presents a significant challenge to global health due to its complex and multifaceted characteristics. Pharmacological treatments for AD mainly focus on relieving symptoms instead of addressing the fundamental progression of the condition. Currently, there are three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) that can be used for the treatment of AD: donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, along with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine. Although these medications can improve cognitive function and assist patients in their daily activities, it is crucial to understand that they do not halt the progression of the disease itself. Recently, innovative therapeutic strategies have been introduced for the treatment of this disease. Cell and gene therapies hold remarkable potential for the treatment of AD. Gene therapy, in particular, enables the precise modulation of AD-related genes, enhances neuroprotective factors, and mitigates the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Additionally, cell-based therapies utilizing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are designed to replace lost neurons, modulate immune responses, and restore functional neural networks. Together, these innovative techniques represent significant advancement in the treatment of AD, instilling hope for enhanced patient outcomes and a higher quality of life. In this review, we emphasize the innovative cell and gene strategies, along with in vitro and preclinical studies, that explore the potential of gene and cell-based therapies as treatments for AD.",
