    "abstract": "The efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines to prevent COVID-19 in autoimmune patients is controversial due to immunosuppressive therapies. Here, we characterized the T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects, who received as few as one or up to seven vaccine injections. The study population had different disease severities and an association with other autoimmune comorbidities. All the subjects studied showed SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T helper (Th) cells in circulation, and in most of the subjects, CD8",
