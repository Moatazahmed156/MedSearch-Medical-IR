    "abstract": "The Eerdun Wurile Basic Formula (EWB) of Mongolian medicine has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we combined transcriptomics, metabolomics, and in vivo experiments to explore the therapeutic mechanism of EWB in ischemic stroke, providing a scientific basis for clinical treatment. SD rats were divided into six groups: Sham operation group, MCAO/R group, MCAO/R + Nimodipine group, MCAO/R + EWB low-dose group (EWB-L group), MCAO/R + EWB medium-dose group (EWB-M group), and MCAO/R + EWB high-dose group (EWB-H group). The efficacy was evaluated using the Zea-Longa five-point neurological deficit score, rat survival rate, open field test, and Morris water maze test, along with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and TUNEL staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were conducted to identify key genes and metabolites, and qRT-PCR and western blot (WB) were used to verify key targets and elucidate the mechanism. Compared with the sham operation group, the model group exhibited significant neurological deficits in rats ( In summary, this study revealed that EWB reduces neuroinflammation and protects against ischemic stroke by modulating SLC17A6, SLC6A11, SLC6A9, ADORA1, GNG7, and the NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as regulating metabolites such as adenosine monophosphate and succinic acid.",
