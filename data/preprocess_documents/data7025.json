    "abstract": "Hereditary ovarian cancer occurs rarely in the general population but may appear in up to 85% of the offspring of affected women. Pedigree analysis remains the main diagnostic tool. Aberrations of BRCA-1 gene, located on 17q12-21, are considered to be the reason for the genetic expression of ovarian cancer. Hereditary ovarian cancer is characterized by bilateralism, usually stage III, at operative diagnosis, mostly serous cystadenocarcinoma type and relatively early age at onset. Hence, early follow-up is recommended in high risk patients. Prophylactic removal of the uterus and the adnexae is indicated in patients at risk.",
