    "abstract": "With an estimated one million new cases and 769 000 deaths in 2020, gastric cancer is the fifth most frequent cancer and fourth leading cause of cancer death globally. Incidence rates are highest in Asia and Eastern Europe. This manuscript will review the current modalities of diagnosis, staging, and screening of gastric cancer. We will also highlight development of novel diagnostics and advancements in endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer.",
