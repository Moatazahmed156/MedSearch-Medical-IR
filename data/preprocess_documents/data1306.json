    "abstract": "An increasing number of detection tools are available and several detection strategies have been described to pursue the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation to prevent ischemic stroke. Monitoring tools include standard electrocardiography, snapshot single-lead recordings with professional or personal devices (e.g. smartphone-based), Holter monitor, external devices with long-term recording capabilities, and cardiac implantable electronic devices, including pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators and insertable cardiac monitors. Insertable cardiac monitors have shown high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of atrial fibrillation, allow up to three years of continuous monitoring, do not require cooperation of the patient, are well tolerated, have a short device-related time delay between detection of atrial fibrillation and notification to the physician, provide information on atrial fibrillation burden and are minimally invasive. On the other hand, insertable cardiac monitors require a considerable use of resources to process the recordings and have a significant initial cost. Studies conducted with insertable cardiac monitors on patients with prior stroke and on patients with risk factors for stroke but no prior cerebrovascular events or atrial fibrillation have consistently shown a measurable incidence of atrial fibrillation at follow-up. However, the effectiveness of oral anticoagulations in reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation lasting less than 24 h, though reasonable, is currently unproven. The future of atrial fibrillation detection tools and atrial fibrillation detection strategies will be influenced by ongoing studies exploring whether oral anticoagulations reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation burden lower than 24 h.",
