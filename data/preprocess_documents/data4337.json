    "abstract": "Granulosa cells are essential for follicle initiation and development, and their abnormal function or apoptosis is a crucial factor leading to follicular atresia. A state of oxidative stress occurs when the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the regulation of the antioxidant system is disturbed. Oxidative stress is one of the most important causes of the abnormal function and apoptosis of granulosa cells. Oxidative stress in granulosa cells causes female reproductive system diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and premature ovarian failure. In recent years, studies have confirmed that the mechanism of oxidative stress in granulosa cells is closely linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, FOXO axis, Nrf2 pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and mitophagy. It has been found that drugs such as sulforaphane, Periplaneta americana peptide, and resveratrol can mitigate the functional damage caused by oxidative stress on granulosa cells. This paper reviews some of the mechanisms involved in oxidative stress in granulosa cells and describes the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological treatment of oxidative stress in granulosa cells.",
