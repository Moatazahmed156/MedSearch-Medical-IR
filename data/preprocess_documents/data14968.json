    "abstract": "Exosomes derived from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected hepatocytes (HBV-Exo) promote liver fibrosis. Emerging evidence implicates METTL3 and P2RX7 as critical drivers of liver fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HBV-Exo drive hepatic fibrosis remain poorly understood. This study investigated the mechanistic involvement of METTL3 and P2RX7 in this fibrotic process. Exosomes from pHBV1.3-transfected, HBV-replicating THLE-2 hepatocytes (HBV-THLE-2-Exo) were isolated and used to incubate LX-2 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Impacts on LX-2 cells were evaluated by detecting cell viability, proliferation, invasion, migration, and fibrosis marker expression. MeRIP, RIP, RNA pull-down, and mRNA stability assays were used to assess the METTL3/P2RX7 mRNA interaction. A CCl",
