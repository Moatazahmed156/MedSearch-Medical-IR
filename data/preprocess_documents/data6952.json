    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review the application progress of proteomics technology in brain injury research in recent years, point out the current problems that need to be overcome, and explore the application prospects of proteomics analysis in brain injury. This study also aims to retrieve all literature on brain injury and proteomics and summarize it. Through searching and screening, the widespread application of proteomics technology in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the use of a large number of TBI biomarkers were discovered. The pathways mediated by some biomarkers and the physiological and pathological mechanisms of occurrence were elucidated. The current classification of brain injury is mainly based on subjective evaluation of clinical symptoms, combined with objective imaging. However, its practical value is often limited when applied to prognosis evaluation in brain injury. Proteomics technology can make up for this deficiency and provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of brain injury.",
