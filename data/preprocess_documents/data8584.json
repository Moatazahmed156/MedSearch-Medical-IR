    "abstract": "Wound healing in mammals occurs by a process of regeneration and scar tissue production. In particular, epithelium has marked regenerative capacity. Healing is an active process from the moment the wound is inflicted--a \"lag\" phase does not exist. In surgery the important factors affecting wound healing are protein deficiency, uremia, corticosteroids, and local tissue injury. Stimulants to wound healing are not available for clinical application.",
