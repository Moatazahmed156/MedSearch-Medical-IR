    "abstract": "From analysis of observations over 61 spinal patients with acute and neglected injuries to the spinal cord the authors conclude that the use of local hypothermia of the spinal cord in the postoperative period has a favorable effect: reduces the muscle tonus, prevents edema, pain formation, and hemorrhage occurring after surgical intervention on the spinal cord, and produces an analgesic effect. Further mastering of the techniques of hypothermia is necessary.",
