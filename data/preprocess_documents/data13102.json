    "title": "Metabolic Astrocytic Support with Decanoic Acid Enhances Energy Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease Models.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder of cerebral energy metabolism, where impaired glucose utilization contributes to disease pathology. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), such as decanoic acid (C10), have emerged as promising metabolic substrates due to their ability to bypass glycolytic deficits and support mitochondrial function. In this study, we investigated the metabolic impact of C10 in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes carrying familial AD mutations.
