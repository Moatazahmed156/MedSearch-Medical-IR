    "abstract": "The accurate control of immune responses in the tumor microenvironment is crucial for augmenting anti-cancer immunity. This work examined the function of STAT3 in modulating epigenetic and epitranscriptomic pathways during the differentiation of CD4 + T helper cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Employing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, STAT3 was specifically eliminated in CD4",
