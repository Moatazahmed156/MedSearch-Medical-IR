    "title": "Genetic Determinants of Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Comprehensive Review.",
    "abstract": "Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) encompasses fibrosing interstitial lung diseases marked by relentless scarring of the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Although its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, recent genetic discoveries have shed light on the molecular mechanisms that drive PPF onset and progression. This comprehensive review summarizes current knowledge of PPF genetics, highlighting both rare pathogenic variants and more common susceptibility polymorphisms. Key genetic contributors include telomere maintenance genes, surfactant protein genes, and the ",
