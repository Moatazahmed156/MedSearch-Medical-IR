    "abstract": "Circulating angiotensin (Ang) II has well-known endocrine properties in the cardiovasculature. AngII, produced de novo within the heart, has various autocrine and paracrine properties on resident cells expressed via AT(1) receptor-ligand binding. Herein, we review the heart's renin-angiotensin system and its role in connective tissue turnover involving heart valve leaflets and fibrous tissue that appears at sites of injury, such as following myocardial infarction.",
