    "abstract": "Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) were discovered in the gastrointestinal tract over 100 years ago and since then numerous digestive tract pathologies involving ICCs have been described. Many researchers explored ICCs presence and function in the upper urinary tract. Currently, we know that ICCs have potential plasticity, their own spontaneous activity and that they are responsible for Ca2+ waves generation and neuromuscular transmission. ICCs are also involved in the conjugation, propagation and modulation of peristaltic waves in the upper urinary tract. Despite everything we know about ICCs, their role in the pathogenesis of the upper urinary tract abnormalities remains still unclear and results of published studies are confusing. The authors' intention was to review the scientific literature regarding ICCs and to summarise the current knowledge about their nature in the upper urinary tract.",
