    "abstract": "Yellowing is the main reason for deterioration of edible quality of fresh cut water chestnuts (FCWCs). The mechanism of aurone inhibiting the yellowing of FCWCs was studied. FCWCs were treated with aurone (0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 %). The controls yellowed completely on day 9. The treatment sample with 1.0 % aurone did not yellow on day 9. Compared to the controls, aurone (1.0 %) completely inhibited the production of eriodictyol during 9 d of storage. Aurone (1.0 %) reduced peroxidase activity of FCWCs by 23 % on day 9. The effects of aurone on naringenin concentration, polyphenol oxidase activity, phenylalanine lyase activity, number of thermophilic bacteria colonies, and number of yeasts and molds colonies of FCWCS were not significant. Aurone reduced the yellowing by decreasing the yield of eriodictyol and inhibiting POD activity. Aurone (1.0 %) can be used to inhibit the yellowing of FCWCs in practice.",
