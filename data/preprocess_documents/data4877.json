    "abstract": "Purpose: Endometrial cancer is a very common type of cancer in females worldwide. Advances in diagnosis and treatment have not decreased the incidence of endometrial cancer. Lately, research has been focused on revealing the molecular and genetic characteristics of endometrial cancer in order to provide new insights in the biology of this entity, leading hopefully to innovating therapies. Research has revealed that epigenetic modifications govern endometrial carcinogenesis. In this review, the epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in endometrial cancer as well as the differences between the different types of endometrial cancer are discussed. The review also refers to the putative therapeutic benefits that hopefully can arise.",
