    "abstract": "Cytopathology has emerged as a promising platform in precision oncology especially after the revolutionary change in our understanding of the concept of lung cancer etiopathogenesis. With increasing use of minimally invasive techniques for sample acquisition, it becomes almost mandatory to utilize precious cytology samples maximally and judiciously by appropriate triaging of the specimen and timely action of the cytopathology team. Existing patient management protocols require accurate morphologic and molecular diagnosis of the lung cancer specimens which needs knowledge about evolving techniques related to specimen procurement, updates of genomic variants of lung cancer and recently developed molecular testing platforms and algorithms which are capable enough to use even miniscule amount of diagnostic material. This review provides a brief knowledge about advances in cytology of lung cancer which are helpful for developing correct clinical management strategies.",
