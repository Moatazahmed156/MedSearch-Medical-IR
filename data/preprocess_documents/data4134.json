    "abstract": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathy in acromegalic patients and is often the initial complaint. However, the diagnosis of acromegaly is often made years after the diagnosis of CTS. In our case report, we describe the case of a patient in whom acromegaly was discovered after presenting bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, without having acrofacial signs. Increased awareness of signs of acromegaly in patients with CTS might help to shorten the diagnostic delay in acromegaly.",
