Active arthritis of the TMJ remains difficult to assess. Clinical signs and symptoms alone are unreliable, and active TMJ arthritis needs confirmation by gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In recent years, changes in treatment approach have occurred. This article discusses the latest evidence on diagnosis and treatment of JIA-associated TMJ arthritis.",
