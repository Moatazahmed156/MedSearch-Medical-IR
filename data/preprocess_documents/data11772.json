    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by a lack of targetable receptors, leading to limited treatment options and a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of azelastine, a clinically approved H1-antihistamine, for drug repositioning against TNBC and to elucidate its underlying HRH1-independent mechanism of action. Cell viability assays (CCK-8) were performed on TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) following treatment with azelastine and its major metabolite, desmethyl azelastine. After observing ambiguous clinical associations between HRH1 expression and patient prognosis, HRH1 dependency was assessed through histamine stimulation and HRH1 knockdown (siRNA). Subsequently, the role of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), found to be overexpressed in TNBC and linked to poor prognosis, was investigated using ARF1 knockdown (siRNA), co-treatment with the Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) inhibitor golgicide A (GCA), and co-treatment with the Drp1 inhibitor M-divi 1. Azelastine and desmethyl azelastine potently reduced MDA-MB-231 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, achieving cell survivals of 61.3 ± 6.1% (30 µM) and 34.9 ± 3.7% (50 µM) for azelastine, and 52.4 ± 12.5% (30 µM) for desmethyl azelastine, respectively, after 72 h, with an IC",
