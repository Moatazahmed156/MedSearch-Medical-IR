    "abstract": "Intratumoral microbiota are increasingly recognized for their impact on gastric cancer, with growing evidence highlighting their complexity and significance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the origins, heterogeneity, detection, and mechanistic roles of intratumoral microbiota in gastric carcinogenesis. In gastric cancer, intratumoral microbiota can originate from mucosal disruption and may migrate from normal adjacent tissues or be influenced by the TME. It exhibits spatial and functional heterogeneity within gastric cancer. Despite challenges in the detection of intratumoral microbiota, advances in deep sequencing and spatial omics have enhanced our understanding of microbial diversity and functionality. Mechanistically, intratumoral microbiota influence gastric cancer development through genetic and epigenetic alterations, signaling pathway modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and regulation of chronic inflammation and immune responses. These insights underscore the microbiota's dual function in both promoting and hindering tumor advancement. Therapeutically, the microbiota's impact on chemotherapy resistance and immune modulation presents opportunities for novel interventions. Integrating microbiome analysis into cancer research and leveraging microbial therapies may enable more effective, personalized treatment strategies. Future research should further elucidate the intricate microbe-tumor interactions to advance clinical applications and improve outcomes for gastric cancer patients.",
