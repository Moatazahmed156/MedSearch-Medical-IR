    "abstract": "Private science and technology enterprises are the main force in building a high-level innovative province in Zhejiang, and are also the driving force for the province's high-quality integration into the Yangtze River Delta. At present, the integration of private science and technology enterprises in Zhejiang into the Yangtze River Delta has problems such as low integration ratio, high integration difficulty, low integration level, and insufficient integration confidence. The causes of the problem mainly include the concept bottlenecks and capacity limitations of private technology companies, the institutional dilemma of cooperation between regional governments and regional business environment synergy is not high, the role of non-governmental organizations is not fully developed. To create a powerful engine that drives private technology enterprises to deeply participate in the development of the Yangtze River Delta, it should be built and strengthened from the perspective of the main role of enterprises themselves, the role of government guidance, industry associations, and other non-governmental organizations to play the role of service coordination and supervision.",
