    "abstract": "A systematic understanding of the driving mechanisms of ecosystem services (ESs) and the relationships among them is critical for successful ecosystem management. However, the impact of driving factors on the relationships between ESs and the formation of ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) remains unclear. To address this gap, we developed a modeling process that used random forest (RF) to model the ESs and ESBs of Zhejiang Province, China, in regression and classification mode, respectively, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method to interpret the underlying driving forces. We first mapped the spatial distribution of seven ESs in Zhejiang Province at a 1 × 1 km spatial resolution and then used the K-means clustering algorithm to obtain four ESBs. Combining the RF models with SHAP analysis, the results showed that each ES had key driving factors, and the relationships of synergy and trade-off between ESs were determined by the driving direction and intensity of the key factors. The driving factors affect the relationships of ESs and consequently affect the formation of ESBs. Thus, managing the dominant drivers is key to improving the supply capacity of ESs.",
