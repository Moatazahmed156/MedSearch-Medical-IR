    "abstract": "Endocrine therapy (ET) resistance is a major concern when treating estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. A combination of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and ET is the current first-line standard of care (SOC) for patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Despite the benefits of ET plus a CDK4/6i, disease progression due to endocrine resistance remains a significant challenge. More effective ETs that can overcome resistance are needed to improve clinical outcomes and maintain quality of life by delaying chemotherapy. Palazestrant is a novel oral, complete estrogen receptor antagonist (CERAN) and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that blocks both transcriptional activation function domains, AF1 and AF2, resulting in complete inhibition of ER-driven transcription, regardless of estrogen receptor 1 ( The most common type of breast cancer (BC) is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+; responds to estrogen) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2–; does not overproduce HER2 protein). Because estrogen promotes the growth of ER+, HER2– BCs, endocrine therapy (ET) that reduces the amount or the effect of estrogen is typically used to treat this BC subtype. ET is often combined with another class of medications called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) to treat ER+, HER2– advanced BC. Unfortunately, this combination eventually stops working due to mutations that develop in genes, including the estrogen receptor gene (",
