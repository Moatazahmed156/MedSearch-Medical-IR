    "abstract": "Arginine 44 (R44) is a highly conserved residue in the human GABA transporter 1 (hGAT-1), a member of the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family, which plays a critical role in regulating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. To elucidate its functional importance, we characterized three epilepsy-associated pathogenic variants - R44Q, R44P and R44W - linked to myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (MAE) and developmental delay. Building on evidence that R44 resides within the N-terminal intracellular gate and is essential for transporter function, we employed biochemical, cellular and organismal models (HEK293 cells and ",
