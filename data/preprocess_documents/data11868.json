    "title": "Fruquintinib saddles tumor immune tolerance by curbing pro-tumoral immature myeloid cell populations.",
    "abstract": "Myeloid-derived cells, particularly immature populations and tumor-associated macrophages, play a pivotal role in establishing immune tolerance and suppressing antitumor responses, thereby promoting cancer progression. Macrophage-derived lymphatic endothelial cell progenitors (M-LECP) are a population of VEGFR3/FLT4/CD310 Fruquintinib treatment significantly inhibited primary tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastases in murine models of breast (4T1 and E0771) and colorectal (CT26 and MC38) cancer, respectively. Importantly, treatment with fruquintinib remodeled the tumor immune microenvironment of MC38 tumors by increasing the percentages of CD4 Overall, our findings offer new insights into the contribution of VEGFR3/FLT4/CD310 inhibition to restoring a pro-inflammatory tumor myeloid compartment and suggest M-LECP cells as candidate fruquintinib targets to overcome immunosuppression in tumors.",
