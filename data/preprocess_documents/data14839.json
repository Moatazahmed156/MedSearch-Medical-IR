    "title": "PIEZO1 channel mechanosensing in hepatobiliary physiology and disease.",
    "abstract": "The hepatobiliary system is constantly exposed to dynamic mechanical forces, including fluid shear stress, bile canaliculi pressure, and extracellular matrix stiffness. While traditionally studied for its metabolic and detoxifying functions, it is now increasingly recognised as a mechanosensitive organ. This review focuses on PIEZO1 mechanically gated ion channels that transduce physical cues into calcium-dependent signalling events. PIEZO2, the only other PIEZO isoform, is not known to be relevant in the hepatobiliary system. We examine the current knowledge on PIEZO1 in liver physiology, highlighting its roles in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages. In health, PIEZO1 regulates key processes such as bile acid synthesis (",
