    "abstract": "DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 7 (DCAF7) is a WD-repeat adaptor that recruits substrates to the CUL4DDB1 ubiquitinligase complex, but its pan-cancer relevance and mechanistic contribution to tumor progression remain unclear. Multi-omics datasets (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic and single-cell) from 33 tumor types were integrated to define DCAF7 expression, regulation, and clinical significance. Somatic alterations and copy-number variation were analysed across cohorts, and promoter methylation and RNA modification signatures were interrogated. Immune associations were assessed by computational deconvolution and checkpoint-gene profiling. Pathway and network analyses were performed to infer DCAF7-linked programmes. Mechanistic and functional validation was conducted in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) using DCAF7 perturbation and pharmacologic Wnt inhibition. DCAF7 was overexpressed in most cancers, consistent with copy-number gain, focal promoter hypomethylation and putative m DCAF7 is frequently activated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms across cancers, associates with an immunotherapy-relevant tumour immune milieu, and drives Wnt/β-catenindependent malignant phenotypes in LIHC. These findings support DCAF7 as a prognostic biomarker and a candidate therapeutic target, particularly for stratified intervention in LIHC. DCAF7 is up-regulated in various tumours and correlates with poor prognosis, particularly in LIHC. High DCAF7 expression is linked to CD4",
