    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To assess the incidence of vascular events in patients with head and neck cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Review methods:\n        \n      \n      Primary studies identified through April 2023. Meta-analysis was performed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 146 studies included in the systematic review. Rates of events were collected in the overall group, those with chemoprophylaxis, and those that underwent surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Of 1 184 160 patients, 4.3% had a vascular event. Radiation therapy had highest risk of overall events and stroke when compared to surgery and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy had a higher risk of stroke and overall events when compared to surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Vascular events occur in 4%-5% of patients with head and neck cancer. Our data does not support the use of routine anticoagulation. Patients undergoing radiation therapy had the highest frequency of events.",
