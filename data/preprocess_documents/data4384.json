    "abstract": "Pediatric asthma is a common respiratory condition in children, characterized by a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. Evidence shows that the airways of stimulated asthmatic patients have increased oxidative stress, but the exact mechanisms through which this stress contributes to asthma progression are not fully understood. Oxidative stress originates from inflammatory cells in the airways, producing significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). External factors such as cigarette smoke, particulate matter, and atmospheric pollutants also contribute to ROS and RNS levels. The accumulation of these reactive species disrupts the cellular redox balance, leading to heightened oxidative stress, which activates cellular signaling pathways and modulates the release of inflammatory factors, worsening asthma inflammation. Therefore, understanding the sources and impacts of oxidative stress in pediatric asthma is crucial to developing antioxidant-based treatments. This review examines the sources of oxidative stress in children with asthma, the role of oxidative stress in asthma development, and the potential of antioxidants as a therapeutic strategy for pediatric asthma.",
