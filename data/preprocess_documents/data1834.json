    "abstract": "Despite the established benefits of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in various wound healing contexts, its application in head and neck surgical cases remains under-explored. This study aimed to systematically review its effectiveness, safety, and comparative efficacy. Thirty-one studies from a systematic literature search were identified and analyzed for wound healing response, overall success rate, improvements compared to conventional wound care, and variation in pressure settings, treatment lengths, and dressing change frequency. NPWT showed enhanced outcomes across diverse head and neck wounds, particularly complex post-reconstructive wounds and severe infections. Despite the predominantly case report/series evidence and lack of standardized NPWT protocols, its benefits over conventional care were clear. NPWT emerges as a promising approach for head and neck wound management, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing complications. More randomized controlled trials are needed to solidify the evidence and standardize NPWT application protocols.",
