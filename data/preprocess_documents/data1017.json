    "abstract": "A comparison of two regimens of vitamin D prophylaxis in elderly institutionalized subjects has been made. Sixty-six subjects received 2.5mg vitamin D2 by mouth in December 1982; a further group of 62 received the same dose in December 1982 and again in June 1983. Blood samples have been analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 [25(OH)D2] in 10 subjects from each group over a 12-month period. The serum 25(OH)D2 was maintained at normal concentrations for most of the year in the once-a-year dosage group but at the end of 12 months only 60% were fully protected. The twice-per-year regimen offered complete protection maintaining the serum 25(OH)D2 above the threshold associated with osteomalacia. It is concluded that a twice-yearly regimen of vitamin D supplementation is a practical method for prophylaxis in institutionalized elderly people.",
