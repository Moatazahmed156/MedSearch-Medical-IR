    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Listeriosis is a severe foodborne infection associated with high mortality. Pregnant women and newborns are at a particularly high risk of infection. However, the data on epidemiology of maternal-neonatal listeriosis in Xi'an are little known. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of maternal-neonatal listeriosis in Xi'an.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 40 cases of listeriosis confirmed by positive cultures [blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)] and admitted to the Northwest Women's and Children's Hospital (NWCH) from 2011 to 2020 were enrolled. Data from all patients were collected from the hospital's electronic medical records. Data analysis and epidemiological investigation were carried out by demographic information, time of onset, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Descriptive statistical indicators were obtained using SPSS21.0 and were expressed as median, mean, standard deviation and interquartile range.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The incidence of maternal and neonatal listeriosis in NWCH over the last decade was 5/100,000 and 10.4/100,000 respectively and Listeriosis was more likely to occur in spring and summer. The most common symptom was as follows: (I) maternal: fever (85%), abdominal pain (77%), vaginal fluid or colporrhagia (46%); (II) neonatal: respiratory distress (52%), fever (33%). Laboratary results were as follows: (I) maternal: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (100%), white blood cells (WBC) or neutrophil (NEUT#) (85%), and monocyte counts (MONO#) (77%); (II) neonatal: increased WBC (81%), MONO# (81%), CRP (78%), NEUT# and lymphocytes (73%); and elevated protein (PRO) (95%) and WBC count (86%) in CSF while decreased in glucose (GLU) (73%). Compared to neonatal group, the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in maternal group raise to a higher level (92% to 42%). The outcomes of maternal were favorable and 54% of them suffered acute chorioamnionitism. Yet neonatal deaths account for up to 33%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Listeriosis is a rare disease with extremely variable clinical characteristics in Xi'an. Our data indicated that unexplained fever, abdominal pain, signs of premature and respiratory symptoms accompanied by a progressive increase in WBC, CRP, NEUT#, MONO# even include WBC and PRO in CSF while GLU decreased, the possibility of an LM infection should be considered.",
