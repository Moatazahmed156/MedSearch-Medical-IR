    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The COVID-19 disease requires accurate diagnosis to effectively manage infection rates and disease progression. The study aims to assess the relationship between vaccination status and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values by comparing clinical, RDT and RT-PCR results.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 453 suspected COVID-19 cases were included in this study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both RDT and RT-PCR testing, with RDTs conducted on-site and RT-PCR at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) genomics laboratory. Detailed clinical, RDT, and RT-PCR results were analyzed. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and Chi-Square tests to investigate the connections between diagnostic outcomes and vaccination status, with a focusing on Ct values.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RDT results showed 34.0% negative and 65.8% positive, while RT-PCR results indicated 35.8% negative and 64.2% positive cases. The discrepancies between RDT and RT-PCR results emphasize the importance of thorough testing. No significant association was found between vaccination status and viral load, as indicated by Ct values. Among RT-PCR positive cases, 49.8% had been vaccinated, suggesting challenges in interpreting results among vaccinated individuals. Further analysis revealed that vaccination (first or second dose) had minimal impact on Ct values, indicating limited influence of vaccination status on viral load dynamics in infected individuals.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The study highlights the significant differences between RDT and RT-PCR outcomes, underscoring the need for a comprehensive testing approach. Additionally, the findings suggest that vaccination status does not significantly impact RT-PCR Ct values, complicating the interpretation of diagnostic results in vaccinated individuals, especially in breakthrough infections and potential false positives.",
