    "abstract": "We report on a girl with syndromal gonadal dysgenesis and a de novo del(18p). Genetic factors controlling gonadal development are located not only on the X chromosome, but also on autosomes. The present case suggests that one of these genes is situated on 18p. We conclude that patients with del(18p) syndrome should be evaluated for gonadal dysgenesis.",
