    "abstract": "Heart regeneration is a huge, complex area involving numerous lines of research ranging from the stem cell therapy to xenografts and bioengineering. This review will focus on two avenues of regenerative research, cardiac progenitor cells and adult cardiomyocyte proliferation, both of which offer great promise for the field of heart regeneration. However, the principles behind how this could be achieved by either technique are very different. Cardiac progenitor cells represent a population of somatic stem cells which reside within the adult heart. These cells appear to have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into the different cell types found within the adult heart and thus have the potential, if the correct stimuli can be found, to effectively regenerate a heart damaged by ischemia/infarction. Inducing adult cardiomyocytes to proliferate offers a different approach to achieving the same goal. In this case, the cardiomyocytes that remain after the damage has occurred would need to be stimulated into effecting a regenerative response. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of how heart regeneration could be achieved by either of these very different approaches.",
