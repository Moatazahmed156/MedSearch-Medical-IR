    "abstract": "Hemarthroses and muscle bleeds are well-known and well-documented complications in pediatric and young adult hemophilia patients. In contrast, deep bleeds in atypical locations can be a diagnostic challenge, since clinicians and radiologists are often unfamiliar with their clinical and radiological features. Some atypical bleeds, however, can be life-threatening or severely disabling, highlighting the need for prompt, accurate diagnosis. Rare bleeds include central nervous system bleeds (including intracranial and spinal hematomas), urogenital bleeds, intra-abdominal bleeds (mesenteric and gastrointestinal wall hematomas) and pseudo tumors in unusual locations like the sinonasal cavities. Because clinical assessment can be difficult, clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the possibility of these rare complications in their hemophilia patients, so that they can avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures and institute prompt, appropriate treatment. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the imaging features of bleeds that occur in rare locations in young (i.e., children and young adults) patients with hemophilia to make the reader more familiar with these conditions.",
