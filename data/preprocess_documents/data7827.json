    "abstract": "Periodontal disease has been associated with various systemic diseases including kidney disease. However, a causal relationship is yet to be established. One possible association is that periodontitis may cause an increased inflammatory response in kidney disease patients which in turn destroys endothelial vasculature. This may contribute to development of risk factors of kidney disease such as diabetic neuropathy and cardiovascular events leading the progression and mortality in kidney disease patients. The role of periodontal inflammation driving kidney disease is still under investigation. This review article highlights the role of periodontal inflammation in the development and progression of kidney disease. It is crucial that dental practitioners and nephrologists understand the association between periodontal and kidney disease. Early periodontal screening and educating patients about the importance of good oral hygiene may play an important role in prevention of progression of kidney disease.",
