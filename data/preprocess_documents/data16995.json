    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) caused by pathogenic variants in SLC6A1, encoding γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT-1), present with seizures and severe comorbidities including cognitive impairment, developmental delay, motor difficulties, and social deficits. Current therapies focus on seizure reduction but do not address the disabling neurobehavioral symptoms. We previously showed that 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), known as a chemical chaperone and histone deacetylase inhibitor, restores GAT-1 function and reduces seizures in both mouse models and humans with SLC6A1 variants. Here, we tested whether PBA can improve neurobehavioral deficits in the Slc6a1",
