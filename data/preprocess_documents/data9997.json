    "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are major contributors to adverse maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes. This review summarizes pivotal clinical and translational studies that have shaped the clinical approach to the prevention and treatment of preeclampsia. Early preclinical trails established the pathophysiological basis and rationale for prevention strategies culminating in the standard use low dose aspirin and the emerging potential of statins. Recent randomized trials have also demonstrated that treatment of mild chronic hypertension reduces the risk preeclampsia and associated complications. Furthermore, clinical studies examining the use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and the optimal delivery timing have defined key aspects of evidence-based preeclampsia management. Further research to identify novel therapeutic targets and refine management strategies to mitigate the persistent burden of preeclampsia is urgently needed.",
