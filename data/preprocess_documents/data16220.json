    "title": "Cardiac troponin T elevation predicts mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate if cardiac troponin values predict poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients across the range of patients of different sex and age. We examined high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels in 1050 severely ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients who had hs-cTnT data available and participated in the Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma study during the first wave (April-August 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed a continuous relationship between hs-cTnT levels and mortality in hospitalized males and females with COVID-19. This finding was present regardless of sex or age. These data indicate the prognostic ability of hs-cTnT to predict mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients across all relevant patient groups.Clinical Trials registration number: NCT04338360.",
