    "title": "Pharmacological Activation of Mitophagy Confers Neuroprotective Benefits for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.",
    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, for which no cure currently exists. Previous studies have shown that abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis and defective mitophagy occur in neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Here, we provide evidence that PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagy is impaired in multiple ALS mouse models, including the SOD1",
