    "title": "Risk Factor Analysis for Bevacizumab-induced Severe Hypertension in Advanced Breast Cancer Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Bevacizumab (BV) is used in combination with paclitaxel to treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer. However, BV frequently causes hypertension. Because patients with advanced breast cancer already have an elevated cardiovascular risk, we investigated clinical factors associated with BV-induced severe hypertension in a real-world setting. Patients with advanced breast cancer receiving BV with paclitaxel (n=67) were retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was determination of factors for the occurrence of grade ≥3 severe hypertension, considering clinical significance. We also assessed the time to symptom onset and variation in blood pressure after treatment between specific patient groups. Hypertension occurred in 73.1% of the patients, with grades 2 and 3 severity in 20.9% and 52.2%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that pre-existing hypertension at baseline was an independent risk factor for grade ≥3 hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio=3.12; 95% confidence interval=1.30-7.87;  Pre-existing hypertension is a risk factor for BV-induced severe hypertension in patients with breast cancer.",
