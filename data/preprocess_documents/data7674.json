    "abstract": "Computed tomography plays an important role for the evaluation of most patients with suspected renal injury after trauma. Intravenous urography is used for gross assessment of renal function in hemodynamically unstable patients. Renal injuries can be classified into four large groups: (1) minor renal contusion, lacerations, subcapsular hematoma, and small cortical infarcts; (2) major renal lacerations extending to the medulla with or without involvement of the collecting system; (3) catastrophic renal injuries including fragmentation of the kidney and renal pedicle vascular injuries; and (4) ureteropelvic junction injuries. Integration of the imaging findings of renal injury with clinical information is important to developing a treatment plan.",
