    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) pose a severe global health threat, yet comprehensive bibliometric analyses in this field remain limited. This systematic review employs a bibliometric methodology to identify research hotspots and emerging trends from 2020 to 2025. Literature published between January 1, 2020, and October 31, 2025, was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), Scopus, and PubMed for bibliometric analysis. Analytical tools, including VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the Bibliometrix package, were used to assess publications by number, country, institution, journal, author, and keywords. The bibliometric analysis revealed that global CRGNB research has experienced a fluctuating growth trend. China was the leading contributor, with 2,950 publications (25.5% of the total), and demonstrated significant collaboration with the USA and the UK. Major research clusters encompassed hypervirulent CRGNB strains (particularly carbapenem-resistant  CRGNB research is increasingly directed toward elucidating resistance mechanisms, improving diagnostic tools, and exploring non-antibiotic therapeutic options. Strengthening international collaboration and fostering multidisciplinary approaches are imperative to advance high-quality research and address this growing threat.",
