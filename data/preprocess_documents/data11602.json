    "title": "Oral frailty subtypes and influencing factors in older patients with ischemic stroke: a latent profile analysis.",
    "abstract": "To analyze potential subtypes and influencing factors of oral frailty in older ischemic stroke patients. To support clinical professionals in precisely identifying high-risk populations and to offer a scientific foundation for the creation of tailored and accurate nursing interventions. A total of 319 older ischemic stroke patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of the University of South China between December 2024 and February 2025 were selected using a convenience sampling technique. Various assessments were conducted, including the General Information Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, and the Oral Frailty Index-8. Different subtypes of oral frailty were explored using latent profile analysis. Univariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were performed to investigate the factors influencing the subtypes of oral frailty. Oral frailty in older ischemic stroke patients can be classified into three categories: oral function decline-high oral frailty group (21.32%); medium in all dimensions-moderate oral frailty group (27.27%); and active social participation-low oral frailty group (51.41%). Multifactorial analysis indicated that age, cognitive impairment, depression, illness recurrence, living alone, albumin, total cholesterol, prothrombin time, and homocysteine are significant factors for moderate and high levels of oral frailty. This study delineated three distinct subtypes of oral frailty. It is imperative for healthcare professionals to pay particular attention to moderate and high levels of oral frailty in older patients with ischemic stroke. Tailored care plans should be devised for various patient subgroups to enhance their oral health outcomes.",
