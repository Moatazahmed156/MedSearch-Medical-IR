    "title": "Multidimensional Interrogation of the Toxicity-Efficacy Balance in Chinese Medicinal Alkaloids via MOFs, Network Pharmacology, and Chromatography.",
    "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a revolutionary platform for addressing the inherent toxicity-efficacy paradox of bioactive alkaloids in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This review summarizes recent advances in MOF-based strategies for detoxification and potentiation of alkaloid drugs by integrating TCM holism principles with modern material science. We emphasize a methodology that combines network pharmacology for in silico prediction of multi-target mechanisms with chromatographic techniques (e.g., HPLC, LC-MS) for experimental validation of key alkaloids. Using Coptis chinensis against influenza A virus (H1N1) as an example, network pharmacology identifies modulation of TNF-α and IL-6 pathways as core mechanisms, while chromatographic analysis confirms and quantifies the predicted bioactive compounds (e.g., berberine and coptisine). This validated multi-target profile provides a rational basis for designing MOF-based systems capable of targeted co-delivery and controlled release of alkaloids, thereby achieving synergistic toxicity reduction and efficacy enhancement. It presents a robust, methodology-rich framework that bridges computational prediction, analytical validation, and precision delivery for modernizing TCM alkaloid research.",
