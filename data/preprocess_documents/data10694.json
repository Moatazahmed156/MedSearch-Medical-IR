    "abstract": "Allergic pulmonary inflammation is driven by allergen-specific Th2/Th17 responses counterregulated by tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). While early-life colonization with commensal Clostridia induces the generation of colonic Tregs, the therapeutic potential of Clostridium leptum (CL) monotherapy to treat asthma patients with comorbid gut dysbiosis remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether 14 days of oral CL administration restores gut-lung immune homeostasis and suppresses allergic inflammation via tDC/Treg induction in a dysbiosis-asthma comorbidity model. To this end, adult BALB/c mice were subjected to ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization/challenge and antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis. Interventions included 14 days of oral CL (5 × 10",
