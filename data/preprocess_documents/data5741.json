    "abstract": "Considering the bidirectional crosstalk along the gut-liver axis, gut-derived microorganisms and metabolites can be released into the liver, potentially leading to liver injury. In this editorial, we comment on several studies published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Gastroenterology. We focus specifically on the roles of gut microbiota in selected gastrointestinal (GI) diseases that are prevalent, such as inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and hepatitis B virus-related portal hypertension. Over the past few decades, findings from both preclinical and clinical studies have indicated an association between compositional and metabolic changes in the gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of the aforementioned GI disorders. However, studies elucidating the mechanisms underlying the host-microbiota interactions remain limited. The purpose of this editorial is to summarize current findings and provide insights regarding the context-specific roles of gut microbiota. Ultimately, the discovery of microbiome-based biomarkers may facilitate disease diagnosis and the development of personalized medicine.",
