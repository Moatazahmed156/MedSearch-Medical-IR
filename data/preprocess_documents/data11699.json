    "title": "The Application of Nanomaterials in Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide, with the highest incidence and mortality among women. Early precise diagnosis and the development of efficient treatment regimens remain major clinical challenges. Harnessing the programmable size, surface chemistry, and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness of nanomaterials, there is tremendous potential for their applications in breast cancer diagnosis and therapy. In the diagnostic arena, nanomaterials serve as core components of novel contrast agents (e.g., gold nanorods, quantum dots, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) and biosensing platforms, substantially enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of molecular imaging modalities-such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and fluorescence imaging (FLI)-and enabling high-sensitivity detection of circulating tumor cells and tumor-derived exosomes, among various liquid biopsy biomarkers. In therapy, nanoscale carriers (e.g., liposomes, polymeric micelles) improve tumor targeting and accumulation efficiency through passive and active targeting strategies, thereby augmenting anticancer efficacy while effectively reducing systemic toxicity. Furthermore, nanotechnology has spurred the rapid advancement of emerging modalities, including photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and immunotherapy. Notably, the construction of theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic units within a single nanosystem enables in vivo, real-time visualization of drug delivery, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic response feedback, providing a powerful toolkit for advancing breast cancer toward personalized, precision medicine. Despite challenges that remain before clinical translation-such as biocompatibility, scalable manufacturing, and standardized evaluation-nanomaterials are undoubtedly reshaping the paradigm of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.",
