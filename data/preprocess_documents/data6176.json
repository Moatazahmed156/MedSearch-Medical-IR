    "abstract": "Liver steatosis, also called non-alcoholic fatty liver, is characterized by a pathological fat accumulation in the liver, leading to liver damage in the form of inflammation and fibrosis. These histological features are similar to those in alcoholic hepatitis. Obesity is known to be the most common cause of simple steatosis in the preadolescent and adolescent population with a consequent serious health risk. The aim of this study was to provide an update on the concepts, pathophysiology and clinical management of hepatic steatosis secondary to obesity at an early age.",
