    "abstract": "Genomic sequencing of reemerging highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus detected in Argentina in February 2025 revealed novel triple-reassortant viruses containing gene segments from Eurasian H5N1 and low pathogenicity viruses from South and North American lineages. Our findings highlight continued evolution and diversification of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in the Americas.",
