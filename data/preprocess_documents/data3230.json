    "abstract": "Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteropathy (CMUSE) is a rare and exclusive small intestine disease, characterized by repeated anemia or obstruction resulting from multiple shallow ulcers with strictures in the small intestine. We present a case of CMUSE showing multiple foci of activity in the small bowel on FDG PET/CT. This case indicates that CMUSE should be included in the differential diagnosis of multifocal FDG activity in the small bowel along with lymphoma, carcinoma, tuberculosis, Crohn disease, Behçet disease, and drug-induced enteropathy.",
