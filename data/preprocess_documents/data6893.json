    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury, which is a clinical spectrum, requires a thorough evaluation and strict monitoring for clinical deterioration owing to ongoing secondary injury and raised intracranial pressure. Once the intracranial pressure has been treated with maximal medical therapy, surgical decompression is necessary and must be initiated rapidly. Anesthetic management of surgical decompression must balance reduction of the intracranial pressure, maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressures, avoidance of secondary injuries, and optimization of surgical conditions.",
