    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between the platelet-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a hypertensive population, exploring its mediating role in the obesity-CKD association. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2018 on 10,467 hypertensive adults, we observed a complex association. Overall, PHR was positively correlated with CKD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.14). However, the relationship was nonlinear and U-shaped, with an inflection point at a PHR Z-score of -0.32 (PHR = 166). Below this point, the association was negative (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91), whereas above it, the association was strongly positive (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15-1.36), particularly among individuals with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m",
