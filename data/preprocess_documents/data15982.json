The 2- We screened a halogen-enriched fragment library to identify inhibitors of IspE from  Screening identified a fragment-like compound  This newly identified fragment class provides a promising foundation for the development of IspE inhibitors. The findings highlight the utility of fragment-based screening approaches for discovering novel antimicrobial agents targeting the MEP pathway.",
