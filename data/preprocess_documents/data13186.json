A humanized knock-in tauopathy mouse model with FTD-related mutations, MAPT S305N mice were compared to non-mutated MAPT knock-in mice. Mice underwent PET/CT imaging with [ [ PET imaging revealed more rapid tau and synaptic pathologies in female S305Ns despite greater cognitive deficits in male S305N mice. Pathological assessment for neurodegeneration is ongoing. Further characterization of [",
