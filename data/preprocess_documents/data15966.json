    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to pose major global health challenges despite extensive vaccination efforts. Variant escape, waning immunity, and reduced vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised populations underscore the urgent need for complementary antiviral therapeutics. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of precision-engineered dermatan sulfate (DS)-mimetic glycopolymers as multi-targeted inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Guided by molecular docking and virtual screening, sulfation at the C2 and C4 positions of iduronic acid was identified as critical for binding to the viral spike protein and inhibiting host and viral enzymes, including heparanase (HPSE) and main protease (M",
