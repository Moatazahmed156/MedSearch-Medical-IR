    "abstract": "With the development of untargeted metabolomics, studies have shown that alterations in the serum levels of specific amino acids are strongly correlated with the development of early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the relationship between optically active free amino acids in human nails and the risk of CRC remains unclear. In this study, a highly sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS chiral separation method based on (S)-(-)-DBD-Pro-COCl derivatization was established for the simultaneous detection of DL-Asp, DL-Kyn, DL-α-hydroxybutyric acid (DL-α-HB), and Cystamine in the fingernails of patients with CRC. The derivatization reagents were incubated with DL-amino acids, DL-α-HB and Cyst at 60 °C for 15 min to form diastereomers. Subsequently, an Imtakt cadenza CD-C",
