    "abstract": "Investigations on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) events occurring on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are poised to significantly advance nanoliquid biopsy methodologies. This study presented a colorimetric multiplex lateral flow immunoassay strip (mLFIA) for the simultaneous detection of EpCAM and Vimentin, two representative EMT biomarkers, on heterogeneous CTCs. The assay utilized an engineered magnetic probe (pCF-Apt-H1/H2), characterized by a zwitterionic polymer coating on Fe",
