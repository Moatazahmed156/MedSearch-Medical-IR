    "abstract": "Myocardial activities of several enzymes were measured in infarcted and non-infarcted areas of heart sections obtained from eight patients who died after acute myocardial infarction. Similar data were obtained from four patients with cardiovascular disorders who died from causes other than myocardial infarction and from six patients without previously known heart disease. It was found that both non-infarcted and infarcted tissue samples contained considerably altered enzyme activities. This finding explains the low correlations between enzymatic and histological estimates of infarct size previously reported. However, when the residual myocardial activities of different enzymes were compared with each other, a close correlation was found between creatine kinase, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase. It appears that the pathological changes in the myocardial activities of these enzymes may be explained by the phenomenon of diluted myocardium. This indicates that myocardial injury, as estimated from plasma enzyme activities, may still be expressed meaningfully in gram equivalents of healthy myocardium.",
