    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition marked by significant motor impairments, resulting from extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons and abnormal protein aggregation. One of the early features of PD is disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, which arises from imbalances in cellular energy regulation. Therapeutic strategies that mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance mitochondrial performance offer neuroprotection in PD. To delve into the role of mitochondrial function, we employed the synthetic PGC-1α activator ZLN005 to improve PD outcomes. In cellular PD model, we performed western blotting and immunofluorescence assays to assess disease-specific markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase and proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation. Mitochondrial function was further evaluated using MitoTracker and ROS detection. We further investigated ZLN005 in a sub-acute MPTP mouse model. Motor performance was assessed, and subsequently, molecular analyses were conducted. Our findings revealed that ZLN005 significantly reduced MPP",
