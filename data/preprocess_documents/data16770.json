    "title": "Multisensory Rhythmic Entrainment as a Mechanistic Framework for Modulating Prefrontal Network Stability in Focal Epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "Epilepsy is increasingly conceptualized as a disorder of large-scale network instability, involving impairments in interhemispheric connectivity, prefrontal inhibitory control, and slow-frequency temporal processing. Rhythmic sensory stimulation-auditory, vibrotactile, or multisensory-can entrain neuronal oscillations and modulate attentional and sensorimotor networks, yet its mechanistic relevance to epileptic network physiology remains insufficiently explored. This conceptual and mechanistic article integrates empirical findings from entrainment research, prefrontal timing theories, multisensory integration, and network-based models of seizure dynamics and uses them to formulate a hypothesis-driven framework for multisensory exogenous rhythmic stimulation (ERS) in focal epilepsy. Rather than presenting a tested intervention, we propose a set of speculative mechanistic pathways through which low-frequency rhythmic cues might serve as an external temporal reference, engage fronto-parietal control systems, facilitate multisensory-driven sensorimotor coupling, and potentially modulate interhemispheric frontal coherence. These putative mechanisms are illustrated by exploratory neurophysiological observations, including a small pilot study reporting frontal coherence changes during mobile ERS exposure, but they have not yet been validated in controlled experimental settings. The framework does not imply therapeutic benefit; instead, it identifies theoretical pathways through which rhythmic sensory cues may transiently interact with epileptic networks. The proposed model is intended as a conceptual foundation for future neurophysiological validation, computational simulations, and early feasibility research in the emerging field of digital neuromodulation, rather than as evidence of clinical efficacy. This Hypothesis article formulates explicitly testable predictions regarding how multisensory ERS may transiently modulate candidate physiological markers of prefrontal network stability in focal epilepsy.",
