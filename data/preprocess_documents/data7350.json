    "abstract": "Stem cell therapy holds immense potential as a viable treatment for a widespread range of intractable disorders. As the safety of stem cell transplantation having been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials, various kinds of stem cells are currently utilized in medical applications. Despite the achievements, the therapeutic benefits of stem cells for diseases are limited, and the data of clinical researches are unstable. To optimize tthe effectiveness of stem cells, engineering approaches have been developed to enhance their inherent abilities and impart them with new functionalities, paving the way for the next generation of stem cell therapies. This review offers a detailed analysis of engineered stem cells, including their clinical applications and potential for future development. We begin by briefly introducing the recent advances in the production of stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)). Furthermore, we present the latest developments of engineered strategies in stem cells, including engineered methods in molecular biology and biomaterial fields, and their application in biomedical research. Finally, we summarize the current obstacles and suggest future prospects for engineered stem cells in clinical translations and biomedical applications.",
