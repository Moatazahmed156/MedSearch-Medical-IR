    "abstract": "Herpes zoster is a disease caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that has been latently infecting the body and is more common among the elderly. In Japan, the incidence of herpes zoster has been increasing steadily and is expected to increase further in the future. In 2016, the varicella vaccine was expanded to include prevention of herpes zoster, and a new subunit vaccine was also launched in 2020. In recent years, anti-herpesvirus drugs with novel pharmacological effects have also been introduced, and the environment surrounding the treatment of herpes zoster is entering a new era.",
