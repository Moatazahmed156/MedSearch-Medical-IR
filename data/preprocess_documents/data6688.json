We here present a simple technique for thoracoscopic localization of small parasternal lymph nodes using echo-guided injection of indocyanine green. This technique rapidly marks the whole chain of enhanced lymph nodes for radical resection, enabling accurate endoscopic resection of small parasternal lymph nodes.",
