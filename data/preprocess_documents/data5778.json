    "abstract": "There is growing basic and clinical evidence that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with gut microbiome alterations, but clinical studies have tended not to adjust for confounding factors. And few studies on the gut microbiome focused on young adults with MDD. Here we performed a pilot study to compare the gut microbiome of young adults with MDD with healthy controls. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on stool samples obtained from 40 young adults with MDD and 42 healthy controls. After controlling for confounding factors including sex, age, BMI, alcohol or cigarette consumption, bowel movement quality, exercise or defecation frequency, we compared microbiome diversity between groups, identified differentially abundant taxa, and further compared functional differences through gut-brain and gut-metabolic module analysis. There were no significant differences in overall gut microbiome structure and function in young adults with MDD compared with controls. Abundance of Sutterellaceae and species belonging to Clostridium, Eubacterium, and Ruminococcus were significantly different between groups. The cysteine degradation I pathway was increased in MDD. After controlling for most confounding factors, this pilot study provides new evidence on the specific, often subtle gut dysbiosis affecting young adults with depression.",
