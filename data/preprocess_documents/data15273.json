    "title": "Diagnostic Dilemma in Carpet-like Tuberculoma.",
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a major global health challenge, and central nervous system involvement, though uncommon, can manifest as intracranial tuberculoma. We report a rare case of a 67-year-old woman with no prior tuberculosis history who presented with progressive left leg mobility issues and speech difficulties over 2 weeks. Neurological MRI revealed a distinctive dura-adherent lesion resembling a \"carpet.\" As her condition deteriorated, total resection was performed, with pathologic examination confirming tuberculoma. Following 1 week of recovery, the patient was transferred for anti-tubercular therapy. This case is notable not only for its unusual dural attachment and carpet-like morphology but also for its occurrence in an elderly female, making it an exceptionally rare clinical entity.",
