    "abstract": "The field of prostate cancer research is poised for dramatic improvements in our ability to better diagnose men at risk of prostate cancer and to better predict prognosis and response to treatment. Histopathologic and molecular analyses lie at the heart of these issues. Improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis and in determining why the prostate seems to be so highly targeted for cancer development will lead to rational strategies of disease prevention.",
