    "abstract": "Considerable evidence shows that oxidative stress exists in the pathophysiological process of female reproductive system diseases. At present, there have been many studies on oxidative stress of placenta during pregnancy, especially for preeclampsia. However, studies that directly focus on the effects of oxidative stress on blood vessels at the maternal-fetal interface and their associated possible outcomes are still incomplete and ambiguous. To provide an option for early clinical prediction and therapeutic application of oxidative stress in female reproductive system diseases, this paper briefly describes the composition of the maternal-fetal interface and the molecular mediators produced by oxidative stress, focuses on the sources of oxidative stress and the signaling pathways of oxidative stress at the maternal-fetal interface, expounds the adverse consequences of oxidative stress on blood vessels, and deeply discusses the relationship between oxidative stress and some pregnancy complications and other female reproductive system diseases.",
