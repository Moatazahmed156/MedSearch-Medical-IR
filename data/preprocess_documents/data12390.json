In this study, a series of new 1,2,4-triazole-chalcone derivatives were designed and synthesized, and the against HCT-116 cells (colon cancer) and A549 cells (lung cancer) proliferative activity of the target compounds was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Among them, the representative compound 11g showed the most antitumor activity with IC",
