    "abstract": "While many Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are investigated in solid tumors, their target expression and heterogeneity is poorly documented in metastatic breast cancer. Here, we perform RNA sequencing to investigate expression of 72 ADC targets in 909 samples from 30 female patients from our post-mortem tissue donation program UPTIDER (NCT04531696). We report that the highest median expression in metastases is seen for FN1, MUC1, LAMP1, HER3 and SLC39A6. TROP2 and HER2 have the 9",
