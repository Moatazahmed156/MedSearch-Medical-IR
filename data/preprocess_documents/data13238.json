    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently complicated by dysphagia, undermining timely and reliable oral dopaminergic medication. Levodopa's short half-life and delayed gastric emptying in advanced PD result in inconsistent absorption, delayed \"ON\" periods, and challenges to adherence. Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) dissolve without water and can mitigate swallowing limitations. Research indicates that selegiline ODT achieves a faster time to peak and higher relative bioavailability via partial buccal absorption, whereas carbidopa/levodopa ODTs are bioequivalent to immediate release tablets (with similar AUC/C",
