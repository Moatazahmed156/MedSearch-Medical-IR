    "abstract": "Breast cancer, a malignant tumor with a high incidence in women, lacks in vitro research models that can represent the biological functions of breast tumors in vivo . As a new biological tool, the organoid model has unique advantages over traditional methods, such as cell culture and patient-derived xenografts. Combining organoids with other emerging technologies, such as gene engineering and microfluidic chip technology, provides an effective method to compensate for the deficiencies in organoid models of breast cancer in vivo . The emergence of breast cancer organoids has provided new tools and research directions in precision medicine, and drug research. In this review, we summarized the merits and demerits of organoids compared to traditional biological models, explored the latest developments in the combination of new technologies and organoid models, and discussed the construction methods and application prospects of different breast cancer organoid models.",
