    "abstract": "Clopidogrel-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare but significant adverse effect. Herein, we report a case of organizing pneumonia following clopidogrel administration, confirmed by histopathology and accidental re-administration, fulfilling Camus's criteria for drug-induced ILD. The patient responded well to corticosteroid therapy. A systematic literature review identified nine additional cases, with clinical presentations ranging from ground-glass opacities to eosinophilic infiltration. Most cases involved immune-mediated mechanisms. This report highlights the diagnostic challenges of clopidogrel-induced ILD and underscores the importance of considering drug etiology in organizing pneumonia.",
