    "abstract": "Pediatric traumatic brain injury is a challenge to critical care practitioners. The prevention of secondary injury is key to improving morbidity and mortality outcomes. Interventions are targeted at maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow and minimizing oxygen consumption by the brain. The anticipation and prevention of systemic complications are also of vital importance. The impact that nursing judgment has on outcomes is notable. Pediatric traumatic brain injury is described, current treatments and issues are discussed, and an overview of outcomes related to morbidity are presented.",
