    "abstract": "Ex vivo working porcine heart models allow for the study of a heart's function and physiology outside the living organism. These models are particularly useful due to the anatomical and physiological similarities between porcine and human hearts, providing an experimental platform to investigate cardiac disease or assess donor heart viability for transplantation. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion of the model's components, including the perfusate, preload, and afterload. We explore the challenges of emulating cardiac afterload and present a historical perspective on afterload modeling, discussing various methodologies and their respective limitations. An actively controlled afterload device is introduced to enhance the model's ability to rapidly adjust pressure in the large arteries, thereby providing a more accurate and dynamic experimental model. Finally, we provide a comprehensive experimental protocol for the ex vivo working porcine heart model.",
