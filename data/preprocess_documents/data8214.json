    "abstract": "A wounded patient can be presented to the veterinary surgeon under a number of circumstances. The wound could result from external trauma,such as vehicle trauma or an animal fight, or it could have been created by surgical intervention, such as the removal of a mass. A wound could also be secondary to a failed initial attempt at wound closure. No matter what the cause, initial wound management often follows similar pathways. A successful wound closure and healing outcome is often dependent on adherence to basic principles of wound assessment, appropriate care, and reassessment. This article covers the approach to and specific options for the initial stages of wound management.",
