    "abstract": "Due to the size and location within the pediatric patient, the kidneys are susceptible to injury from blunt trauma. While it is clear that the goal of management of blunt renal trauma in children is renal preservation, the methods of achieving this goal have not been well established in the current literature. Therefore, we have set out to summarize and clarify the current published information on the management strategies for blunt renal trauma in children. While there is extensive literature available, it consists mostly of retrospective series documenting widely varied management styles. The purpose of this review is to display the current information available and delineate the role for future studies that may allow us to develop consistent management strategies of pediatric patients, who have sustained blunt renal trauma, in a safe and cost-effective manner.",
