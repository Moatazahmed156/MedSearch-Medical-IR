    "abstract": "The results of endofiberscopic removal of traumatic intracranial haematomas and hygromas in 180 patients are analysed. Peculiarities of the surgical techniques using flexiscopes and original devices in epidural, subdural, intracerebral, intraventricular haemorrhages of various consistencies, size and location are reported. A technique of the trephination access and delayed cranioplasty for endoscopic removal of extensive subdural and intracerebral haematomas is presented. Indications, contra-indications for endoscopic haematoma surgery, advantages, disadvantages, failures of the techniques are discussed.",
