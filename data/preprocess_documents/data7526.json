    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Breast cancer is the most predominant and heterogeneous cancer in women. Moreover, breast cancer has a high prevalence to metastasize to distant organs, such as the brain, lungs, and bones. Patients with breast cancer metastasis to the bones have poor overall and relapse-free survival. Moreover, treatment using chemotherapy and immunotherapy is ineffective in preventing or reducing cancer metastasis.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Microorganisms residing in the gut and breast, termed as the resident microbiome, have a significant influence on the formation and progression of breast cancer. Recent studies have identified some microorganisms that induce breast cancer metastasis to the bone. These organisms utilize multiple mechanisms, including induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, steroid hormone metabolism, immune modification, bone remodeling, and secretion of microbial products that alter tumor microenvironment, and enhance propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize. However, their involvement makes these microorganisms suitable as novel therapeutic targets. Thus, studies are underway to prevent and reduce breast cancer metastasis to distant organs, including the bone, using chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic drugs, along with probiotics, antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The present review describes association of gut and breast microbiomes with bone metastases. We have elaborated on the mechanisms utilized by breast and gut microbiomes that induce breast cancer metastasis, especially to the bone. The review also highlights the current treatment options that may target both the microbiomes for preventing or reducing breast cancer metastases. Finally, we have specified the necessity of maintaining a diverse gut microbiome to prevent dysbiosis, which otherwise may induce breast carcinogenesis and metastasis especially to the bone. The review may facilitate more detailed investigations of the causal associations between these microbiomes and bone metastases. Moreover, the potential treatment options described in the review may promote discussions and research on the modes to improve survival of patients with breast cancer by targeting the gut and breast microbiomes.",
