    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with complex behavioral symptoms that can arise in the absence of overt structural brain damage. Recent evidence suggests that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) located at the brain's interfaces regulate central nervous system function, yet the specific roles of distinct BAM subsets remain largely undefined. By reanalyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem PD brains, we identified a BAM subset expressing CD169 that was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. To examine their function, we employed CD169-DTR mice to selectively ablate CD169",
