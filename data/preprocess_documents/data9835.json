    "title": "Nature's Cardioprotective Sweetness: A Review of Dates as Functional Food in Hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Dates contain numerous beneficial nutrients and bioactive compounds, including potassium, magnesium, dietary fiber, polyphenols, flavonoids, and essential fatty acids, which contribute to their antihypertensive effects. Mechanistically, these bioactives reduce oxidative stress, lower inflammation, enhance endothelial function through increased nitric oxide bioavailability, and modulate the renin-angiotensin system. Clinical studies demonstrate that regular, moderate consumption of dates can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and positively regulate inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers without adverse metabolic or glycemic outcomes. Despite promising findings, variability in date cultivars, ripening stages, and limited standardized human trials necessitate further research. Larger, randomized clinical studies across diverse demographics are recommended to establish optimal dosage, confirm mechanisms of action, and assess long-term safety and effectiveness. This review investigates the potential of dates (",
