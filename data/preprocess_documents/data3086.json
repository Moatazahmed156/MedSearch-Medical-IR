    "abstract": "The sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most popular weight loss procedure in the USA. Despite its popularity, little is definitively known about the variables that correlate with weight loss. We performed a literature search to find studies that reported variables that correlated with weight loss following SG. Forty-eight articles were identified and included. These articles covered 36 different factors predictive of weight loss while only including five predictive models. Only 12.5% of multivariate analyses evaluated sufficiently reported their results. The factors that predict weight loss following SG cannot be concluded due to the inconsistency in reporting and the methodological flaws in analysis. Reporting factors that predict weight loss should be standardized, and methods should be changed to allow physicians to use the data presented.",
