    "title": "Patients and Surfaces: Integrated Clinical-Environmental Surveillance of MDR Gram-Negative Bacteria in Critical-Care Units (Karachi, 2024-2025).",
    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CR-GN) pathogens pose a critical threat to patient outcomes in high-dependency and intensive care environments. This study aimed to delineate species prevalence, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, carbapenemase genotypes, and clinical-environmental transmission dynamics across critical-care units. Cross-sectional surveillance was conducted in six ICUs and HDUs of a tertiary-care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. We identified predominant species, quantified resistance patterns, and detected carbapenemase genes using PCR, exclusively on meropenem-resistant isolates. Network analysis highlighted high-centrality contamination hubs across ICUs and HDUs. ",
