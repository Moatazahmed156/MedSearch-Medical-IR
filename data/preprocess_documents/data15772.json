    "abstract": "Since COVID-19 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is essential to longitudinally monitor functional capacity and pulmonary function in individuals with post-COVID syndrome (PCS). This study aimed to evaluate the functional capacity of individuals with PCS during exercise using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) and examine its association with spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), and lung ultrasound (LUS) parameters. Sixty individuals participated in this study. We assessed CPX, which measured peak oxygen consumption (VO The mean VO Patients with PCS undergoing CPX demonstrated impaired functional capacity. In these individuals, higher age and BMI were associated with lower VO",
