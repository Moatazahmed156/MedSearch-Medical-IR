    "abstract": "Genotypic characteristics may determine the body's response to stressful conditions as well as its susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Old age worsens the course of these diseases, and often concomitant hypertension can negatively affect brain function, especially in cases of social isolation. In this work, we studied how social isolation and hypertension affect the transcription activity of genes associated with glucocorticoid signaling in the rat brain. The study was performed on 10-month-old rats of the outbred Wistar stock (",
