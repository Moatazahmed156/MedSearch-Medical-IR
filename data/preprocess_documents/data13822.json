    "title": "Hydroxychloroquine Ocular Toxicity - A Comprehensive Review.",
    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine is a pharmacological agent in the management of various rheumatological disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Its therapeutic effects are attributed to its immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties, and it is widely used due to its efficacy, relatively low cost, and generally favorable safety profile. Despite its well-established clinical utility, chronic use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with serious ocular side effects. This review covers hydroxychloroquine's history, pharmacokinetics and ocular safety profile, with a focus on the risk, diagnosis and screening for ocular toxicity. Retinopathy, the most significant adverse ocular side effect, may lead to irreversible vision loss if not promptly detected.",
