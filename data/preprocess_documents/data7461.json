    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a disease that has a 1 in 8 lifetime risk for women, making it an international burden. Although breast cancer mostly affects women, men have a lifetime risk of around 1 in 1000. The majority of breast cancer instances continue linked to breast cancers that have acquired somatic mutations during a person's lifespan. The mutations that are in the situation do not cluster in families and are not inherited. The particular genetic variables involved in hereditary breast cancer will define a cancer risk due to genetics. Despite fact, Cadherin-1(CDH1), Phosphatase and TENsin (PTEN), Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11), Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) genes have mutations, a BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) and BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2) genes, documented to inherit significantly increase a chance of developing BRCA. Recognizing the functional importance of genetic mutations has created avenues to prevent breast cancer and is revealing promising therapeutic approaches.",
