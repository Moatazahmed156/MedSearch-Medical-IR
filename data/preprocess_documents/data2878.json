    "abstract": "Performing a comprehensive physical examination of the head and neck (H&N) is an essential skill for the hospitalist/internist. The structures of the H&N are anatomically and functionally complex. Importantly, this physical examination requires certain instrumentation for adequate examination. The main goal of the physical examination is to narrow the differential diagnosis created based on the patient's history. When performed in a methodical manner, the H&N physical examination can enhance a clinician's diagnostic accuracy, facilitate early disease detection, and optimize patient-care.",
