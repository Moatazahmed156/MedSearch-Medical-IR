    "abstract": "Switching diesel buses (DBs) to electric buses (EBs) has been a global trend to reduce the use of fossil fuels and improve air quality. However, buses electrification may lead to additional vehicle weight, which may emit more non-exhaust particulate matter (PM) emissions. It remains debatable whether buses' electrification will successfully improve air quality as excepted. To assess the effect of the buses' electrification on the levels of PM emissions, PM emission factors (EFs) were evaluated from EBs and equivalent DBs. In addition, the total mass of PM emissions from EBs and equivalent DBs in 2021 was calculated in Xi'an using the real-world number and mileage of EBs. The non-exhaust PM EFs from EBs were larger than total exhaust and non-exhaust PM EFs from DBs, indicating that the electrification of buses would cause an increase in the level of PM emissions. The total annual mass of PM emissions from EBs was apparently higher than that from DBs. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that tire wear, brake wear, and road wear PM emissions were more reliant on vehicle mileage, whereas resuspension of road dust was more dependent on vehicle weight. This finding can serve as a guideline for policymakers to design mitigation strategies for reducing extra PM emissions due to the electrification of buses by reasonably reducing vehicle weight and annual mileage.",
