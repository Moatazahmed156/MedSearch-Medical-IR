    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Chronic infection and inflammation have been linked to the development of prostate cancer. Dysbiosis of the oral and gut microbiomes and subsequent microbial translocation can lead to pathogenic prostate infections. Microbial-produced metabolites have also been associated with signaling pathways that promote prostate cancer development. A comprehensive discussion on the mechanisms of microbiome infection and the prostate microenvironment is essential to understand prostate carcinogenesis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Published studies were used from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to conduct a narrative review. No restrictions were applied in the selection of articles.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been found to upregulate multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K, through IGF-1 signaling and M2 macrophage polarization. SCFAs can also upregulate Toll-like receptors, leading to chronic inflammation and the creation of a pro-prostate cancer environment. Dysbiosis of oral microbiota has been correlated with prostate infection and inflammation. Additionally, pathogenic microbiomes associated with urinary tract infections have shown a link to prostate cancer, with vesicoureteral reflux potentially contributing to prostate infection.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This review offers a comprehensive understanding of the impact of microbial infections linked to intraprostatic inflammation as a causative factor for prostate cancer. Further studies involving the manipulation of the microbiome and its produced metabolites may provide a more complete understanding of the microenvironmental mechanisms that promote prostate carcinogenesis.",
