    "abstract": "There is a lack of information regarding the oral health of the elderly population in Romania; only a few articles have been published about their edentulism, and there are no official data regarding the oral health, OHRQoL, and prosthodontic status of this population. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the essential functional qualities of removable partial dentures (RPD) and participants' oral-health-related wellbeing among an edentulous population from the N-E region in Romania using the OHIP-5-questionnaire. In total, 546 patients from Gr. T. Popa Iasi University were enrolled after following a set of sorting procedures. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test to determine whether there were significant differences between the various groups of patients. For questions 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the OHIP, the null hypothesis was rejected, as there were statistically significant differences between the three groups. This study was limited to a specific group. However, it can provide an insight into RPD patients' happiness when treated in an academic environment.",
