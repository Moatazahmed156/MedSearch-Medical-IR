    "abstract": "Organoid technology, characterized by high fidelity in mimicking the in vivo microenvironment, preservation of tumor heterogeneity, and capacity for high-throughput operations, has emerged as a critical tool in head and neck cancer research. To address clinical challenges in head and neck cancer management-including marked tumor heterogeneity, therapeutic resistance, and significant prognostic variability-this review focuses on four key translational applications of organoid technology: In mechanistic studies, organoid models provide a reliable platform for investigating tumorigenesis, progression, and drug resistance mechanisms. In personalized therapy, organoid-based drug sensitivity testing enables data-driven clinical decision-making. For biomarker discovery, organoids facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. With ongoing improvements and standardization of organoid culture systems, this technology holds substantial promise for advancing precision medicine in head and neck cancer, bridging the gap between basic research and clinical practice.",
