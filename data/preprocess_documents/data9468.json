    "title": "Mechanistic study of plastic monomers in gestational diabetes mellitus: A network toxicology and molecular docking approach.",
    "abstract": "Plastics are widely used in various fields such as food packaging, textile fibers, building materials, and transportation. Although the relationship between plastic additives and diseases has been reported, there is limited research on the association between plastic monomers (PM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aims to investigate the link between environmental PM and GDM. By employing advanced network toxicology and molecular docking techniques, we successfully elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which PM may induce GDM. Utilizing databases such as PubChem, SEA, Super-PRED, SwissTargetPrediction, PharmMapper, Gene Cards, and OMIM, we identified potential targets associated with the disease. Further analysis using STRING and Cytoscape software helped determine the core targets most significantly related to these metabolic disorders. Additionally, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the David database to characterize these core targets. Finally, molecular docking with CB-Dock2 was used to validate the binding affinity of PM to these target proteins. Our findings suggest that PM may potentially induce GDM by modulating the insulin signaling pathway through STAT3, AKT1, and TP53. In summary, this work provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which environmental pollutants may trigger GDM, thereby laying a theoretical foundation for disease prevention and treatment. It offers valuable references for the safety evaluation of plastics, urging food safety regulatory agencies to strengthen oversight and encouraging the public to reduce plastic usage.",
