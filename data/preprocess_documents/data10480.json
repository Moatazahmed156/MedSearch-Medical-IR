    "abstract": "Asthma is a prevalent chronic condition in children, often associated with significant psychosocial comorbidities. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and predictors of depression and anxiety among asthmatic children. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2023 National Survey of Children's Health, involving 55,162 completed surveys representing a cohort of 133,963 U.S. children. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess predictors of depression and anxiety among asthmatic children. Asthmatic children had higher rates of depression (9.4 vs. 3.2% in nonasthmatics,  Asthma is associated with a higher psychosocial burden. The identified factors, particularly poorer health status and frequent health care utilization, highlight the vulnerable subgroups and emphasize the need for integrated care approaches, including mental health screening and support for asthmatic children.",
