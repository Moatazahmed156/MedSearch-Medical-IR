    "abstract": "Lymph node dissection is an integral part of the surgical resection of colon cancers; it completes the wide regional resection of tumor and it allows prognostic evaluation through accurate staging. Studies have demonstrated an immune reaction to the tumoral site which attests to an ongoing dialog between the tumor and systemic defenses. The regional lymph nodes constitute an important first line of immune defense where initial host response is initiated or, inversely, they may participate in a local state of immunosuppression. This article reviews current knowledge on intra-tumoral and nodal immune status in colorectal cancers and attempts to evaluate the potential immunologic implications of lymph node dissection.",
