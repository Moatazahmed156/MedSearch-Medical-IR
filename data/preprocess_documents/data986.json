    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene. FMR1 is an RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system. Recent studies in Drosophila indicate that FMR1 plays an important role in synaptogenesis and axonal arborization, which may underlie the observed deficits in flight ability and circadian behavior of fmr1 mutant flies. The relevance of these studies to our understanding of fragile X syndrome is discussed.",
