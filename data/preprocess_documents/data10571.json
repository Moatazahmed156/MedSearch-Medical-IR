    "abstract": "To explore the efficacy of synergistic nursing and flexible play-based mode in children with bronchial asthma. The clinical data of 120 children with bronchial asthma, treated in Children's Hospital of Hebei Province from February 2023 to April 2025, were retrospectively selected. Based on the nursing approach, patients were divided into the control (routine nursing) and the study group (synergistic nursing and flexible play-based mode in addition to the routine nursing). The recovery RATE, negative emotions before and after intervention (assessed using Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders [SCARED] and Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children [DSRSC], quality of life (assessed by Asthma Quality of Life questionnaire [AQLQ]) and nursing satisfaction of the family members were compared. The duration of wheezing, the disappearance of cough episodes and the hospitalization time were significantly shorter in the study group than in the control group (P<0.05). After intervention, the SCARED and DSRSC scores in the two groups were considerably lower than before intervention (P<0.05). The scores of emotional function, restricted activity, environmental irritation and symptoms in the two groups after intervention were higher than preintervention and markedly higher in the study group compared to the control group (P<0.05). The nursing satisfaction of the family members of the study group (95.24%) was higher than that of the control group (82.46%) and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Synergistic nursing and flexible play-based mode in children with bronchial asthma can shorten the time of symptom relief, alleviate negative emotions, improve the quality of life, promote the early recovery and discharge of children and is associated with higher family satisfaction levels.",
