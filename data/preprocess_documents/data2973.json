    "abstract": "Disruption of water and electrolyte balance is frequently encountered in clinical medicine. Regulating water metabolism is critically important. Diabetes insipidus (DI) presented with excessive water loss from the kidney is a major disorder of water metabolism. To understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms and pathophysiology of DI and rationales of clinical management of DI is important for both research and clinical practice. This chapter will first review various forms of DI focusing on central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). This is followed by a discussion of regulatory mechanisms underlying CDI and NDI, with a focus on the regulatory axis of vasopressin, vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) and the water channel molecule, aquaporin 2 (AQP2). The clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and management of various forms of DI will also be discussed with highlights of some of the latest therapeutic strategies that are developed from in vitro experiments and animal studies.",
