    "abstract": "Methylation of CpG islands plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. The study of DNA methylation profiles offers deep insights into key oncogenic processes and facilitates the differentiation of tumor entities at the epigenetic level. Methylation profiling was performed on 8 CNS tumors (6 children, 1 adolescent, 1 young adult) with inconclusive diagnoses, available frozen tissue, and surgeries dating back over 5 years. Our goal was to correlate the resulting methylation classes with the clinical-radiological data and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic power of this analysis. The resulting molecularly defined diagnoses were: pilocytic astrocytoma (3 cases), pilocytic astrocytoma subclass ",
