    "abstract": "Traditionally, the stomach was believed to be a sterile organ unsuitable for microbiota growth. However, the discovery of H. pylori subverted this conception. With the development of molecular techniques, an abundance of microbiota of great diversity was found in the stomach. In addition, various lines of evidence suggest that the gastric microbiota plays a critical role in the development and progression of the gastric disease.The gastrointestinal microbiome plays an important role in various physiologic and pathologic processes.",
