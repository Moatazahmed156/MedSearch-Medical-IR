    "abstract": "Despite considerable progress over the last decades, acute myocardial infarction continues to remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present therapies include only cause-dependent interventions, which are not able to reduce myocardial necrosis and optimize cardiac repair following infarction. This review highlights the cellular and molecular processes after myocardial injury and focuses on chemokines, the main modulators of the inflammatory and reparatory events, as the most valuable drug targets.",
