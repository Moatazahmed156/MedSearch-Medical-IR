    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive form of cancer. Previously, surgery was rarely considered because most patients present at the advanced stages of the disease. New research and the advances in medical imaging has challenged this notion proving that, as part of a multimodal treatment pathway, surgery has a key role to play in the management of patients with early small cell lung cancer. In this chapter, we present the most pertinent research that has shaped clinical practice and outline the current treatment algorithm for small cell lung cancer.",
