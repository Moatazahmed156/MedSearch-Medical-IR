    "abstract": "Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is an evidence-supported, relationally focused treatment for people living with depression and other psychiatric disorders in the context of stressful life events. Mentalizing, also relationally focused, promotes the ability to perceive, understand, and interpret human behavior in terms of intentional mental states of others or oneself, in order to support social leaning. IPT and mentalization-based treatments (MBT) both seek to improve interpersonal effectiveness, albeit with different emphases in the therapeutic process, with IPT promoting interpersonal problem solving and MBT promoting understanding of the obstacles to this outcome. In this article, the authors propose that the central intentions of IPT and mentalizing are essentially linked and complementary; understanding others and oneself in relationships facilitates interpersonal problem resolution and symptomatic recovery and enhances resilience. The clinical synergies of IPT and mentalizing are elaborated and illustrated through a case example of treatment for a socially isolated woman with depression and interpersonal sensitivities.",
