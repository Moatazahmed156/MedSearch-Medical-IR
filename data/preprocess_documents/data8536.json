    "abstract": "Wounds are a commonly encountered and complex entity in healthcare, and often require multidisciplinary involvement for their management. Wound care and healing are affected by a range of factors of which nutrition, a modifiable factor, plays an integral part. Familiarity with the phases of wound healing and the differing nutritional requirements at each stage is fundamental to managing wounds. Additionally, awareness of the signs of malnutrition, screening tools and educational resources for managing malnutrition in primary care settings are all vital to minimising malnutrition and its adverse effects on wound healing. This article reviews the phases of wound healing and the associated nutritional requirements required for optimal healing, the clinical signs of malnutrition and screening resources for identifying at-risk groups, as well as reviewing current guidelines for managing malnutrition in the inpatient and outpatient setting.",
