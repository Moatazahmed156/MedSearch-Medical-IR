    "abstract": "RASSF2 is a tumor suppressor gene closely related to gastric cancer. This meta-analysis was designed to assess the quality in the previous studies and establish the value of RASSF2 methylation in the prediction and prognosis of gastric cancer. The eligible literatures with publication deadline of May 3, 2019 were collected from PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang, and CNVIP databases. The correlation between RASSF2 methylation level and gastric cancer was estimated by odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR and 95% CI) values. A total of eight articles were included in the study. A total of 517 gastric cancer tissue samples and 517 adjacent nontumor tissue samples were included. The results of the analysis showed that RASSF2 had a significantly higher level of methylation in gastric cancer (OR = 17.56, 95% CI = 7.11-43.35, p-value = 0.009). Meanwhile, we tested whether there was association of RASSF2 methylation with tumor metastasis, and we also analyzed whether there was a gender difference in RASSF2 methylation. However, our results showed no statistical significance of the two aforementioned tests (p > 0.1). Our study suggested that RASSF2 methylation could predict the risk of gastric cancer. However, it might not be feasible for the prediction of tumor metastasis.",
