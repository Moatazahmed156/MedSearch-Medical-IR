    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality. Modifiable lifestyle factors, including avoidance of tobacco use and excessive ultraviolet radiation, healthy dietary patterns, regular physical activity, and weight management, play key roles in prevention and care. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on lifestyle-based interventions influencing cancer risk, treatment tolerance, and survivorship. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, supplemented by manual screening via Google Scholar. The time frame (2001-2025) was selected to reflect evidence produced within the modern era of molecular oncology and contemporary lifestyle medicine research. Eligible publications addressed carcinogen exposure (tobacco, alcohol, ultraviolet radiation), diet and nutritional strategies, physical activity, sedentary behavior, obesity, metabolic health, complementary therapies, and cancer outcomes. Evidence indicates that reducing exposure to tobacco and ultraviolet radiation remains central to cancer prevention. Adherence to predominantly plant-based diets, regular physical activity, and maintenance of healthy body weight are consistently associated with lower incidence of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and liver cancer. Nutritional strategies such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diets, and fasting-mimicking diets show promise in improving treatment efficacy and quality of life. Complementary and mind-body therapies may alleviate treatment-related symptoms, although high-quality evidence on long-term safety and effectiveness is limited. Integrating lifestyle medicine into oncology offers a cost-effective, sustainable strategy to reduce cancer burden and enhance survivorship. Comprehensive programs combining carcinogen avoidance, dietary regulation, structured exercise, and effective radiation risk mitigation may extend healthspan, improve treatment tolerance, and help prevent recurrence.",
