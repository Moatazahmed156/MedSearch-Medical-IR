    "abstract": "Marginal zone lymphomas represent approximately 10-12% of all B-cell lymphomas. Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (EMZL) or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are the most common subtype. Almost half of all MALT lymphomas arise in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and, while the stomach is the most common site of GI involvement, the small and large intestines can also be involved. Rare cases of MALT lymphoma involving the rectum have been reported; however, to our knowledge, involvement of the anal canal has never been reported in the literature. Here, we describe a unique case of MALT lymphoma of the anal canal. Infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas, possibly through persistent antigenic stimulation of the area; however, in our case no such infection was documented.",
