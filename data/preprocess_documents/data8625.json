    "abstract": "Wound healing is a well-orchestrated process, where numerous factors are activated or inhibited in a sequence of steps. Immediately after the infliction of damage, the repair of wound stars. The initial step is an inflammatory change with activation of innate immunity, which is followed by proliferation phase, including fibroplasia, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. Pathological impairment of wound healing process may lead to persistent ulceration as seen in diabetic patients. Various signaling pathways are involved in wound healing. TGFβ/Smad pathway is a representative and well known to participate in fibroplasia, however, its comprehensive effect on wound healing is controversial. Experimental and clinical remedies have been being tried to promote wound healing. Advancement of cell engineering allows us to use stem cells and living skin equivalents.",
