    "title": "Comprehensive Zonal Assessment of Meniscal Degeneration Using Quantitative UTE MRI.",
    "abstract": "Knee menisci consist of three zones-red-red (RR), red-white (RW), and white-white (WW) zones, which may be differentially affected by osteoarthritis (OA). Zone-specific quantitative imaging techniques are valuable in understanding OA progression. The study utilized a comprehensive set of ultrashort-echo-time (UTE) MRI sequences, including UTE-T Sixty-two volunteers (mean-age 55±17 years; 30 females; 46 patients with radiographic OA) participated in the study. UTE techniques were employed to quantify T A total of 178 meniscal regions were analyzed, with 65 classified as grade-1 (normal), 80 as grade-2 (mild-degeneration), and 33 as grade-3 (advanced-degeneration). Significant differences in all UTE measurements were clearly observed between the three zones in normal menisci. These differences became less distinct with increasing degeneration. Furthermore, within each zone, T The study highlights the potential of UTE measurements to differentiate normal meniscal zonal composition and detect early changes due to degeneration, offering a promising tool for comprehensive knee-OA assessment and treatment monitoring.",
