SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were further detected in these MPP patients, followed by Spearman correlation analysis to assess their correlation with cytokines in MPP children. Age-specific cytokine patterns emerged in MPP children. In 0-2 years, cytokines enriched in IL-17, TLR, and TNF pathways were upregulated in MPP groups compared to controls, while in 6-12 years, cytokines enriched in TLR, RLR, and JAK-STAT pathways were downregulated in MPP groups. Serum patterns in 3-5 years resembled those in 0-2 years, but BALF aligned with 6-12 years. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positively correlated with TWEAK, IL-22, IL-16, IL-12p40, CCL7, and CD152 in 0-2 years (P < 0.05), but negatively with CCL13 in 6-12 years (P < 0.01). Overall, the immune pattern in children with MPP is age-specific and severity-dependent. Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG are associated with a more robust and mature anti-infective immune response in younger MPP patients, while in older children, besides providing immune memory against pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 IgG also appears to plant a landmine of immune exhaustion.",
