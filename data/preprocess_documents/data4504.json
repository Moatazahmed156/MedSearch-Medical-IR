    "abstract": "Our experiences with 28 patients who had a history of liquid \"silicone\" injections of the breasts has led us to recognize a typical clinical picture. Several years after the injections, the patient may develop hard, lumpy, tender breasts which make the detection of breast cancer impossible. Mammograms are generally inconclusive. Despite the reluctance of the patients and surgeons, the conservative approach is a subcutaneous mastectomy with possible subsequent reconstruction.",
