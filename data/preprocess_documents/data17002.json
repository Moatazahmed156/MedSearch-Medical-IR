The top tools in accuracy are MutPred2, ESM1b, AlphaMissense, and PROVEAN. In terms of the MCC and F score, the higher degree was observed in MutPred2 and AlphaMissense (MCC score >0.8). ClinPred, AlphaMissense, and BayesDel_addAF had a higher AUC score (AUC > 0.99). SIFT, SIFT4G, Polyphen2_HDIV, Polyphen2_HVAR, ClinPred, and AlphaMissense scores exhibited a distinct bimodal distribution. While scores from other predictors showed a wider distribution range.
