    "title": "CRISPR Treatments for AI-Designed Synthetic Viruses: Rapid Programmable Countermeasures for Emerging and Engineered Viruses.",
    "abstract": "The convergence of artificial intelligence and synthetic biology is innovating and accelerating the design of novel viral genomes, expanding both therapeutic opportunities and dual-use risk. This review articulates a countermeasure strategy for emerging and engineered viruses leveraging the programmable CRISPR modality. Building on mounting in vitro and in vivo evidence that Cas9 degrades DNA viruses (e.g., Orthopoxviruses, HSV-1, ASFV), while Cas13 targets RNA viral genomes (e.g., Influenza A, Dengue, RSV), both leading to reduced viremia, diminished disease burden, and alleviated symptoms. Here, we outline a rapid-response pipeline to position CRISPR-based countermeasures in translational and pandemic-response frameworks, linking real-time sequencing to AI-assisted gRNA selection and multiplexed cassette design to achieve viral targeting efficacy. To minimize resistance and off-target risk, we emphasize multi-gRNA cocktails, continuous genomic surveillance, and adaptive gRNA rotation. We also propose governance mechanisms, such as pre-cleared gRNA repositories, transparent design logs, standardized off-target/safety screening, and alignment with evolving nucleic-acid-synthesis screening frameworks to enable emergency deployment while preserving security. Furthermore, compressing the time from sequence to treatment and complementary to vaccines and small-molecule antivirals, CRISPR represents a technologically agile and strategically essential capability to combat both natural outbreaks and AI-enabled biothreats. Collectively, programmable CRISPR antivirals represent an auditable, rapidly adaptable foundation for next-generation biodefense preparedness.",
