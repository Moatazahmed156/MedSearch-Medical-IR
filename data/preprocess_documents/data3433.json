    "abstract": "Spinal automatisms and reflexes, peripheral neurogenic and myogenic reactions are common in patients with irreversible brain death. They are therefore compatible and are even understood by experienced investigators as confirmation of irreversible brain death. This article provides an overview of the phenomenology of irreversible brain death and discusses it from a neuropathological perspective. Furthermore, irreversible brain death is described in order to distinguish it from pathological movements and motor reactions in comatose patients or patients with disturbed consciousness due to severe brain disorders.",
