    "abstract": "Stem cells have been attractive targets for tissue regeneration due to their inherent ability to differentiate into various specialized cell types; however, efforts for stem cell transplantation for the treatment of degenerated tissues have been hampered by the propensity of some stem cell types to form teratomas and the lessened viability of stem cells after transplantation. These disadvantages can be prevented using tailored extracellular matrix-like materials that can be used as an aid for the transplantation of stem cells. Nanomaterials, in particular nanofibers, have great potential to be used as extracellular matrix-like materials for this purpose. In this article, we will review the use of stem cells and nanofibers for skin regeneration and wound healing.",
