    "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. The current study investigates the role of oxidative low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1) within the hematoma microenvironment, focusing on its impact on immune responses and disease progression in ICH patients. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), including peripheral blood, brain tissue, and hematoma samples, we identified significant upregulation of OLR1, particularly in hematoma regions. This upregulation was strongly correlated with increased monocyte and macrophage activity, exacerbating neuroinflammation and contributing to poor clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) further elucidated the involvement of OLR1 in monocyte-driven immune responses, suggesting its critical role in the pathophysiology of ICH. Validation through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that OLR1 expression was significantly higher in hematoma samples than in peripheral blood, with the most notable elevation observed in patients with poor prognoses. Our findings suggest that OLR1 could serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in ICH. Targeted therapies to regulate OLR1 expression could potentially mitigate neuroinflammation and improve recovery outcomes. This study not only enhances the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ICH but also provides a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies that focus on the hematoma microenvironment and immune modulation.",
