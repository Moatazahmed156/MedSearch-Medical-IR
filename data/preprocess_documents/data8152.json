    "abstract": "The mechanisms of secondary injury following spinal cord injury are complicated. The role of ferroptosis, which is a newly discovered form of regulated cell death in the neurovascular unit(NVU), is increasingly important. Ferroptosis inhibitors have been shown to improve neurovascular homeostasis and attenuate secondary spinal cord injury(SCI). This review focuses on the mechanisms of ferroptosis in NVU cells and NVU-targeted therapeutic strategies according to the stages of SCI, and analyzes possible future research directions.",
