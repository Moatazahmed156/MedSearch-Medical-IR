    "abstract": "The renal lymphatic system is critical for maintaining kidney homeostasis and regulating the immune response inside the kidney. In various kidney pathological situations, the renal lymphatic network experiences lymphangiogenesis, which is defined as the creation of new lymphatic vessels. Kidney lymphangiogenesis controls immunological response inside the kidney by controlling lymphatic flow, immune cell trafficking, and immune cell regulation. Ongoing study reveals lymphangiogenesis's different architecture and functions in numerous tissues and organs. New research suggests that lymphangiogenesis in kidney disorders may regulate the renal immune response in various ways. The flexibility of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) improves the kidney's immunological regulatory function of lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, current research has shown disparate findings regarding its impact on distinct renal diseases, resulting in contradictory outcomes even within the same kidney condition. The fundamental causes of the various effects of lymphangiogenesis on renal disorders remain unknown. In this thorough review, we explore the dual impacts of renal lymphangiogenesis on several kidney pathologies, with a particular emphasis on existing empirical data and new developments in understanding its immunological regulatory function in kidney disease. An improved understanding of the immunological regulatory function of lymphangiogenesis in kidney diseases might help design novel medicines targeting lymphatics to treat kidney pathologies.",
