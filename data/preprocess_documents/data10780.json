    "abstract": "Lung disease in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult-onset Still's disease (Still's-LD) is a severe manifestation strongly associated with HLA-DRB1*15 alleles and features of drug hypersensitivity reactions (fDHR), including eosinophilia, non-Still's rashes, and elevated liver function tests. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of these phenomena, pathogenesis remains poorly understood. This study investigates whether Still's-LD and fDHR are associated with pathogenic antigens through hypersensitivity reactions to  Pediatric and adult subjects were drawn from the NIH Still's disease cohort. Subjects with Still's-LD and/or fDHR were identified by chart review. Serum samples were analyzed for anti- Fifty-four subjects were included in the study, 11 had LD and fDHR and 8 had fDHR alone. Thirty-three subjects were tested for anti- The absence of anti-",
