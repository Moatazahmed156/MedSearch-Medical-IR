    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly lethal disease, which is usually diagnosed at a late stage with extensive metastases in the abdominal cavity. Ovarian cancer either develops from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) or from serous intra-epithelial carcinoma (STIC). Primary therapy consists of debulking surgery and platinum based chemotherapy. The success of debulking surgery depends on surgical skills but also on the gene signature of the tumour. Debulking surgery combined with first line platinum based chemotherapy, frequently leads to complete remission. However, most ovarian cancers relapse. Once the disease has relapsed, the interval between subsequent therapies decreases steadily due to rapid progression and therapy resistance. Research on therapy resistance of ovarian cancer is frequently devoted to genetic alterations in cancer cells, leading to drug inactivation, enhanced DNA repair mechanisms and intracellular pathway derangements. However the knowledge of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) and the role they play in the development of cancer and therapy resistance is sparse. In this review current knowledge on the characteristics of OCSCs and the micro environmental mechanisms leading to the development or activation of OCSCs resulting in ovarian cancer is reviewed. Moreover the role of OCSC in both surgical and systemic therapy resistance and the relation with epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is discussed, as are micro-environmental signals leading to OCSC or EMT activation.",
