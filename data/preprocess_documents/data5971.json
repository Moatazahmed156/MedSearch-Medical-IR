    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      The development and progression of heart failure is characterized by metabolic and physiologic adaptations allowing patients to cope with cardiac insufficiency. This review explores the changes in metabolism in heart failure and the potential role of biomarkers, particularly ketone bodies, in staging and prognosticating heart failure progression.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Recent insights into myocardial metabolism shed light on the heart's response to stress, highlighting the shift towards reliance on ketone bodies as an alternative fuel source. Elevated blood ketone levels have been shown to correlate with the severity of cardiac dysfunction, emphasizing their potential as prognostic indicators. Furthermore, studies exploring therapeutic interventions targeting specific metabolic pathways offer promise for improving outcomes in heart failure. Ketones have prognostic utility in heart failure, and potentially, an avenue for therapeutic intervention. Challenges remain in deciphering the optimal balance between metabolic support and exacerbating cardiac remodeling. Future research endeavors must address these complexities to advance personalized approaches in managing heart failure.",
