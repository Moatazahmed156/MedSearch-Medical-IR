    "abstract": "Recently, the role of inorganic ions has been explored for its wound-healing applications. Ions do play key role in the normal functioning of the skin, including the epidermal barrier property, maintaining redox balance, enzymatic activities, tissue remodeling, etc. The care of chronic wounds is a concern and new cost-effective therapeutic strategies that modulate the wound microenvironment and cell behaviour are needed. First, this review illustrates the ions that play a role in wound healing and their molecular mechanisms that are accountable for modifying the wound. Further, the emerging strategies using metal ions to modulate the healing will be discussed. In this direction, localized delivery of inorganic ions of importance using advanced wound care biomaterials for wound healing applications is discussed.",
