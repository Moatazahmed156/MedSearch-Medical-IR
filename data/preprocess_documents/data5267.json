Conscious perception of these sensations is imperative for appropriate urine storage and voiding at a socially accepted time and place and depends on the integrity of the afferent axis urothelium -- peripheral nerves -- spinal cord -- pons -- mesencephalon -- sensory cortex. This review considers the current knowledge about normal and impaired sensations arising from the bladder and the sphincter and addresses their clinical significance.",
