    "abstract": "B cells play a critical role in knee osteoarthritis (KOA), however, the heterogeneity, activation mechanisms, and their contribution to cartilage damage in KOA joints are still not fully understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on joint tissues from 9 healthy controls and 21 KOA patients, integrating transcriptomic profiling, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and ligand-receptor interaction mapping. Key findings were validated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, in vitro co-culture systems, and a murine KOA model induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection and destabilization of the medial meniscus (ACLT + DMM). scRNA-seq analysis identified 31 cell clusters, with B cells showing marked enrichment in subchondral bone and synovium of KOA joints, particularly in older and female patients. Re-clustering of B cells revealed eight distinct subgroups, including pathogenic DERL3 This study unveils a fibroblast-B cell crosstalk axis mediated by MIF signaling in KOA pathogenesis. Targeting MIF signaling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate B cell-associated joint inflammation and structural alterations in KOA.",
