    "abstract": "This literature review focused on homicide bereavement (HB) risk factors. A content analysis was conducted on 83 empirical papers published in English from January 2000 to December 2021 in peer-reviewed journals. Extracted HB risk factors were synthesized according to six main dimensions: individual level; situational homicide-related factors; and micro, meso, exo, and macro social levels. The review demonstrates that macro-level and situational homicide-related risk factors are in special need of further study. In addition, how HB risk factors interact with one another to influence HB also requires further study. Future research may benefit from examining whether and how individuals experiencing HB influence related factors at various social levels. Last, given that almost all reviewed studies were conducted in Western societies, the sociocultural and ethnic diversity in HB risk factors is in dire need of future study.",
