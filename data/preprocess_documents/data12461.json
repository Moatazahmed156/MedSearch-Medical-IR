    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide despite therapeutic advances. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), an intestinal epithelial receptor, is emerging as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for CRC. Thus, we are interested in developing a monoclonal antibody probe targeting GUCY2C for both in vitro and in vivo diagnosis and treatment of CRC. ",
