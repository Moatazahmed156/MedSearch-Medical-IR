    "abstract": "A stem cell is a particular group of cells that has the extraordinary potential to convert within the body into particular cell types. They are used to regenerate tissues and cells in the body that have been damaged or destroyed by the disease. Stem cells come in three different varieties: adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Embryonic stem cells have a high chance of immune rejection and also have ethical dilemmas and iPSCs have genetic instability. Adult stem cells are difficult to analyze and extract for research since they are frequently insufficient in native tissues. However, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) one of the categories of adult stem cells are stromal cells with a variety of potentials that can differentiate into a wide range of cell types. MSCs can be transplanted into a variety of people without worrying about rejection because they have demonstrated the ability to prevent an adverse reaction from the immune system. These transplants have powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and greatly enhance the body's inherent healing capacity. While MSCs do not offer treatment for illnesses, the idea behind them is to enable the body to recover sufficiently for a protracted reduction in symptoms. In many cases, this is sufficient to significantly enhance the patient's well-being. Inspite of several advantages some potential long-term concerns connected to MSC therapy are maldifferentiation, immunosuppression and cancerous tumor growth. In this review, we will compare the mesenchymal stem cells with other stem cells with respect to the source of origin, their properties and therapeutic applications, and discuss the MSC's disadvantages.",
