    "abstract": "The previous study showed that the red coloration of the ventral skin of the Japanese newt Cynops pyrrhogaster was associated with the number of carotenoid vesicles and the content of carotenoid in the pigment cell of the skin. To elucidate the mechanism for the red coloration of the skin of the newt, we studied the food habit of the juvenile from the Japanese newt Cynops pyrrhogaster. Sixty-two juveniles were collected in Fukue Island in Nagasaki Prefecture from November 2000 to May 2002 and divided into 2 groups according to the snout-vent length (SVL). Over 400 prey animals were obtained from the juveniles by stomach flushing. In the larger group (SVL>30.0mm), Collembola (45.4%) and Acari (12.6%), which are very common species of soil animals, were the prey animals dominant in number. In the group with the smaller SVL (<29.9mm), Collembola (30.4%) and Acari (25.4%) were in number as well. We also studied the food habit of the Japanese clouded salamander, Hynobius nebulosus. In the salamander, Doratodesmidae (56.5%) and Amphipoda (13%) were the prey animals dominant in number. Our results, taken together, suggest that the Japanese juvenile C. pyrrhogaster does not change its food habit as it grows, and that it eats soil animals common in its habitat. Moreover, the food habit of juvenile C. pyrrhogaster differs from that of H. nebulosus, although the juveniles of both species live in the same area.",
