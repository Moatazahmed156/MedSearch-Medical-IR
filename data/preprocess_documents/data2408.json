    "abstract": "Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer is staged surgically using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system. Preoperative imaging can complement surgical staging but is not yet considered a required component in the current FIGO staging system. Preoperative imaging can help identify some tumor characteristics and tumor spread, both locally and distally. More accurate assessment of endometrial cancers optimizes management and treatment plan, including degree of surgical intervention. In this article, we review the epidemiology, FIGO staging system, and the importance of imaging in the staging of endometrial cancer.",
