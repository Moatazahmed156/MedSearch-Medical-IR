    "abstract": "Adolescents and young adults with and without chronic illnesses partake in risk-taking behavior. Clinicians in transplant clinics should be aware of the prevalence of risk-taking behavior in their adolescent and young adult solid organ transplant patients in order to provide complete care. Creating an environment where teens and young adults feel comfortable discussing risky behavior is important and includes creating a privacy policy and increasing comfort of the healthcare provider in asking sensitive questions. This review is intended to help the providers in the transplant clinic screen for and counsel about risk-taking behaviors with their adolescent and young adult patients, specifically around sexual and reproductive health.",
