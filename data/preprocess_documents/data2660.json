    "abstract": "Endothelium-derived vasoactive mediators (endothelin-1 with its vasoconstrictive and mitogenic properties and nitric oxide with its vasodilatory and antiproliferative properties) play an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone and cellular proliferation. Several recent studies have now demonstrated the presence of these vasoactive agents in the urinary tract where they are thought to play a prominent role in urinary tract physiology and disease. This article reviews the synthesis, localisation and actions of endothelin and nitric oxide in the lower urinary tract and examines the possible role of these mediators in disease.",
