    "title": "How the Intake of Pulses May Impact Metabolic Disorders and Dementia Risk: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "We present a narrative review focusing on pulses' geographical origin and distribution, their impact on human evolution and history, and their influence on human health. Pulses, including dry peas, beans, and lentils, are renowned for their richness in chemical antioxidants. Despite containing antinutrients, processing techniques preserve their health advantages. Epidemiological research has consistently demonstrated that the consumption of pulses is associated with favorable effects on metabolism. This evidence is further supported by molecular and clinical research, which has elucidated potential nutrigenomic mechanisms and effects on gut microbiota composition underlying their health benefits. However, the literature lacks randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of pulses on health outcomes. Despite this limitation, our review provides valuable insights into the potential beneficial effects of pulses in ameliorating metabolic disorders and reducing the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Acknowledging the current limitations, we identify areas for further research to generate additional evidence. Specifically, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to thoroughly assess the efficacy of pulses in preventing metabolic diseases. Addressing these research gaps will enhance our understanding of the health benefits associated with pulse consumption and facilitate evidence-based dietary recommendations to improve public health outcomes.",
