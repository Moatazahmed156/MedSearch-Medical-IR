    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a devastating, life-changing event in most cases. After the primary brain insult, it is helpful to use evidence-based monitoring techniques to guide implementation of essential interventions to minimize secondary injury and thereby improve patient outcomes. An update on multimodal neuromonitoring is provided in this narrative review, with discussion of tools and techniques currently used in the treatment of patients with brain injury. Neuroprotective treatments, from the well-studied targeted temperature management to new potential therapeutics under investigation, such as glyburide, also are presented.",
