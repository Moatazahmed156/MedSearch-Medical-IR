    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      This review aims to summarize the capability of lipoxin in regulating oxidative stress.\n    \n\n\n          Background:\n        \n      \n      Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the antioxidant system, and it is associated with the existence of a large number of oxidation products, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reaction nitrogen species (RNS), causing damage to human tissues through immunoinflammatory responses. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress is vital to alleviate pathological damage. Lipoxin, an acronym for lipoxygenase interaction product, is a bioactive autacoid metabolite of arachidonic acid made by various cell types. Previous studies have shown that lipoxin is associated with a variety of biological functions, including anti-inflammatory, regulating immune responses, promoting the repair of damaged cells, etc. The deficiency of lipoxin is a critical pathological mechanism in different diseases. Moreover, the ability of lipoxin to attenuate oxidative stress is noteworthy, thereby protecting the human body from diverse diseases.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched papers from PubMed database using search terms, such as lipoxin, lipoxin A4, oxidative stress, and other relevant terms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 103 articles published over the past 20 years were identified for inclusion. We summarized the capability of lipoxin in regulating oxidative stress and mechanism.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Lipoxin is provided with a protective role in attenuating oxidative stress.",
