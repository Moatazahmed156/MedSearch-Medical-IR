    "abstract": "Although clinical manifestations of myocarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus are uncommon, noninvasive cardiac testing may detect subclinical cases. The pathogenesis of myocarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus has been ascribed to many factors, including autoimmunity, medications, and coexisting diseases. Lupus myocarditis merits urgent clinical attention because of the likely progression to arrhythmias, conduction disturbances and heart block, dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Endomyocardial biopsy can be used to identify the underlying inflammatory histopathology. Usual therapy includes high-dose corticosteroids, in addition to standard cardiac medications.",
