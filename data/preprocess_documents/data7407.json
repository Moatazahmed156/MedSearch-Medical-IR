    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are present in almost all cells, but their existence in stem cells has remains not well established. Circadian clock appears to be closely associated with differentiated mature cells and rarely detected in immature embryonic stem cells. Recent evidence reveals the presence of circadian genes and rhythmic physiologic activities in stem cells as well as stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) characteristics. The circadian clock entails diverse physiologic and pathological mechanisms underlying cell fate. Integration of circadian rhythm to clinical applications, such as chronotherapy, chrono-biomarker, and environment modification, may facilitate therapeutic outcomes of stem cell-based regenerative medicine. Understanding circadian rhythms in stem cells can optimize stem cell-based therapies by determining the best times for harvesting and administering stem cells, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Further research into the circadian properties of stem cells will refine stem cell-based therapies, contributing to advancements in regenerative medicine.",
