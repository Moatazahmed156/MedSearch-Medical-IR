    "title": "High Expression of IGSF10 Confers an Inhibitory Effect on the Progression of Lung Adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Unlike conventional treatments, the targeted therapies or emerging immunotherapies have shown significant advantages in the management of advanced lung cancer. Therefore, exploring novel predictive biomarkers or therapeutic targets is still of far-reaching significance for the future treatment of lung cancer. This study revealed that low expression of IGSF10, an important member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, significantly correlates with poor overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and strong tumorigenic capacity of LUAD cells. Mechanistically, high expression of IGSF10 can inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LUAD cells via p53-triggering ferroptosis and impede G",
