    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the imaging modality of choice in spinal cord diseases. Computerized tomography (CT) myelography remains a valuable alternative and may be performed even on patients with a known sensitivity to iodine contrast media. Ultrasonography provides excellent intraoperative evaluation of spinal cord injury. MRI, however, offers new knowledge about spinal cord disease, especially in trauma, ischemia and degenerative lesions; using this technique direct visualization of ischemic spinal cord lesions is presently possible. Rare infections or degenerative spinal cord lesions are imaged albeit in a non-specific manner. Cervical and thoracic disk disease may cause severe myelopathy, yet close correlation between images and symptomatology remains mandatory.",
