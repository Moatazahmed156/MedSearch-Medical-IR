    "title": "Examination of Appendiceal Neoplasms-A Retrospective, Single-Centre, Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Appendiceal neoplasms are rare, but recent data indicate a rising trend, particularly in patients under the age of 50. These tumours are often diagnosed incidentally during histopathological examination. This study has aimed to examine the incidence and histological subtypes of appendiceal neoplasms in a Southern Hungarian population. Our study included neoplastic appendix specimens processed at the University of Szeged between 2014 and 2023. Neoplasms were identified in 71 cases from 3640 appendectomies (1.9%). Benign lesions were present in 37% of cases ( The prevalence and characteristics observed in this Southern Hungarian population were consistent with international data, although raw case numbers suggested an upward trend. The high rate of associated colorectal neoplasms underscores the importance of thorough pathological evaluation and long-term surveillance.",
