    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance in the redox state in a cell or a tissue. When the production of free radicals, which are physiologically essential for signaling, exceeds the antioxidant capability, pathological outcomes including oxidative damage to macromolecules, aberrant signaling, and inflammation can occur. Down syndrome (DS) and Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) are well-known and common genetic conditions with multi-systemic involvement. Their etiology is linked to oxidative stress with important causative genes, such as SOD-1 and NCF-1, respectively, of the diseases being primarily involved in the regulation of the redox state. Early aging, dementia, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation are some of the main characteristics of these conditions that can be associated with oxidative stress. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the possible role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathology of these conditions. However, at present, few studies have investigated these correlations. We provide an overview of the current literature concerning the role of oxidative stress and oxidative damage in genetic syndromes with a focus on Down syndrome and WBS. We hope to provide new insights to improve the management of complications related to these diseases.",
