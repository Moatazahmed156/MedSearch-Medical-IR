    "title": "Interaction of insula and hippocampus in memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The insula, classically linked with emotion and perception, has recently been associated with memory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its role in memory remains unclear. This study investigated whether the insula contributes directly to memory consolidation or is indirectly involved in memory-related brain regions. We systematically increased diagnostic specificity in memory-impaired patients to assess the role of the insula in memory. Gyrification of the insula was associated with memory consolidation in Aβ+ individuals, only in combination with hippocampal atrophy. These findings suggest insular atrophy interacts with degeneration of the hippocampus in memory dysfunction in AD, but not necessarily in other pathologies.",
