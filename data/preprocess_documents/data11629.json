    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a clinically promising neuromodulatory therapy, capable of promoting function and motor recovery after stroke. Beyond the primary stroke lesion, remote networks disturbances, e.g., stroke-induced secondary neurodegeneration (SND), are related to long-term disabilities. Under the hypothesis that tDCS promotes recovery by supporting neuroprotection, we investigated the effects of tDCS on thalamic SND after stroke. Three days after cortical stroke, induced by photothrombosis, cathodal tDCS over the lesioned cortex was performed daily for ten days (39.6 kC/m",
