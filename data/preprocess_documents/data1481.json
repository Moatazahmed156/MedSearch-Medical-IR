    "abstract": "Highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines through cobalt-catalyzed atroposelective C-H arylation using easily accessible cobalt(II) salt and salicyloxazoline ligand has been reported. This methodology provides a straightforward and sustainable access to a broad range of enantioenriched biaryl-2-amines in good yields (up to 99 %) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee). The synthetic utility of the unprecedented method is highlighted by its scalability and diverse transformations.",
