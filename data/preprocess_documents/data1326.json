    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects both children and adults but epidemiological and clinical data demonstrate that children are less likely to have a severe disease course or die. Furthermore, asthmatic children show less severe disease manifestations when infected with SARS-CoV-2 comparing to adults. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 and childhood asthma interaction and aims at summarizing the current knowledge of the potential mechanisms that ameliorate disease symptomatology in asthmatic children.",
