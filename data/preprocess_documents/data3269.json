    "abstract": "Herpes zoster is a common condition that significantly affects health-related quality of life. Most cases occur in immunocompetent individuals older than 60 years; however, immunosuppressed patients are at particularly high risk. Post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common serious complication of herpes zoster, and is much more common in the very elderly. Vaccination with the zoster vaccine is recommended for most people older than 60, and reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and the occurrence of post-herpetic neuralgia.",
