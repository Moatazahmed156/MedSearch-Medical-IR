    "title": "Unlocking potentials of a prenylated flavonoid: Xanthohumol's role in combating inflammatory conditions and Rhematic diseases.",
    "abstract": "Xanthohumol, a prenylated flavonoid derived from hops (Humulus lupulus), has garnered significant attention for its multifaceted therapeutic potential. This review highlights xanthohumol's ability to modulate key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, STAT3, and Nrf2, which are central to inflammation, oxidative stress, and cancer progression. As a flavonoid, xanthohumol exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in alleviating inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In cancer, xanthohumol demonstrates remarkable efficacy by inhibiting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis through the suppression of critical pathways like CXCR4 and STAT3. Preclinical studies have shown that xanthohumol selectively targets cancer cells while sparing normal cells, underscoring its potential as a safe and effective anticancer agent. Beyond its anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects, xanthohumol also plays a significant role in metabolic regulation. It improves glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota composition, offering therapeutic benefits for metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Clinical trials and preclinical research further validate xanthohumol's safety and efficacy, with emerging evidence supporting its use in managing chronic diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of xanthohumol's mechanisms of action, therapeutic applications, and future directions in clinical research, positioning it as a promising natural compound for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of diseases.",
