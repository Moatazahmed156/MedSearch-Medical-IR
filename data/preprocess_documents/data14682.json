    "abstract": "Metabolic disorders significantly contribute to global morbidity and mortality. However, data on these trends in the Arab region remain limited despite rising obesity rates and declining metabolic health. This study aims to investigate the trends and burdens of metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and ischemic stroke and related risk factors in the Arab region. A retrospective analysis of metabolic diseases based on the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database. We analyzed age-standardized rates of disease prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2021, using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. In 2021, the Arab region faced a substantial burden: 34.6 million with diabetes, 30.8 million with CVD, 32 million with CKD, 109.4 million with MAFLD, and 3 million with stroke. Mortality and DALYs for these diseases often exceeded global averages. The Arab region faces a significant public health challenge due to increasing metabolic disease burdens and inconsistent mortality reduction. A comprehensive approach addressing lifestyle factors and improving healthcare access is crucial to improving health outcomes and managing this growing burden. Metabolic diseases in the Arab region: 1990–2021 This study examined how common metabolic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and stroke have changed in Arab countries over the past 30 years (from 1990 to 2021). We used data from a large global study to see how many people are affected by these conditions and how they impact people’s health and lives. We found that metabolic diseases are becoming more common in the Arab region. More people are being diagnosed with these conditions, leading to increased disease and death. While some countries have made progress in lowering deaths from certain diseases, overall, the rates remain high. There are also significant differences between countries, with some performing much better than others. Our findings highlight the importance of better prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases in the Arab region. This involves promoting healthier lifestyles, improving access to healthcare, and tackling the factors that increase risk. By taking action now, we can help reduce the burden of these diseases and improve the health and well-being of people across the region. The data reveal that countries affected by war face additional challenges. This emphasises the negative effects of political and economic instability on health and highlights the need for regional cooperation to address health inequalities and improve overall well-being.",
