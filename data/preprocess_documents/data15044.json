    "title": "Immediate-Onset Acute Pancreatitis During Transarterial Chemoembolization: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used in treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while acute pancreatitis represents a rare but serious complication of this procedure. This article reports the case of a 57-year-old male with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis and China Liver Cancer stage IIb HCC who experienced the abrupt onset of acute pancreatitis during the TACE procedure, immediately following the embolic infusion. By reviewing the patient's clinical presentation, imaging data, laboratory findings, and treatment process, we infer that the acute pancreatitis was most likely caused by the reflux of embolic material, leading to pancreatic ischemia. This report focuses on the clinical features, underlying mechanisms, and prevention strategies of acute pancreatitis complicating TACE procedures.",
