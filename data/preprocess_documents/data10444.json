    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation often coexist and exacerbate each other, creating a therapeutic challenge when both are present. This case presents a patient with suspected tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) progressing to cardiogenic shock, managed with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as an additional therapeutic pillar. We report the case of a 57-year-old male with  Treatment of HF with GDMT should be performed simultaneously and harmonized with rhythm and rate control. This case highlights the role of early rhythm control and the potential of left ventricular ejection fraction improvement after PVI in patients with TIC.",
