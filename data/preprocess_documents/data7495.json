    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women. Despite an increase in incidence, breast cancer mortality has drastically dropped over the last 20 years. This change has been attributed to advances in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. This review summarises recent updates in the clinical approach to breast cancer. Advances in genetics have facilitated the stratification of the risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer. Advances in biology have led to the development of novel therapies (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, HER2 targeted agents). Their combination with endocrine (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, GnRH-analogues, fulvestrant) and systematic therapy (anthracyclines, taxanes) in early and advanced disease have improved clinical outcomes. In the near future, neoadjuvant strategies in specific breast cancer subgroups (triple-negative breast cancers) and novel strategies (immune-modulatory agents) could further improve histopathological responses and survival. Radical mastectomies have been widely replaced by breast-conserving operations, while the traditional axillary dissection is being replaced with sentinel node techniques. Breast cancer therapeutics represents a great challenge due to patients' heterogeneous molecular and clinical characteristics, while the identification of reliable and easily reproducible predictive factors could further improve individualized treatment.",
