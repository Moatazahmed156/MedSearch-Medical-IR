    "abstract": "Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 2 (ASIC2) has been implicated in mechanosensation. We reported previously that ASIC2 is highly expressed in aortic baroreceptor neurons and contributes to baroreceptor mechanotransduction; and that ASIC2 deficient mice exhibit decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), sympathovagal imbalance and neurogenic hypertension. Oxidative stress is widely considered an important contributor to hypertension. The major goal of this study was to determine if treatment of ASIC2",
