    "abstract": "Myeloid cells are important effector cells in the injured spinal cord tissue. Microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages serve important functions in the injured spinal cord, and their distinctive roles can now be studied more efficiently with the help of reporter mice and cell specific markers that were described in recent years. Focusing on microglia, this review discusses the microglial response to injury, microglia specific effects and the interaction between microglia and other cell types in the injured spinal cord.",
