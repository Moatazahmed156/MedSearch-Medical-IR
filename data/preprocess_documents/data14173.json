    "title": "A bibliometric analysis of tibial plateau fractures: unveiling the global research landscape, hotspots, and trends.",
    "abstract": "Tibial plateau fractures (TPFs) represent complex intra-articular injuries associated with substantial morbidity and considerable socioeconomic burdens. Although extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this field, a comprehensive overview of the global research landscape, encompassing evolving research hotspots, emerging trends, and identified knowledge gaps, remains largely undescribed. Publications related to TPFs from the period 2000 to 2025 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. The analysis of publication trends, collaborative relationships, citation networks, thematic evolution, and emerging research frontiers was conducted using quantitative visualization techniques facilitated by Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. A total of 1546 publications, comprising 1427 articles and 119 reviews, were included in the analysis. The United States (30.7 %) and China (23.7 %) emerged as the most productive countries, with Hebei Medical University making the most significant institutional contributions. The  This analysis establishes a comprehensive framework for delineating the evolutionary trajectory of TPF research. The findings underscore the dominant position of the United States and China in terms of publication output. Furthermore, this analysis identifies several critical emerging research frontiers, including biomechanical evaluation, management of postoperative complications, and strategies for addressing complex fractures. To propel further advancements in this field, strengthened international collaboration across countries, institutions, and research teams is essential.",
