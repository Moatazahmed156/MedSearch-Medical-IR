Exercise and weight loss are effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but weight loss is difficult to maintain. Sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin are equally efficacious in improving glucose control in type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of intensive insulin treatment in delaying the onset of complications of diabetes has been established for type 1 and to lesser extent for type 2 diabetes.",
