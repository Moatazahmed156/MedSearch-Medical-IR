    "abstract": "Obesity expands as a global climbing epidemic that is often correlated to cardiovascular diseases and endocrine disorders. Converting white adipocytes to brown adipocytes for enhanced energy expenditure has recently emerged as a promising anti-obesity treatment. However, the conventional approaches to apply browning agents systematically suffer from off-target effects, multiple dosage requirements, and poor patient compliance. To date, various delivery strategies have been reported to deliver browning agents for obesity treatment in a safer and more controllable manner. This review will discuss the latest designs in browning agent delivery systems with a focus on nanomedicines and transdermal patches.",
