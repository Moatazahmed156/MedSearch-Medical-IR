    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modifier involved in tumor formation, invasion, and metastasis. The development of breast cancer is a complex process, and many studies have now confirmed the involvement of DNA methylation in breast cancer. Moreover, the number of genes identified as aberrantly methylated in breast cancer is rapidly increasing, and the accumulation of epigenetic alterations becomes a chronic factor in the development of breast cancer. The combined effects of external environmental factors and the internal tumor microenvironment promote epigenetic alterations that drive tumorigenesis. This article focuses on the relevance of DNA methylation to breast cancer, describing the role of detecting DNA methylation in the early diagnosis, prediction, progression, metastasis, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer, as well as recent advances. The reversibility of DNA methylation is utilized to target specific methylation aberrant promoters as well as related enzymes, from early prevention to late targeted therapy, to understand the journey of DNA methylation in breast cancer with a more comprehensive perspective. Meanwhile, methylation inhibitors in combination with other therapies have a wide range of prospects, providing hope to drug-resistant breast cancer patients.",
