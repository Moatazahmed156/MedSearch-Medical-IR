    "abstract": "Under the backgrounds of urbanization expansion, agricultural development transformation, and the steady advancement of ecological civilization construction, identifying and measuring land use conflicts in production-living-ecological overlapping spaces is crucial for the coordinated development of national land space. We integrated two potential land use conflicts identification methods: production-living-ecological functional characterization and multi-scenario simulation, incorporated ecological risk theory to develop a research framework based on scenario simulation-potential conflicts identification-potential conflicts measurement. We identified and measured potential land use conflicts in three scenarios for Chang'an District of Xi'an in 2030. The results showed that under the ecological bottom-line scenario, Chang'an District experienced the least land use change in 2030, maintaining a relatively stable regional ecological security level, with the smallest potential land use conflicts area of 198.91 km2. Across the three scenarios, the area of living-ecological conflicts was significantly larger than that of production-ecological conflicts. The total area of comprehensive potential land use conflicts in Chang'an District was 332.93 km2, with severe conflicts concentrated in the Qinling Mountains' foothills, as well as the Fenghe and Juehe River basins, involving 35 villages.",
