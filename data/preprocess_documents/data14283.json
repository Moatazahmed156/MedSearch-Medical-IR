    "title": "Mechano-metabolic dysregulation in osteoarthritis: Piezo1-mediated mitophagy impairment as a novel therapeutic target.",
    "abstract": "The recent study by Yu et al. (2025) elucidates a critical mechanism linking mechanical stress to mitochondrial dysfunction in osteoarthritis (OA), demonstrating that Piezo1 activation is associated with impaired PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, leading to chondrocyte injury and cartilage degradation. While this work significantly advances our understanding of OA pathogenesis by integrating biomechanical and bioenergetic perspectives, key aspects require further exploration. Specifically, the downstream signaling mechanisms mediated by calcium influx, the potential role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammasome activation, and alternative therapeutic strategies beyond Piezo1 inhibition warrant deeper investigation. This commentary highlights these avenues for future research and emphasizes the importance of targeting mitochondrial quality control as a promising approach for OA therapy.",
