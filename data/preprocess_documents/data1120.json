    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging technique showing molecular diffusion. Cell size, density and integrity influence the signal intensity seen on diffusion-weighted images. This technique is a helpful complementary tool to distinguish tumoral from non-tumoral tissue, and has several interesting applications in the evaluation of head and neck cancer.",
