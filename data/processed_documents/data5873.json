Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the gastric microbiome is essential for gastric disorders such as gastric cancer. Microbial interactions impact the pathophysiology of various gastric disorders. This chapter provides an overview of recent findings regarding general gastric microbial community profiling, microbial interactions in the stomach, and microbial characteristics in various gastric disorders.",
