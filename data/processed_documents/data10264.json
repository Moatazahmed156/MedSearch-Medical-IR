    "abstract": "Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy of 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in detecting, quantifying, and localizing prior myocardial infarction (pMIs) using cardiac MRI as the reference standard. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, consecutive patients referred for cardiac MRI and their recorded digital ECGs were evaluated between January 2018 and August 2020. Patients underwent cardiac MRI assessment for coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy. Late gadolinium enhancement was assessed across a 17-segment heart model for patients with and without ischemia. Two blinded cardiologists independently applied the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction ECG criteria to identify pMIs. Diagnostic accuracy of ECG in detecting pMI was assessed by calculating accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity; χ",
