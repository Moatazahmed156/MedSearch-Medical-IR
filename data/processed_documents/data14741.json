    "abstract": "Herein, we report a novel, highly selective, and cost-effective Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio microfluidic paper-based analytical device (ACR-μPAD) for rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) biomarkers. We pioneered the use of manganese-doped zinc sulfide quantum dots (Mn-ZnS QDs) as a catalytic core for synthesizing two distinct molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs): Mn-ZnS QD-MIP-Alb and Mn-ZnS QD-MIP-Cre, specific for albumin (Alb) and creatinine (Cre), respectively. The biosensing mechanism is based on the competitive inhibition of the Mn-ZnS QDs-MIP peroxidase-mimicking activity. In the presence of the colorless substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide (H",
