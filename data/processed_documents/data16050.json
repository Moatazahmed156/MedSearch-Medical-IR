    "abstract": "Viruses hijack the host translation machinery to facilitate their replication by disturbing the host translation. SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 is known to inhibit host translation, yet the mechanistic details are still obscure. In this study, we report that nsp14 can elevate stress granules (SG) formation in a N7-methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. ER/Golgi localized nsp14 promotes m",
