    "abstract": "As the biological, biomarker-driven framework of Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes formalized through revised, consensus clinical criteria, clinicians will confront more and more patients in the earliest, asymptomatic stages of disease. The language and diction used by practitioners to characterize these early patients, whether they are diagnosed with AD, and how their condition is documented in medical and legal records have important implications for both their care and their medical-legal status outside of the health system. Investigation is needed urgently to better understand clinicians' views and practices regarding early AD, as we adapt to new disease definitions in this unprecedented era of care.",
