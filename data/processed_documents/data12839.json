    "title": "CONECT: Novel Weighted Networks Framework Leveraging Angle-Relation Connection (ARC) and Metaheuristic Algorithms for EEG-Based Dementia Classification.",
    "abstract": "Accurate and robust classification of dementia subtypes using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a critical challenge for clinicians and researchers in the field of neuroscience. Traditional methods often rely on limited spectral features, overlooking the rich structural and geometric information inherent in EEG dynamics. CONECT (Complex Network Conversion and Topology), a novel framework, is introduced and built upon four core innovations. First, EEG time series are transformed into weighted networks using a novel Angle-Relation Connection (ARC) rule, a geometry-based approach that links time points based on angular monotonicity. Secondly, a tunable edge-weighting function is introduced by integrating amplitude, temporal, and angular components, providing adaptable heuristics adaptable to the most promising biomarker, i.e., curvature-driven features in dementia. Additionally, two new graph-based EEG features, the Weighted Angular Irregularity Index (WAII) and the Curvature-Based Edge Feature Index (CBEFI), are proposed as potential biomarkers to capture localized irregularity and signal geometry, respectively. For the first time in a dementia EEG classification study using the OpenNeuro ds004504 dataset (raw), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is applied as a feature selection technique to select the most discriminative features and improve model classification and transparency. The classification results demonstrate CONECT's potential as a promising, interpretable, and geometry-informed framework for accurate and practical dementia subtype diagnosis.",
