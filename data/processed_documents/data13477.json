    "title": "Protocol for evaluating the effects of tDCS and tACS on brain oscillations and motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.",
    "abstract": "Here, we present a protocol to assess how transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) affect brain oscillations and motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We describe steps for patient recruitment, electroencephalogram (EEG), stimulation setup, motor assessment, and oscillation analysis. This protocol allows the evaluation of how tDCS and tACS modulate neural activity and improve motor function, providing insights into the mechanisms of non-invasive brain stimulation in PD. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Liu et al.",
