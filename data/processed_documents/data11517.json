    "title": "Ferroptosis-associated transcriptional factors in neurological diseases: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic prospects.",
    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of regulatory cell death with iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, is widely discussed in a plethora of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. There are many preclinical and clinical evidences supporting the critical role of ferroptosis in these neurologic conditions, despite the molecular machinery by which ferroptosis modulates brain dysfunction remains uncharacterized. Transcription factors (TFs) are core components of the machinery that manipulates ferroptosis process genetically. Until now, there is no report on the summarization of role of ferroptosis-associated TFs in neurological diseases. Therefore, here we provided the basic knowledge regarding the regulation of TFs on ferroptotic processes including iron metabolism, antioxidant defense and lipid peroxidation. In addition, we also discussed the recent advances in our understanding of ferroptosis-related TFs in the emerging hallmarks of neurological diseases. The fact that Nrf2 activator RTA-408 is approved for clinical evaluation (phase 2 clinical trial) of its efficacy and safety in patients with Alzheimer's disease supports this notion. Future research on proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) and gene therapy holds promise for optimization of neurological disease treatment.",
