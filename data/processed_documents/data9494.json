    "title": "The Dual Edge of zinc: linking excessive intake to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular risks.",
    "abstract": "Zinc, an essential trace element, plays a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes, including antioxidant defense, immune regulation, and metabolic homeostasis. However, excessive Zn supplementation disrupts these pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. This systematic review explores the dual-edged nature of Zn by examining its molecular impacts, including antioxidant enzyme dysregulation, leptin receptor resistance, and inflammatory marker modulation. While optimal Zn levels confer protective benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress, excessive intake triggers systemic inflammation, oxidative damage, and metabolic dysregulation. Contrasting evidence highlights dose-dependent effects and variability based on genetic and environmental factors, underscoring the need for tailored dietary guidelines. Knowledge gaps persist regarding Zn toxicity thresholds, long-term impacts, and interactions with other nutrients. Public health policies must prioritize balanced supplementation strategies to mitigate risks while leveraging Zn's therapeutic potential in chronic disease prevention. This review emphasizes the importance of precision nutrition and evidence-based approaches to optimize Zn's benefits while minimizing its adverse effects.",
