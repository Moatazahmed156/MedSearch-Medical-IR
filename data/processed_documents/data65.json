    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence shows that higher levels of physical activity reduce the relative risk of colon cancer by up to 20%. To design optimal physical activity interventions for primary prevention, it is important to understand how the specific characteristics of physical activity (type, intensity, overall volume) influence the magnitude of colon cancer risk reduction. Improving our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms will also help to manipulate physical activity characteristics to precisely target mechanisms of action and identify populations most likely to benefit. This review synthesizes the best available evidence to explore how the type and dose of physical activity moderate the protective effect of physical activity on colon cancer.",
