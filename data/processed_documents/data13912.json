    "abstract": "Inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune, infectious, and metabolic disorders, remain major global health challenges due to their complex pathogenesis and limited therapeutic options. In recent years, bioinspired nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach in precision medicine. Among various strategies, macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles (MΦ-NPs) have gained significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility, immune evasion, and lesion-targeting capabilities. This review systematically outlines the construction strategies, biological characteristics, and functional mechanisms of MΦ-NPs. It details the fabrication process, including core material design, macrophage membrane extraction and functionalization, and efficient membrane-core assembly. The current applications of MΦ-NPs in the diagnosis and treatment of non-tumor inflammatory diseases, such as bacterial and viral infections, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and bone tissue repair are comprehensively reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on their unique behavior in inflammatory microenvironments, where they enable site-specific drug delivery, prolonged circulation, and immune modulation, offering innovative solutions to long-standing therapeutic challenges. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging hybrid membrane systems that integrate macrophage membranes with those of red blood cells, platelets, or tumor cells, enhancing both targeting and therapeutic performance. Despite promising preclinical results, challenges remain regarding large-scale production, clinical translation, and biosafety evaluation. By integrating insights from nanotechnology, immunology, and translational medicine, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on the design, functionality, and therapeutic frontiers of MΦ-NPs. Continued advances in biomimetic nanomedicine are expected to drive the development of next-generation anti-inflammatory therapies with high precision and minimal systemic toxicity.",
