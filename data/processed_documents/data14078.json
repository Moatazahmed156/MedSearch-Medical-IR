    "abstract": "Cartilage in the knee and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) rely on subchondral bone for joint homeostasis, whereby osteoarthritis (OA) causes degeneration. In the knee, suppression of osteocytic perilacunocanalicular remodeling drives cartilage degeneration in a destabilization of the medial meniscus model of OA. Given the structural and functional differences between knee and TMJ osteochondral tissues, whether osteocytes also play a causal role in TMJOA remains to be determined. We hypothesize that subchondral bone osteocytes are required for TMJ homeostasis. We evaluated the role of osteocytic MMP13 in the TMJ using 16-week-old mixed FVB and C57BL/6 male mice with osteocyte-intrinsic loss of MMP13 (DMP1-cre Unlike baseline differences in knees of DMP1-cre Despite different roles for osteocytic MMP13 in TMJ and knee, osteocytic MMP13 deficiency protects both joints from injury-dependent effects on subchondral bone.",
