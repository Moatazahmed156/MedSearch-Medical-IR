Curricula to teach pediatric hematology/oncology fellows about quality improvement are lacking. We conducted a needs assessment of pediatric hematology/oncology physicians as a first step for creating a quality improvement curriculum for pediatric hematology/oncology fellows. Curricular topics were identified: root cause analysis, run charts, process mapping, chemotherapy/medication safety, implementation/adherence to guidelines. Identified barriers to curriculum implementation included a possible lack of quality improvement expertise, lack of awareness of quality improvement resources, and limited time.",
