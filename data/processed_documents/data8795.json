This review will focus on the prerequisites for the generation of genetically engineered insulin-producing cells and current methods of gene transfer. A short account of the genetically modified insulin-secreting cell lines generated so far is also given. Although still experimental each of these new insulin-secreting cell lines is a step forward on the way to gene therapy of human diabetes.",
