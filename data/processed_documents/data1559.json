    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that 20 to 40% of all patients with heart failure have normal systolic function. Isolated diastolic dysfunction may be the principle pathophysiological mechanism in these patients. The diagnosis of isolated diastolic heart failure is problematic and not merely based on demonstrating normal systolic function. The prognosis in isolated diastolic heart failure is more favourable than in systolic heart failure. At the present time, there is no licensed treatment for isolated diastolic heart failure and treatment is largely empirical.",
