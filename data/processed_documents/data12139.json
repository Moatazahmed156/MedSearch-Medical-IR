    "abstract": "Background and objectivesLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death globally and in Belgium. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography significantly reduces lung cancer-specific mortality in high-risk populations. Despite robust evidence supporting lung cancer screening, large-scale implementation in Belgium is still lacking. The 'Zuid-Oost Rand Antwerpen Lung Cancer Screening' (ZORALCS) study aims to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a regional lung cancer screening program in Flanders, specifically targeting high-risk adults with a history of heavy smoking. The primary objective is to assess the participation rate. Secondary objectives include evaluating each step of the screening and smoking cessation process.MethodsThe ZORALCS study is a 4-year, prospective, non-randomized, population-based feasibility study. It targets all adults aged 55-74 in the South-East Region of Antwerp (ZORA), inviting 25,885 individuals by regular post. Respondents who have smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime complete an online questionnaire including the PLCO",
