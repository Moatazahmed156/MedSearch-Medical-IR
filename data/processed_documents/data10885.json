    "abstract": "Aging (senescence) is characterized by development of diverse senescent pathologies and diseases, leading eventually to death. The major diseases of aging, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are multifactorial disorders, resulting from complex interactions between multiple etiologies. Here we propose a general account of how different determinants of aging can interact to generate late-life disease. This account, initially drawn from studies of the nematode ",
