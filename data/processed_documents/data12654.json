    "title": "Updates on the role of miR-193b in the pathogenesis of human cancers and other diseases.",
    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, fundamentally influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Among these, miR-193b has garnered significant attention as a potent tumor suppressor in some contexts, while functioning as an oncogene in other situations. Its frequent loss in some types of cancers such as gastric and cervical cancers as well as osteosarcoma positions it not only as a valuable prognostic indicator but also as a potential tool for gene therapy. On the other hand, it has been found to be up-regulated in esophageal and bladder cancers. Meanwhile, data regarding its expression pattern in some types of cancers, such as colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancers is conflicting. Moreover, its influence extends beyond oncology, implicating it in a diverse range of human diseases, including systemic sclerosis, aortic dissection, osteoarthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis and allergic rhinitis. However, miR-193b does not have a single, unified function; instead, its role is highly context-dependent, acting as either a protective molecule or a pathogenic driver depending on the specific tissue and disease. This review aims to consolidate the current updates on the role of miR-193b, detailing its molecular mechanisms, validated target genes, and its burgeoning potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic agent in cancer and other pathological conditions.",
