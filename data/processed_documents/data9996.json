    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in salt sensitivity (SS) of blood pressure (SSBP) and hypertension. A 23-day, multicenter, dietary salt intervention trial (the MetaSalt study) recruited 528 participants who underwent a baseline observation, low-salt, and high-salt interventions. SSBP was assessed and used as the primary outcome, and fecal shotgun metagenome and plasma targeted metabolome were measured. We found that high salt significantly altered 85 gut-microbial species (p < 9.42 × 10",
