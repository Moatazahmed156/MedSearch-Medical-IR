    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) remains without effective disease-modifying therapies, primarily due to limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is), commonly used as anti-diabetics, may offer neuroprotective effects. We aimed to evaluate the potential of repurposing DPP-4Is for reducing the PD risk, using a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, with specific attention to sex. We performed two-sample MR analyses using instrumental variables (IVs) for DPP-4Is derived from gene expression quantitative trait loci (IV",
