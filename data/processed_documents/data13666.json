    "abstract": "An Fc-mutated chimeric aglycosyl anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), otelixizumab, has been used successfully to treat renal transplant rejection and type 1 diabetes, with reduced toxicity compared with traditional anti-CD3 therapies such as OKT3. The aim of this study was to seek preliminary safety data for otelixizumab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A small Phase 1 experimental medicine study was performed in six participants with RA. The primary outcome measure was safety, with a focus on first-dose cytokine release reactions and extent of CD3 All participants experienced a moderate first-dose cytokine release reaction. There was transient lymphopenia but no T-cell depletion, and a temporary CD8 At the dosing regimen used, otelixizumab was associated with an unexpected and significant first-dose reaction in participants with RA.",
