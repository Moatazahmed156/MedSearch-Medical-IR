    "title": "The PELP1 Pathway and Its Importance in Cancer Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a proto-oncogene that serves as a nuclear and cytoplasmic scaffolding protein. PELP1 plays a critical role in nuclear receptor signaling, ribosome biogenesis, chromatin modifications, cell cycle progression, non-genomic signaling, and DNA damage response. PELP1 expression is upregulated in a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, and liver cancers and serves as a prognostic factor for poor survival. PELP1's structural motifs, unique scaffolding function, and oncogenic activity make it a potential target for a range of therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the most recent advancements in PELP1 biology, with a particular focus on the emergent oncogenic functions of PELP1 and its inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.",
