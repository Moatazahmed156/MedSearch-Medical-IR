    "abstract": "Bile diverted into the canine stomach produced histological changes in gastric mucosa of mucus depletion, focal loss of epithelial cell height and focal epithelial degeneration that were maximal around the stoma. Bile depressed the gastric acid secretory response to both pentagastrin and histamine, but produced no change in fasting serum gastrin levels. The preparation used (cholecystogastrostomy) caused an elevation of both alkaline phosphatase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase.",
