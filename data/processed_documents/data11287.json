    "title": "Recurrent Ischemic Stroke Solved: A Case Study of Late Diagnosis of Left Atrial Myxoma.",
    "abstract": "A-35-years old male was presented with recurrent ischemic stroke with left atrial myxoma. The two most common types of ischemic strokes are thrombotic and embolic. Cardiac myxoma is a source of emboli to the central nervous system. In absence of any history of cardiac problems cardiac investigations may not be performed in ischemic stroke and diagnosis of cardiac myxoma may be delayed as in the case reported here. Cardiac myxoma should be considered in any patient presenting with ischemic stroke and echocardiography should be performed to reach a definitive diagnosis.",
