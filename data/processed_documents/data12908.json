    "title": "Luteolin in Safflower Leaves Suppresses Microglial Inflammation Through FOXO3-Mediated ",
    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation driven by microglial activation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a key regulator of microglial inflammation, yet strategies to modulate its expression remain limited. Safflower leaves, a vegetable rich in flavonoids-particularly luteolin-were previously shown to attenuate neuroinflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and ameliorate cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Here, we demonstrated that safflower leaves inhibit microglial inflammation and upregulate TREM2 in APP/PS1 mice. Luteolin, the major active flavonoid in safflower leaves, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-activated microglia. Mechanistically, luteolin enhanced ",
