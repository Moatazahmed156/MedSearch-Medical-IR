    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a famous malignant tumor which is caused by varieties of mutation in multiple genes. In order to detect breast cancer in an earlier time and take appropriate treatment which includes predicting treatment efficacy, we need a more accurate method of discovering the occurrence of breast cancer. With the development of molecular biology and biological detection technologies continue to emerge, molecular markers of breast cancer have gaining more and more widespread attention, and combining with molecular markers of breast cancer in clinical characteristic of individual treatment for breast cancer has become possible. In this paper, we will focus on the advances about molecular markers associated with treatment efficacy in recent years.",
