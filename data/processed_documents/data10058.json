    "title": "Effect of Beetroot Extract Supplementation on Serum Fatty Acid Profiles and Oxidative Stress Markers in Chronic Coronary Artery Disease Patients: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Considering the role of a healthy diet in preventing atherogenesis, the use of beetroot as a functional food with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-dyslipidemic effects due to its high nitrate content and bioactive compounds is one of the interesting approaches in coronary artery disease (CAD), a common worldwide chronic disease. This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that was conducted on 90 male (67.8%) and female (32.2%) chronic patients with CAD for 4 weeks. This secondary analysis investigated the effect of beetroot capsules within three groups on fatty acid profile, total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, and myeloperoxidase. In subjects with 4 weeks of beetroot consumption, significant changes in the level of SFAs/PUFAs (-130  Beetroot capsule consumption had favorable effects on serum omega 3 fatty acids as well as TOS and MPO, the oxidant and atherogenesis factors.",
