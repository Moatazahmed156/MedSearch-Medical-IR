    "abstract": "(1) Background: How to reduce respiratory diseases in animals is a matter of great concern, and this study aimed to investigate the effect of maternal administration with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the lung health of neonatal pigs. (2) Methods: Fifteen sows were randomly allotted to one of five ATRA groups (0, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg diet), respectively; on average, from days 12 to 95 after insemination, lung samples of neonatal pigs were harvested for HE staining, 16S DNA sequencing, and transcriptomic analysis. (3) Results: Compared to neonatal pigs from the ATRA0 group, neonatal pigs from the ATRA4 group had an increased (",
