    "title": "Phosphorylated Ubiquitin as a Clinical Biomarker for Mitochondrial Damage in Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Phosphorylated ubiquitin (pS65-Ub) is generated by the kinase-ligase pair PINK1-Parkin to selectively label damaged mitochondria for degradation via the autophagy-lysosome system (mitophagy). Consistent with increasing mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunctions, pS65-Ub accumulates with aging in human autopsy brain and in mice. pS65-Ub levels are strongly and independently elevated in brains from subjects with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease compared to age-matched, neurologically normal controls. Furthermore, pS65-Ub levels have been used to identify disease risk and potential resilience factors in cells and in human brain. However, it remains unknown whether pS65-Ub measured in biofluids may also be suitable as a clinical biomarker. Here, we used a validated sandwich ELISA based on the Mesoscale discovery platform to assess pS65-Ub levels in over 1500 plasma samples from different cohorts across a spectrum of mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease. We further analyzed almost 150 CSF samples from two independent case-control series with Parkinson's disease to determine whether pS65-Ub levels are associated with disease status and other clinical parameters. While pS65-Ub levels are significantly changed with disease compared to controls in certain samples, current measurements in plasma are not sufficiently discriminatory to serve as a robust diagnostic marker. However, in CSF, pS65-Ub levels were decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to controls, and there was better discrimination between these groups. Our data indicate that pS65-Ub shows promise as a biomarker in CSF but will require further replication in larger cohorts and possibly in combination with additional other measures.",
