    "abstract": "We consider some aspects of cardiac embriology which explain the formation of pericardial cysts, anomalies of venae cavae, types of atrial septal defect (ostium primum, secundum, foramen ovale), anomalies in septal ventricular development by absence of structures to perform the septum (atrio-ventricularis communis, truncus arteriosus), lack of alineation (Taussig-Bing's complex, transposition of the great vessels, Eisenmenger's complex, Fallot's tetralogy) or interruption in their development (isolated ventricular septal defect). Finally the evolution of aortic arcs, ductus, aorta's istmus and anomalies in coronary arteries, are also considered.",
