    "abstract": "Episodic assessment of sensitization patterns within a geographic area helps to monitor the role that specific aeroallergens may play in triggering allergic disease. An assessment of sensitization patterns in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina identified patterns of sensitization that were different from pre-Katrina studies. Whether the patterns had changed since the post-Katrina assessment was unknown. We therefore sought to evaluate the current sensitization patterns in the greater New Orleans area. Seven hundred seventy-six unique patients with at least 1 sensitization identified on a standard 58-allergen skin test panel that includes 24 fungal extracts were evaluated for prevalence, unique sensitization within an allergen group, and patterns of sensitization across patients. Expected results included a high prevalence of sensitization to house dust mites, grass pollen, and spores of  Ongoing refinement of extracts used in skin prick testing will help to monitor changing patterns of sensitization. This monitoring is especially important as climate change, changes in plant cultivation, and urbanization alter ecosystems.",
