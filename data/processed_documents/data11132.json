    "title": "Cough Assessment in Chronic Respiratory Diseases (COASESS): Findings from A Prospective Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "Cough is a key symptom of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchiectasis (BE). Some patients develop chronic cough (CC), defined as lasting over eight weeks, yet its characteristics remain unclear. This study aimed to characterize CC across different chronic respiratory diseases using validated cough assessment tools. This multicenter, prospective cross-sectional study (the COASESS study) was conducted at 10 university hospitals. CC was assessed for intensity (numeric rating scale, NRS), frequency (cough symptom score, CSS), and quality of life (cough assessment tool [COAT], Leicester Cough Questionnaire [LCQ]). Cough hypersensitivity was evaluated using the Cough Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (CHQ). Age, sex, and smoking status were also recorded. Of 303 enrolled patients, 266 with chronic respiratory diseases were analyzed. Asthma patients were younger, more often female, and never-smokers, while COPD and IPF patients were older male ever-smokers (P < 0.001). COAT, LCQ, NRS, and CSS scores differed significantly across diseases, with asthma and IPF showing greater symptom burden and poorer quality of life than COPD or BE (P < 0.001). CHQ total scores were similar across groups, but asthma patients more often reported triggers like talking and post-nasal drip. This study identified distinct CC characteristics across chronic respiratory diseases. Asthma and IPF were associated with greater symptom burden, and cough hypersensitivity varied by underlying condition. These findings support the need for disease-specific CC assessment and management.",
