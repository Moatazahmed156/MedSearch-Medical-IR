    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a leading example of precision oncology, with a growing number of actionable targets. However, long turnaround times (TAT) for biomarker results can delay optimal treatment decisions. We evaluated whether a streamlined workflow could deliver comprehensive molecular reports within 72 h. In this prospective cohort study (UTOPIA protocol), 96 patients with early-stage or advanced NSCLC at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre underwent molecular tumor board (MTB)-centered triage, automated NGS processing, and integrated data review. TAT was defined (in working days) from MTB triage to electronic report validation. Communication was supported by daily operational huddles and intralaboratory pre-MTB meetings using a standardized checklist. All 96 NGS reports met the 72-hour TAT target (100%). The NGS failure rate was 1%. Potentially actionable genomic alterations were identified in 45.8% of patients, most frequently EGFR (24%) and KRAS G12C (8.3%). Other targetable alterations included six ALK fusions (6.3%), four MET exon 14 skipping mutations (4.2%), two BRAF V600E mutations (2.1%), and one RET fusion (1%). An ultrafast biomarker testing workflow for lung cancer, enabled by MTB-driven triage and structured team communication, can reliably generate comprehensive molecular reports within 72 h. This approach may reduce TAT-related treatment delays and support timely biomarker-guided therapy for patients with NSCLC.",
