    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) has been recognized only in the past 20 years. Autopsy studies indicate it is remarkably common, especially among obese persons and patients with type 2 diabetes. Although fatty liver alone is usually benign, an identifiable subset of patients may be at risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver failure. The role of liver biopsy is controversial. No specific, effective therapy as yet exists, although management of weight, lipid levels, and glucose levels is recommended.",
