    "abstract": "The amyloid beta-peptide theory of Alzheimer's Disease has helped to advance our understanding of the disease tremendously. A new area of research focuses on the changes in neuronal network activity that take place and may contribute to the clinical and pathological picture of Alzheimer's Disease. An apparent symptom of altered neuronal network activity in Alzheimer's Disease is an increased frequency in epileptic seizures that is observed both in human patients and in mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease. A root cause for altered network activity may be amyloid beta itself by its ability to alter synaptic (glutamatergic) transmission and to impair the induction of long-term potentiation. It is on this aspect of Alzheimer's Disease research that the current issue of NeuroMolecular Medicine will focus. Reviews will discuss the basic research and clinical aspects of the issue such as the effects of amyloid beta on synaptic transmission and neuronal networks, as well as the changes in functional MRI activation patterns observed in early stages of Alzheimer's Disease and the frequency and relevance of epileptic seizures in Alzheimer's Disease patients.",
