    "title": "Exposure to Fine Particulate Air Pollution and Risk of Adverse Health Outcomes in Women and Children in Bangladesh.",
    "abstract": "Bangladesh frequently appears among the top five countries with the most polluted air. Research is essential to understand the various health impacts of air pollution in vulnerable populations. This review compiles evidence from January 2000 to May 2025 on the adverse health effects of air pollution among Bangladeshi women and children. Long-term exposure mainly from biomass fuel burning leads to various health consequences in women, especially during pregnancy. Early life exposure also results in harmful health outcomes in children. Research on the effects of air pollution exposure in Bangladesh has primarily focused on adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes, chronic respiratory diseases and hypertension. There is limited information on childhood mortality, malnutrition, developmental disorders, and noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and mental illness, and occupational exposure-related outcomes. Further research is needed to establish a causal link between air pollution exposure and health impacts and inform interventions. Policies for air pollution mitigation require strict monitoring and enforcement by the government.",
