    "title": "Biomimetic Bimetallic-Polyphenol Network as a Novel siRNA Carrier for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis via Macrophage Repolarization.",
    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an auto-immune disease characterized by inflammatory episodes and joint degradation. Activated macrophages produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which damage chondrocytes and destroy the cartilage matrix. Therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA is to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS to promote macrophage polarization and facilitate cartilage repair. In this paper, an active targeting nanomedicine based on metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) is constructed to re-polarize activated macrophages for RA therapy. Sr",
