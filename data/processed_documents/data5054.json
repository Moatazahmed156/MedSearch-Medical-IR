    "abstract": "Basic, epidemiological and clinical issues to be solved on prostate cancer were discussed as a preface. Sharp increase of prostate cancer incidence in Asian countries, almost constant level of latent cancer are intriguing epidemiological and pathological issues. Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer, hormone-refractory prostate cancer has been a long-standing clinical challenge. New radiotherapy is expected for further advancement. Heterogeneity, clonility, multiplicity of prostate cancer are interesting pathological challenges.",
