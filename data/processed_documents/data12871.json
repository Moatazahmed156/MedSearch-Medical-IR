    "title": "Targeting innovative therapeutic approaches to the hallmarks of aging to combat Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Aging is the leading risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Mounting evidence implicates twelve interconnected hallmarks of aging, such as genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and altered intercellular communication, as core contributors to cognitive decline. In this review, we will first delineate the hallmarks of aging and their mechanistic roles according to their functions in the aging brain and Alzheimer's disease. These hallmarks can be grouped into four major functional clusters: (i) Genomic and epigenomic instability, (ii) proteostasis and organelle dysfunction, (iii) cellular fate and regenerative decline, and (iv) cellular senescence. Then, we provide an overview of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at modifying these hallmarks, focusing on the emerging paradigm of supplementation of rejuvenation factors that are derived from young plasma, stem cell secretomes, or their derivatives (e.g., extracellular vesicles). Finally, we discuss key aging-related biological factors that can influence Alzheimer's disease progression and evaluate their potential as therapeutic targets.",
