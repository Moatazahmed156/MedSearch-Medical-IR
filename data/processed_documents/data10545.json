    "title": "Performance of the Asthma Clinical Score and the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure in obese children presenting to the emergency department for asthma exacerbations.",
    "abstract": "Our primary objective was to evaluate the interrater reliability (IRR), responsiveness and predictive validity of two asthma severity scores in obese and normal weight (NW) children. Our secondary objective was to compare asthma interventions in these groups. This was a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of children aged 2-to- < 18 years treated for asthma exacerbations in the emergency department. Obesity was defined as >95 399 children were enrolled, 111 classified as obese. In obese children, the ACS showed moderate IRR, while the PRAM showed weak IRR (κ Performance of the ACS and PRAM varied between obese and NW children. Future studies should aim to fully elucidate the performance and utility of asthma severity scores in obese children.",
