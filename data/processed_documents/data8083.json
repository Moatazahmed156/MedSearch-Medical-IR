    "abstract": "The development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is multifactorial, and the risk factors include both genetic and environmental factors. Although tobacco smoking is an established risk factor for COPD, many other associated factors remain underappreciated or neglected. Upto 50% of cases of COPD can be attributed to nonsmoking risk factors. This article describes the role of tobacco smoking and the various environmental risk factors associated with the development of COPD.",
