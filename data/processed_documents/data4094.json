    "abstract": "This case report is about a 19-month-old boy, product of an in vitro fertilization twin pregnancy and born to young non-consanguineous parents, who presented with speech and motor developmental delay. On genetic evaluation, he was found to have the exceedingly rare variant 49, XXXYY of Klinefelter syndrome.
