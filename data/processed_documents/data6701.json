    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that usually presents at a late stage. Common sites of metastasis include the liver, lung and adjacent lymph nodes. Cervical lymph node involvement has been reported previously but there are no documented cases of submandibular lymph node metastasis in the available literature. We describe a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastasis to the left submandibular lymph node with no confirmed concurrent sites of metastasis.",
