    "title": "Cellular Senescence in Kidney Diseases: From Bench to Clinic.",
    "abstract": "Kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), are global public health problems with high morbidity and mortality. Cellular senescence, which represents a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest accompanied by functional deterioration, is closely associated with AKI, CKD, and RCC. Senescent cells, including tubular epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, podocytes, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells, have been detected in the kidneys of patients, animals, and cells with AKI, CKD, and RCC. However, the roles of cellular senescence and its related mechanisms in AKI, CKD, and RCC remain largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the roles of cellular senescence and its associated mechanisms in AKI, CKD, and RCC. We will also explore the emerging therapeutic targets of cellular senescence and provide potential clinical strategies for treating AKI, CKD, and RCC. Finally, we will discuss the current challenges and future directions for targeting cellular senescence in the management of AKI, CKD, and RCC.",
