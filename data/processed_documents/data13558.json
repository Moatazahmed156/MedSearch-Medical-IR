    "title": "Transient Receptor Potential Channels as Key Regulators of Neuroinflammation in Neurological Disorders: Mechanistic Insights, Therapeutic Potentials, and Future Directions.",
    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, a ubiquitous family of nonselective cation channels, are extensively expressed across the nervous system, immune system, and peripheral tissues. These channels serve as critical sensors for detecting temperature, mechanical forces, and chemical stimuli, thereby regulating numerous physiological and pathological processes. Over the past decade, their pivotal role in neuroimmune crosstalk and inflammatory signaling has emerged as a key focus within neuroscience research. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in PubMed using key terms \"TRP channel,\" \"neuroinflammation,\" and each of the following neurological disorders: neuropathic pain, migraine, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. This review synthesizes the current evidence to elucidate the dual-edged contributions of TRP channels as mediators of inflammation in neuropathic pain, migraine, stroke, MS, AD, PD, ASD, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we also evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies targeting TRP channels, encompassing both nonpharmacological approaches and pharmacological interventions. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational perspectives, this review highlights TRP channels as promising targets for precision medicine and underscores their potential in the development of novel, mechanism-based therapies for complex neurological disorders, thereby advancing a new era of targeted neuroimmunomodulation.",
