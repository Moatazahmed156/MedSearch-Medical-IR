    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process, and metabolic disturbances in the microenvironment of chronic wounds and the severe symptoms they cause remain major challenges to be addressed. The inherent properties of hydrogels make them promising wound dressings. In addition, biomembrane-based nanostructures and microstructures (such as liposomes, exosomes, membrane-coated nanostructures, bacteria and algae) have significant advantages in the promotion of wound healing, including special biological activities, flexible drug loading and targeting. Therefore, biomembrane-based nanostructure- and microstructure-loaded hydrogels can compensate for their respective disadvantages and combine the advantages of both to significantly promote chronic wound healing. In this review, we outline the loading strategies, mechanisms of action and applications of different types of biomembrane-based nanostructure- and microstructure-loaded hydrogels in chronic wound healing.",
