    "title": "Application Study of Health Management Model Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution Identification in COPD Patients: A Retrospective Analysis.",
    "abstract": "This retrospective study aimed to evaluate a health management model based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution identification in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. This retrospective case-control study selected 108 COPD patients from the Respiratory Department of our hospital, divided into an observation group (n=54, receiving TCM constitution-based health management) and a control group (n=54, receiving routine health guidance). Primary outcome measures included COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1). After 6 months, the observation group showed improvements in CAT scores (baseline: 24.93±2.61 to 6 months: 22.31±2.12, p<0.001) and FEV1 values (baseline: 1.34±0.71 L to 6 months: 1.79±0.73 L, p<0.001). After propensity score matching, clinical response rates remained higher in the observation group (CAT: 48.8% vs 18.6%; FEV1: 72.1% vs 7.0%, both p<0.001). However, significant baseline differences existed between groups, with the observation group being younger, having shorter disease duration, and better baseline lung function (all GOLD II vs 55.6% GOLD III in controls). This retrospective study provides preliminary evidence suggesting potential value of TCM constitution-based health management in COPD patients. However, significant baseline differences and methodological limitations necessitate cautious interpretation. Well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials with matched cohorts are essential to establish efficacy definitively.",
