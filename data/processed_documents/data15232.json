    "title": "Isolated serosal liver infiltration mimicking cirrhosis in gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma: A report of 2 cases.",
    "abstract": "Pseudocirrhosis is a rare radiological phenomenon characterized by a cirrhosis-like morphology of the liver caused by metastatic disease without underlying chronic liver disease. We present 2 such cases. The first is a 79-year-old male with newly diagnosed gastro-esophageal junction (GOJ) adenocarcinoma with serosal infiltration of the hepatic capsule without peritoneal carcinomatosis. The second case is a 77-year-old female with GOJ adenocarcinoma showing radiological features of peritoneal infiltration and pseudocirrhosis. Neither patient had any history of chronic liver disease. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing pseudocirrhosis, particularly when imaging findings are discordant with clinical or laboratory data, as the diagnosis significantly alters staging and management.",
