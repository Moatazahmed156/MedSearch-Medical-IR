    "title": "Multifaceted Role of Tiliroside in Inflammatory Pathways: Mechanisms and Prospects.",
    "abstract": "Tiliroside, a natural polyphenolic compound found in several plant sources, has garnered attention for its potential to mitigate inflammation and its associated diseases. The current review explores the multifaceted functions of Tiliroside in inflammation-related diseases, delving into the underlying mechanisms and prospects for therapeutic applications. Tiliroside exerts its anti-inflammatory effects through a variety of mechanisms, such as the inhibition of inflammatory mediators' cytokines and chemokines, as well as the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Additionally, it demonstrates potent antioxidant properties, which further contribute to its anti-inflammatory activity by reducing oxidative stress. In preclinical studies, Tiliroside has shown promising results in ameliorating inflammation in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, Tiliroside's ability to modulate immune responses and stimulate tissue regeneration contributes to its potential as a multimodal agent in treating inflammation-associated disorders. In conclusion, Tiliroside emerges as a promising natural compound with a multifaceted role in inflammation-related diseases with understanding the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic prospects may pave the way for novel treatments.",
