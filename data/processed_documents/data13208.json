This metric is particularly relevant in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where accelerated brain aging is exacerbated by β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau accumulation. We investigated the extent to which BrainAge moderates associations between AD biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive decline across two independent cohorts. We examined 1690 participants from A4/LEARN and 349 from HABS (Table 1). Using the Open-Source tool AgeML within each cohort, we built a BrainAge linear regressor model with 5-fold cross validation using MRI-T1 volumetric and FreeSurfer cortical thickness ROIs. We compared predicted ages with chronological age to create a BrainAge Higher levels of Aβ-PET, Tau-PET and p-tau BrainAge",
