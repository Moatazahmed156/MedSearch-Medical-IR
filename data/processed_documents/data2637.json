    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to briefly review recent data concerning urinary tract trauma. Upper urinary tract injuries occur in 1 to 1.5% of all trauma. Bladder trauma and urethral injuries are associated in 8 to 16% of pelvic fractures and perineal lesions. Functional and vital prognosis are reviewed and modern diagnostic management and treatment modalities are also mentioned. The association of urinary tract trauma with other injuries implies an interdisciplinary approach for these patients.",
