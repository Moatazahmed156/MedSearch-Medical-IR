    "abstract": "The characteristics and outcomes of incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs) identified on routine chest CT scans in 138 adult patients over a 24-month period is of interest. Nodule features including size, location, morphology and growth were analyzed alongside clinical follow-up data. The majority of nodules were benign and stable, with only 7.2% showing suspicious features warranting further investigation. Smoking history and spiculated margins were significantly associated with malignant risk. Thus, we show the importance of standardized follow-up and risk stratification protocols for incidental pulmonary nodules.",
