    "abstract": "The urobiome, or urinary tract microbiome, has emerged as a crucial component in maintaining urinary health and defending against infections. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have debunked the long-held belief that the urinary tract is sterile, revealing a unique ecosystem of microorganisms. The urobiome interacts with the urothelium and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) to support local immunity, playing an integral role in defending the urinary tract against pathogens. Through complex communication processes like quorum sensing, the urobiome regulates microbial behavior and controls interactions with host tissues, helping to prevent pathogen colonization and infection. However, dysbiosis in the urobiome can disrupt this balance, making the urinary tract more susceptible to infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs). Studies have highlighted specific microbial compositions associated with both healthy and disease states, suggesting that shifts in the urobiome may correlate with various urological diseases. Furthermore, microbial diversity within the urinary tract differs by factors such as age and gender, reflecting the dynamic nature of the urobiome. Future research focusing on the interplay between the urobiome, host immune defenses, and pathogenic mechanisms may lead to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Understanding how microbial composition changes during disease states could enable targeted treatments, potentially reducing reliance on antibiotics and minimizing resistance issues. The urobiome thus represents a promising frontier in urology, with implications for enhancing urinary health and treating infections more effectively.",
