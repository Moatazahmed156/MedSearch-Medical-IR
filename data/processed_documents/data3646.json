    "abstract": "Fragile-X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy are caused by triplet repeat expansions embedded in CpG islands in the transcribed non-coding regions of the FMR1 and the DMPK genes, respectively. Although initial reports emphasized differences in the mechanisms by which the expanded triplet repeats caused these diseases, results published in the past year highlight remarkable parallels in the likely molecular etiologies. At both loci, expansion is associated with altered chromatin, aberrant methylation, and suppressed expression of the adjacent FMR1 and DMAHP genes, implicating epigenetic mediation of these genetic diseases.",
