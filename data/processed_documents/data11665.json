    "abstract": "The combination of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) represents a promising strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Herein, we developed a dual-atom piezo-catalyst platform (denoted as FeCu-DSPCs) combined with α-PD-1/CTLA-4 to achieve effective immunotherapy against triple-negative breast cancer. Mechanistically, unlike traditional sonodynamic therapy, FeCu-DSPCs exhibited a robust piezoelectric response through a built-in polarized electric field without relying on the piezoelectricity of the substrate material, which promoted the valence electron transfer and captured delocalized electrons. This \"Delocalized Electron Sailing\" (DES) strategy accelerated the rate-determining step of cascade reactions through the increased, e",
