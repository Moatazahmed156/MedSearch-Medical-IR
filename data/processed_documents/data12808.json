    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Aberrant canonical Wnt signaling is a hallmark of this cancer type. It has been reported that LPA is a bioactive lipid that plays different roles in colon cancer by activating its G-protein-coupled receptors, promoting cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis. Although it has been reported that LPA activates canonical Wnt signaling, the mechanisms underlying their interaction remain unclear; this study aims to investigate them. As previously reported, LPA receptor expression changes under malignant conditions: while LPA",
