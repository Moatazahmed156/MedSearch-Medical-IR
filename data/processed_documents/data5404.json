    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is classified as a gynaecological cancer, but the symptoms present as abdominal and they can be mistaken for those of a bowel condition or bladder problems. Target Ovarian Cancer is urging clinicians to recognise the red flags for ovarian cancer, and to never diagnose new-onset irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or overactive bladder in women over 50 without ruling out ovarian cancer. The symptoms of these are also red flags for ovarian cancer and warrant further investigations. This article covers how to spot these red flags, safety netting and what to do if you suspect a woman's symptoms may be ovarian cancer.",
