    "title": "Mitochondria to the rescue: organelle trafficking in renal health and disease.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are central regulators of cellular metabolism, redox signaling, and apoptosis. Their dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy. Recent advances have unveiled horizontal mitochondrial transfer as a novel intercellular communication by which renal cells exchange mitochondria to promote tissue repair through the modulation of metabolic processes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Horizontal mitochondrial transfer, mediated by tunneling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles, has emerged as a potential homotypic rescue mechanism between injured tubular and glomerular cells. In addition, heterotypic mitochondrial transfer from mesenchymal stromal cells to renal cells has been described. These findings open new perspectives for exploring therapeutic mitochondrial transplantation in both acute and chronic kidney diseases. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including elucidating the poorly characterized biological mechanisms underlying mitochondrial transfer, optimizing delivery strategies, and defining the long-term safety and efficacy of mitochondrial-based therapies.",
