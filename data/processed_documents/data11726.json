    "title": "P-gp/BCRP efflux and intestinal metabolism limit tigecycline exposure: Effects of elacridar and voriconazole in mice.",
    "abstract": "Tigecycline (TIG) exhibits poor oral bioavailability and brain distribution. Because bacterial efflux pumps that expel tetracyclines are homologous to mammalian P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), we investigated whether these transporters, along with TIG metabolism, affect TIG pharmacokinetics in mice. BALB/c and wild-type mice received TIG (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally or orally alone, or in combination with the selective P-gp/BCRP inhibitor elacridar (ELA, 100 mg/kg p.o.) and/or the metabolic inhibitor voriconazole (VORI, 40 mg/kg i.p. or p.o.). One group also received a double TIG dose (20 mg/kg i.p.). Plasma and brain TIG concentrations were quantified via ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Differences in area under the curve (AUC) and C",
