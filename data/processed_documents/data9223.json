    "abstract": "Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated cells with great self-renewal and differentiation capabilities that can differentiate into mature cells in specific tissue types. Stem cell differentiation plays critical roles in body homoeostasis, injury repair and tissue generation. The important functions of stem cell differentiation have resulted in numerous studies focusing on the complex molecular mechanisms and various signalling pathways controlling stem cell differentiation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs with a covalently closed structure present in eukaryotes. Numerous studies have highlighted important biological functions of circRNAs, and they play multiple regulatory roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Importantly, multiple lines of evidence have shown the abnormal expression of numerous circRNAs during stem cell differentiation, and some play a role in regulating stem cell differentiation, highlighting the role of circRNAs as novel biomarkers of stem cell differentiation and novel targets for stem cell-based therapy. In this review, we systematically summarize and discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in modulating stem cell differentiation, thus providing guidance for future studies to investigate stem cell differentiation and stem cell-based therapy.Abbreviations: CircRNAs: circular RNAs; ESCs: embryonic stem cells; ADSCs: adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells; ecircRNAs: exonic circRNAs; EIciRNAs: exon-intron circRNAs; eiRNAs: circular intronic RNAs; tricRNAs: tRNA intronic circRNAs; pol II: polymerase II; snRNP: small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; m6A: N6-methyladenosine; AGO2: Argonaute 2; RBPs: RNA-binding proteins; MBNL: muscleblind-like protein 1; MSCs: mesenchymal stem cells; hiPSCs: human induced pluripotent stem cells; hiPSC-CMs: hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes; hBMSCs: human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; hADSCs: human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells; hDPSCs: human dental pulp stem cells; RNA-seq: high-throughput RNA sequencing; HSCs: haematopoietic stem cells; NSCs: neural stem cells; EpSCs: epidermal stem cells; hESCs: human embryonic stem cells; mESCs: murine embryonic stem cells; MNs: motor neurons; SSUP: small subunit processome; BMSCs: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; OGN: osteoglycin; GIOP: glucocorticoid‑induced osteoporosis; CDR1as: cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript; SONFH: steroid-induced osteogenesis of the femoral head; rBMSCs: rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells; QUE: quercetin; AcvR1b: activin A receptor type 1B; BSP: bone sialoprotein; mADSCs: mouse ADSCs; PTBP1: polypyrimidine tract-binding protein; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; hUCMSCs: MSCs derived from human umbilical cord; MSMSCs: maxillary sinus membrane stem cells; SCAPs: stem cells from the apical papilla; MyoD: myogenic differentiation protein 1; MSTN: myostatin; MEF2C: myocyte enhancer factor 2C; BCLAF1: BCL2-associated transcription factor 1; EpSCs: epidermal stem cells; ISCs: intestinal stem cells; NSCs: neural stem cells; Lgr5+ ISCs: crypt base columnar cells; ILCs: innate lymphoid cells.",
