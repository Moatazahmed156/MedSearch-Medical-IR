    "abstract": "We report the case of a 41-year-old woman who initially presented with headache, right hemifacial hypoesthesia, and a right abducens palsy. Initial external investigations failed to identify an etiology, and cerebral MRI was considered normal, although later review revealed subtle meningeal thickening. Approximately two months later, she developed a right pupil-involving oculomotor nerve palsy, followed by progressive visual loss in the right eye, a right inferior quadrantanopia, and a left abducens palsy. Repeat MRI demonstrated a new contrast-enhancing lesion in the right cavernous sinus, vasculitis involving the intracavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery, FLAIR hyperintensity involving the optic chiasm and left optic tract, and dural thickening with contrast enhancement consistent with pachymeningitis. Tuberculosis was suspected based on a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis but was negative for ",
