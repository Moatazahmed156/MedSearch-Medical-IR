    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is an excessive wound-healing response triggered by chronic liver injury. It may eventually progress to cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies available. Deacetylasperulosidic acid methyl ester (DAM), a natural iridoid compound derived from Rubiaceae plants, possesses potential anti-inflammatory activity. However, its role in liver fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Given the critical involvement of inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis in the development of liver fibrosis, this study aimed to investigate whether DAM could ameliorate liver fibrosis by modulating hepatic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis. Using a carbon tetrachloride (CCl",
