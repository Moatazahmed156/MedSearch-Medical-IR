    "title": "Distribution Features and Antimicrobial Resistance Trends of Clinical Pathogens: A Retrospective Study in a Tertiary Teaching Hospital in East China (2020-2024).",
    "abstract": "To examine the distribution of clinical pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance trends in a hospital in East China to provide evidence for rational antibiotic use and infection control. We conducted a retrospective study of bacterial isolates from January 2020 to December 2024. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the VITEK 2 system. WHONET 5.6 and R software were used for data analysis. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and trend tests. A total of 8680 pathogenic isolates were collected. Gram-negative bacteria predominated (74.7%) over Gram-positive bacteria (25.3%). The primary specimens were urine (33.7%), sputum (25.3%), and secretions (19.4%). The leading pathogens were ",
