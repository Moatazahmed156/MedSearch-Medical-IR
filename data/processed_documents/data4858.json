    "abstract": "This article presents features of uncommon high-grade endometrial carcinomas that often pose a significant diagnostic challenge. An update on undifferentiated and dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma is first provided, followed by discussions on more recently defined entities such as mesonephric-like carcinoma of the endometrium and gastric-type endometrial carcinomas. Finally, endometrial carcinoma with germ cell or trophoblastic-like components is discussed.",
