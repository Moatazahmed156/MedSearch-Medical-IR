    "title": "Kremen2 Promotes Colorectal Cancer Progression by Activating the EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Kremen2 is a key regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, implicating in tumorigenesis. While its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the biological function of Kremen2 in colorectal cancer and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its involvement in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. We examined Kremen2 expression in human colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and HCT116) and compared it to normal intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460). A Kremen2-knockdown cell model was established to assess the impact on cell proliferation and migration using standard in vitro assays. The associated signaling pathways were analyzed to determine mechanistic changes following Kremen2 suppression. Kremen2 expression was significantly elevated in colon cancer cell lines compared to normal controls. Knockdown of Kremen2 in HCT116 cells led to reduced cell viability and impaired migratory ability. Mechanistically, silencing Kremen2 resulted in downregulation of the EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Kremen2 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration through activation of the EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These findings identify Kremen2 as a potential therapeutic target in CRC.",
