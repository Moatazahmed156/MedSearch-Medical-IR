    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental conditions (NDC), including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, are associated with increased rates of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease. Such associations are unstudied in diverse populations and while controlling for a range of important covariates. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of ADRD and Parkinson's disease with NDCs in a diverse sample of adults. This case-control study used data from the U.S. All of Us Research Program 2018-2023 from approximately 600,000 adults in the U.S. We matched on ADRD and Parkinson's disease status in order to examine the association of these conditions with NDCs. NDC was more prevalent in ADRD cases than in non-ADRD controls (7.8% versus 2.4%) and among Parkinson's disease cases than non-Parkinson's disease controls (4.5% versus 1.8%). After adjustment for sex, age, education level, body mass index, cardiometabolic conditions, and psychiatric conditions, individuals with ADRD had significantly higher odds of having an NDC compared with controls (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.40-2.99). Similarly, Parkinson's disease cases had 2.09 times the odds of having an NDC as non-Parkinson's disease controls (95% CI 1.66, 2.59) in adjusted models. As the population of individuals with NDCs ages, and more older adults find themselves in the care of clinicians with experetise in ADRD and Parkinson's disease, it is imperative to understand the support needs of this population, and to provide targets for reducing ADRD prevalence in younger or middle adulthood.",
