    "abstract": "In the recent years, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a potential therapy for head and neck malignancies. Although early results appear to be promising, serious acute and late effects have been observed, mainly in patients who have had prior external beam radiotherapy. This review will discuss the radiobiology of SBRT, clinical rationale and outcomes for SBRT in head and neck cancers and focus on the benefits and potential limitations in both de novo and re-irradiation settings.",
