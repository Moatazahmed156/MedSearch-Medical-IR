Due to its objective advantages, internal drainage has been successfully used in surgery of the upper urinary tract. This review outlines the problems associated with the use ofinternal stents, namely difficultyin installation, migration, and reflux and stent obstruction, bacterial colonization of the stent, the development of functional and morphological changes in the drained segment of urinary tract.",
