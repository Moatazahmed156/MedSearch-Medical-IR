    "title": "Nutraceutical interventions for neuroprotection: a comprehensive review.",
    "abstract": "Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, are emerging as promising agents for neuroprotection, particularly through their modulation of gut health. Unlike conventional single-molecule therapeutics that often target isolated pathways, nutraceuticals offer a multi-targeted approach by influencing the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network linking the gut microbiota and the central nervous system. Key nutraceuticals such as probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins have been shown to beneficially alter microbiota composition, reduce intestinal inflammation, and strengthen gut barrier integrity. These changes can significantly influence brain function by modulating neurotransmitter activity and systemic immune responses. This review compares the holistic action of nutraceuticals with the more focused effects of single-molecules, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's Disease and Motor Neuron Diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It discusses how nutraceuticals may mitigate key pathological features of these conditions-including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, through gut-mediated pathways. Despite their potential, challenges remain regarding the standardization of formulations, bioavailability, dosage optimization, and long-term safety. Further clinical research is needed to validate the efficacy of nutraceuticals as complementary or alternative strategies to traditional neuroprotective agents.",
