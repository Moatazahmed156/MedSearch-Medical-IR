    "abstract": "The vasculature plays a crucial role in inflammation and atherosclerosis associated with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with longstanding disease, has an important impact on a patient's quality of life and influences patient life expectancy. Seropositivity, specific human leukocyte antigen variations, antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides, and cigarette smoking are among the genetic and environmental predictors of rheumatoid vasculitis. Atherosclerosis is an early and common finding in rheumatoid arthritis and it correlates with disease duration, activity, and severity. Apart from conventional risk factors such as cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis-related risk factors including disease duration, severity and activity, rheumatoid factor and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides status, functional impairment, C-reactive protein, radiographic changes, presence of the shared epitope, and treatment modalities are all implicated in the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is also considered an inflammatory disease; thus, it may share common pathogenic mechanisms with rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Advances in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying biologic and nonbiologic agents will probably continue to reduce the incidence of vasculitis. Since the goal of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is to decrease inflammatory burden, successful treatment may theoretically reduce the risk of accelerated atherosclerosis.",
