    "abstract": "There is an extensive amount of research and literature discussing the role of various nutrients throughout the wound healing process. Despite the importance of nutrition in wound healing, dietary protocols often remain absent from wound care standards. This may be due to a lack of comprehensive literature that summarises the complexities and considerations associated with nutrient deficiency and supplementation into an easily accessible and inclusive reference tool. The purpose of this review is to assess the nutrients with key roles in the wound healing process, and subsequently provide information that enables optimisation of nutrition in wound healing. The goal is to consolidate the complexities associated with this topic into a simple, easy-to-use reference tool. We have identified the most important nutrients required for optimal wound healing and condensed the findings into an inclusive chart to be utilised in a clinical setting. This reference tool will include patient populations at risk of deficiency, the stage of wound healing in which each nutrient is required, delivery method and recommended daily intake, outpatient recommendations for rich food sources of each nutrient, and considerations associated with each nutrient.",
