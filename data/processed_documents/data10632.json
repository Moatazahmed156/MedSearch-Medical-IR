    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease, affecting hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Mucous hypersecretion, which leads to the formation of mucous plugs within the airways, is a key pathophysiological feature associated with severe asthma and airway remodeling. Persistent airflow obstruction due to mucous plugging has been recognized as a contributor to poor symptom control in patients with asthma. This phenomenon is driven by type 2 inflammation, mediated by elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13, as well as eosinophilic infiltration, which collectively promote the formation and persistence of mucous plugs. The presence of mucous plugging has been linked to the frequency and severity of exacerbations, as well as airflow obstruction. Imaging modalities such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), hyperpolarized ",
