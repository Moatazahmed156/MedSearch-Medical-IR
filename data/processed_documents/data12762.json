    "title": "Improving Cancer Screening Program Evaluation Through Principal Component Analysis-Driven Composite Indicators: Evidence From Lombardy, Italy.",
    "abstract": "IntroductionCancer screening programs are pivotal in facilitating early tumor detection and reducing cancer-related mortality. However, the reliance on individual performance indicators may not offer a fully integrated perspective of screening effectiveness. This study aimed to develop a composite indicator that consolidates key screening metrics using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive objective weights.MethodsData were drawn from the annual collection of breast and colorectal cancer screening activities conducted in 2023 by the eight regional health authorities (ATSs) of Lombardy, Italy. Indicators spanning structural, organizational, clinical-diagnostic, and impact dimensions were standardized and analyzed using PCA. The resulting factor loadings informed weights for computing a weighted arithmetic mean of the z-scored indicators. Robustness was evaluated through sensitivity analyses involving alternative normalization techniques. Additionally, comparisons were made against an equally weighted arithmetic mean of the same indicators.ResultsThe composite indicator identified marked geographical variations in screening performance across Lombardy's ATSs. Structural and organizational factors, particularly examination coverage and participation rates, exerted the greatest influence on overall effectiveness in both breast and colorectal screening programs. In contrast, clinical-diagnostic and impact measures, as well as invitation coverage, contributed less substantially. High correlations in the sensitivity analyses affirmed the reliability of the proposed methodology.ConclusionsAdopting a composite indicator can substantially improve the evaluation of cancer screening initiatives by integrating diverse metrics into a cohesive, objective framework. In doing so, it enables more effective resource allocation, enhances adherence strategies, and guides targeted interventions aimed at bolstering screening success. Why was the study done? Organized screening helps find cancers early, when treatment works best. In practice, performance is usually judged with many separate measures—such as participation, coverage, recalls, or detection rates—making it difficult to get a clear overall picture of how programs are doing. This study set out to create a single, easy-to-read measure that brings those indicators together. What did the researchers do? They used 2023 data from the eight health authorities (ATS) in Lombardy for breast and colorectal screening and combined multiple indicators into a single composite score. To decide how much each indicator should count, they applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique that assigns objective weights, then calculated a weighted average of the standardized indicators. They also checked that results stayed consistent when using different, reasonable ways to prepare the data and when comparing against a simple equal-weights score. What did the researchers find? Performance varied across areas. Organizational factors mattered most: examination coverage and participation rates had the largest influence on the overall score. By contrast, invitation coverage and several diagnostic or early-impact measures contributed less. The composite score was stable across sensitivity checks, indicating the method is robust. What do the findings mean? A single composite indicator gives a clearer, more balanced view of screening performance. It can help decision-makers identify where to focus efforts, allocate resources more effectively, and design actions to raise participation. The approach is transferable and can be extended to other screening programs and future years to track progress over time.",
