A patient is presented who has the typical manifestations of Behçet's syndrome—oral, perianal, and skin ulcerations, arthritis, and thrombophlebitis. His presenting symptom, consisting of severe dysphagia caused by oesophageal ulceration, is unreported in connection with this disease. The ulceration became a perforation requiring surgical treatment. His malnourished state and long-term steroid therapy made him a poor surgical risk and preoperative and postoperative nutritional and respiratory support were necessary. Prophylaxis against thromboembolic phenomena is indicated postoperatively in these patients.",
