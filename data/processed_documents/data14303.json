    "title": "The mechanosensitive Piezo channels as potential therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis.",
    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease characterized by progressive degenerative changes and pain. Current treatments are only symptomatic and show a limited efficacy which underlies the need for novel and more effective therapeutic options. The pathogenesis of OA is complex and different mechanical, inflammatory and metabolic factors contribute to tissue damage and pain. Mechanical signals are important in joint homeostasis as well as in pathological processes critical for the development of OA. Recent research has uncovered the key contribution of mechanosensitive ion channels to the transduction of biophysical and biochemical stimuli in either physiological or pathological contexts. In particular, emerging evidence supports the relevance of Piezo1/2 channels in joint function and suggests a role in regulating osteoarthritic changes. Therefore, Piezo1 may a potential target for cartilage and subchondral bone alterations as well as synovial inflammation and fibrosis while Piezo2 may be relevant in osteoarthritic pain. Although further research is needed, these insights into the role of Piezo channels in osteoarthritic processes may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on the targeted modulation of mechanosensitive systems in OA.",
