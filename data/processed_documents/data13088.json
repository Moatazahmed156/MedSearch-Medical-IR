    "title": "Research on Alzheimer Disease in Italy: A Narrative Review of Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. In Italy, AD represents a major public health and socio-economic challenge. This review aims to summarize current Italian research on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, rehabilitative approaches, and emerging neuromodulation techniques, highlighting contributions and future directions. A narrative review of the literature was conducted, focusing on Italian preclinical and clinical studies, observational and real-world evidence, cognitive and physical interventions, music therapy, non-invasive brain stimulation (rTMS, tDCS, tACS), and digital or home-based rehabilitation programs. Italian research has explored different pharmacological strategies, including multitarget compounds, eptastigmine, rotigotine, and combinatorial therapies (donepezil-memantine, citicoline addition). Non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive stimulation, motor rehabilitation, music therapy, and multidimensional programs, demonstrated benefits on cognition, behavior, daily functioning, and caregiver well-being. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus, showed promising effects on memory, attention, and executive functions, especially when combined with cognitive training. Digital health technologies, including telerehabilitation and home-based brain stimulation programs, further enhanced accessibility and adherence. Challenges remain due to fragmented research, small sample sizes, and limited standardization. Italian research on AD reflects a growing emphasis on integrated, multidimensional, and technologically advanced approaches. Strengthening preclinical studies, promoting multicenter collaborations, and combining pharmacological, cognitive, and neuromodulatory strategies may enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient quality of life. Continued investment in innovation and multidisciplinary research positions Italy to contribute meaningfully to global AD management and prevention.",
