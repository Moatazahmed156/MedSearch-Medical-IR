    "abstract": "Physiological wound healing of the cornea is a complex process and involves numerous multifactorial tissue processes. A proper wound healing, especially without the formation of light-scattering scars, is essential to preserve the integrity and function of the cornea. Misdirected wound healing is of vast clinical relevance as it can lead to corneal fibrosis and the loss of optical transparency with subsequent reduction of visual acuity, up to blindness. In addition to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, the knowledge of therapeutic concepts and options for treating corneal wound healing disorders and fibrosis is essential to counteract a permanent damage of the cornea as early as possible. Nowadays, various pharmacological and surgical options are available for treatment. The decision, appropriate selection and indication for the optimal treatment depend primarily on the genesis and clinical appearance of the corneal wound, fibrosis or scar. The treatment of wound healing disorders ranges from the use of topical therapy and supportive measures up to tissue replacement procedures. As long as the mechanical stability of the cornea is intact and wound healing processes are still ongoing, a pharmacological modulation is reasonable, which is discussed in this article.",
