    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to significant alterations in gut microbiota, which play a crucial role in the mechanisms of injury and recovery. Following TBI, the gut-brain axis (GBA, a complex network involving neuronal, hormonal, and immune pathways) becomes disrupted. This disruption results in dysbiosis (imbalance in gut microbiota), neuroinflammation, and cognitive difficulties. This article briefly updates the link between TBI and GBA and the management of patients with TBI in hospital settings. A comprehensive understanding of the involvement of gut microbiota in regulating metabolic and immune functions will drive significant advancements in the treatment and rehabilitation of individuals affected by TBI.",
