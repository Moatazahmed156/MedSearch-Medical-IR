    "title": "Acute kidney injury in chronic liver disease: Causes and prevalence in a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a prevalent condition with significant systemic complications and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication that worsens prognosis. This prospective observational study, conducted from November 2019 to June 2021 at G.R. Medical College, Gwalior, included 100 CLD patients. The study found that 30% of patients developed AKI, with sepsis as the most common precipitating factor. Severe renal impairment (Stage 3 AKI) was present in 46.6% of AKI cases. Alcohol was the leading etiology of CLD and the timely diagnosis and management of AKI in CLD patients are essential to improving outcomes and reducing mortality.",
