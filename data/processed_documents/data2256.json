    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia, imposes a substantial societal burden. The persistent inadequacy of disease-modifying drugs targeting amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles suggests the contribution of alternative pathogenic mechanisms. A frequently overlooked aspect is cerebrovascular dysfunction, which may manifest early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Mounting evidence underscores the pivotal role of the apolipoprotein E gene, particularly the apolipoprotein ε4 allele as the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, in the cerebrovascular pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we examine the evidence elucidating the cerebrovascular impact of both central and peripheral apolipoprotein E on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We present a novel three-hit hypothesis, outlining potential mechanisms that shed light on the intricate relationship among different pathogenic events. Finally, we discuss prospective therapeutics targeting the cerebrovascular pathology associated with apolipoprotein E and explore their implications for future research endeavours.",
