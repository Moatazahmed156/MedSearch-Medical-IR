    "abstract": "The adult lung, a workhorse for gas exchange, is continually subjected to a barrage of assaults from the inhaled particles and pathogens. Hence, homeostatic maintenance is of paramount importance. Epithelial stem cells interact with their particular niche in the adult lung to orchestrate both natural tissue rejuvenation and robust post-injury regeneration. Advances in single-cell sequencing, lineage tracing, and living tissue imaging have deepened our understanding about stem cell heterogeneities, transition states, and specific cell lineage markers. In this review, we provided an overview of the known stem/progenitor cells and their subpopulations in different regions of the adult lung, and explored the regulatory networks in stem cells and their respective niche which collectively coordinated stem cell quiescence and regeneration states. We finally discussed relationships between dysregulated stem cell function and lung disease.",
