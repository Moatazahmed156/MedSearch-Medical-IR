    "abstract": "The storage and periodic voiding of urine in the lower urinary tract are regulated by a complex neural control system that includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic ganglia. Investigating the neuromodulation mechanisms of the lower urinary tract helps to deepen our understanding of urine storage and voiding processes, reveal the mechanisms underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction, and provide new strategies and insights for the treatment and management of related diseases. However, the current understanding of the neuromodulation mechanisms of the lower urinary tract is still limited, and further research methods are needed to elucidate its mechanisms and potential pathological mechanisms. This article provides an overview of the research progress in the functional study of the lower urinary tract system, as well as the key neural regulatory mechanisms during the micturition process. In addition, the commonly used research methods for studying the regulatory mechanisms of the lower urinary tract and the methods for evaluating lower urinary tract function in rodents are discussed. Finally, the latest advances and prospects of artificial intelligence in the research of neuromodulation mechanisms of the lower urinary tract are discussed. This includes the potential roles of machine learning in the diagnosis of lower urinary tract diseases and intelligent-assisted surgical systems, as well as the application of data mining and pattern recognition techniques in advancing lower urinary tract research. Our aim is to provide researchers with novel strategies and insights for the treatment and management of lower urinary tract dysfunction by conducting in-depth research and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the latest advancements in the neural regulation mechanisms of the lower urinary tract.",
