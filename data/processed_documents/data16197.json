    "title": "Emerging Health Needs in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A Population Health Framework.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic vulnerabilities and inequities across global health systems, emphasizing the urgent need for holistic, adaptive strategies in the post-pandemic era. This study introduces an integrated population health framework grounded in the One Health paradigm, addressing the complex interplay between human, animal, and environmental health. The proposed framework encompasses four key dimensions-social governance, behavioral control, health system adjustments, and environmental governance-designed to align health priorities across sectors and scales. By incorporating multi-sectoral collaboration, evidence-based risk factor analysis, and multidimensional health indicators, this model offers actionable strategies for enhancing health equity, system resilience, and long-term sustainability. The framework is especially relevant to addressing the dual burden of chronic disease and emerging infectious threats, while simultaneously responding to climate-related and socio-environmental risks. Our findings support the need for integrated governance and cross-disciplinary partnerships to advance planetary health objectives and inform national and global health policy.",
