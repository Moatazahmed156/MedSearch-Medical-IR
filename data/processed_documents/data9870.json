    "title": "Incidence and risk factors of contrast-associated acute kidney injury in patients hospitalised after contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the emergency department.",
    "abstract": "Since 1930 it has been accepted that intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent as part of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) imaging can induce a contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). For the last 10 years, studies have investigated this iatrogenia. However, those works didn't concern patient hospitalised after emergency department (ED) visit. This study assessed the CA-AKI incidence and risk factors in patients hospitalised after a CE-CT in ED. This was a monocentric retrospective study, conducted in a University Hospital ED (Beaujon Hospital) between 2019 and 2022. Patients over 16 years old who received a CE-CT and two serum creatinine dosages, one pre-CT and one post-CT (2 to 7 days later), were included. Risk factors and protective factors of CA-AKI as well as population characteristics were analysed. After studying 5079 enhanced CT-scans, 1463 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of CA-AKI was 4.1%. The associated risk factors were: hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.76-6.43)), CKD grade 4-5 (aOR = 5.89, 95% CI (1.39-24.95)), waiting time before CT (aOR = 3.36, 95% CI (1.76-6.43)). Ongoing treatment by metformin was found to be a protective factor (aOR = 0.26, 95% CI (0.06-1.12)). Our findings suggest that only hypertension and stage 4-5 CKD significantly increase the risk of CA-AKI. Consequently, CT imaging should not be unnecessarily delayed when clinically justified, as prompt diagnosis could help limit morbidity and mortality. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 22 July 2025 (NCT07091656).",
