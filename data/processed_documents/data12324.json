    "abstract": "HER2-directed treatments for HER2-overexpressing (HER2-OE; immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+/2+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed. DESTINY-Lung03 is an open-label, multi-arm, phase 1b study. Part 1 evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, 4.4 or 5.4 mg/kg) plus durvalumab (1120 mg) and cisplatin (60 or 75 mg/m dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adverse events (AEs: Arms 1A and 1B). Secondary endpoints: safety (Arm 1D) and efficacy (all arms). At data cutoff (April 1, 2024), 11, 24, and 36 patients received treatment in Arms 1A, 1B, and 1D, respectively. DLTs reported in Arm 1A: febrile neutropenia (n=1; Grade [G] 5; 4.4 mg/kg / 1120 mg / 60 mg/m Data confirm activity of T-DXd monotherapy in pretreated HER2-OE NSCLC, but do not support T-DXd plus durvalumab and platinum chemotherapy use in this population.",
