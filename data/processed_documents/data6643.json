    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a deadly disease. Lymph node staging is the most important prognostic factor, and lymphatic drainage of the lung is complex. Major advances have been made in this field over the last several decades, but there is much left to understand and improve upon. Herein, we review the history of the lymphatic system and the creation of lymph node maps, the evolution of tumor, node, and metastasis lung cancer classification, the importance of lung cancer staging, techniques for lymph node dissection, and our recommendations regarding a minimum number of nodes to sample during pulmonary resection.",
