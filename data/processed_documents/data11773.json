    "abstract": "Responses to palliative radiotherapy (RT) for metastatic lesions vary among patients, and molecular determinants of radiosensitivity remain unclear. This study investigated genomic features associated with local progression-free survival (LPFS) in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with palliative RT. Forty-four patients who underwent next-generation sequencing of 523 cancer-related genes were retrospectively analyzed. The biologically effective dose (BED) was calculated using an α/β ratio of 3 Gy, and local progression was defined as recurrence or progression within the irradiated field. A total of 60 metastatic lesions, predominantly in bone (68.3%), were evaluated. Higher BED (≥88 Gy) was significantly associated with longer LPFS (",
