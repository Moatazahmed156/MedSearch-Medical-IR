    "abstract": "Biological membranes define cellular and organelle boundaries, and perform vital functions, providing transport, recognition, signaling, and interaction with other cells. These membranes are majorly composed of lipid bilayers and membrane proteins. Membrane proteins perform most membrane functions. Based on their localization, they are classified as integral and peripheral proteins. In this overview, we provide basic information about membrane proteins structure, conformational dynamics, and functions, and outline the methodologies used to produce highly-pure functional membrane proteins for",
