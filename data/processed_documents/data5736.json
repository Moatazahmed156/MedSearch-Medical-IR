    "abstract": "Given the complex relationship between the gut microbiome and chronic kidney disease (CKD), exploring the potential role and scope of microbiota-targeted therapies in pediatric CKD is highly relevant. We aim to provide an overview of gut-targeted therapeutic strategies, including nutritional interventions (fiber, phytochemicals, fermented foods, and traditional Chinese medicines), probiotics, synbiotics, oral absorbents, and fecal microbial transplantation. Enhancing physical activity and preventing constipation are additional strategies that may promote gut microbiome health. In a uremic environment, gut microbiota-targeted therapies could potentially rebalance the gut microbiota, improve gut barrier function, decrease uremic toxin concentrations, enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and reduce inflammation. While research in adult CKD patients has provided insights into these approaches, there are limited data in children with CKD. This review aims to summarize potential targeted therapies for restoring a balanced gut microbiota, emphasizing the need for studies that evaluate their effects on clinical outcomes in pediatric CKD.",
