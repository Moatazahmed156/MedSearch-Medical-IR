    "abstract": "The cause and pathophysiology of low back pain are discussed in detail. Imaging studies of the lumbar spine-inclusive discography can help in detecting the originator of pain. The common treatment for low back pain is conservative. Only patients who fail this approach or who develop neurologic deficits benefit from lumbar surgery. A more aggressive treatment is chosen for patients with infections or tumors of the lumbar spine. Different treatment options are explained concerning the different diseases leading to low back pain.",
