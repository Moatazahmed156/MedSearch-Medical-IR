    "abstract": "BackgroundAir pollution has been implicated in cognitive decline and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD). Inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), may mediate these associations, but causal evidence remains limited.ObjectiveTo examine the associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and cognitive performance, evaluate the causal effects of air pollutants on genetically predicted AD/ADRD risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), and assess CRP as a potential mediator.MethodsWe conducted observational analyses among 7087 older adults from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) to evaluate associations between long-term PM exposure and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Two-sample MR using GWAS summary statistics was performed to estimate the causal effects of PM",
