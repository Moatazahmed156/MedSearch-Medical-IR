Electronic Scopus and Pubmed databases were searched for articles on the studied topic. The review included original articles, research, and official recommendations from medical associations.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Conclusions: Side effects of antidepressants can reduce treatment adherence and delay recovery. Therefore, it is extremely important to consider possible side effects when choosing a therapy. While there is no perfect antidepressant that works quickly and is completely free of side effects, newer antidepressants are safer, better tolerated, and associated with lower rates of treatment failure. Most side effects occur as a consequence of the basic mechanism of action of the drugs. Therefore, it is important to understand the neurobiology of side effects, their frequency and risks, ways to prevent them or use them to your advantage resources.",
