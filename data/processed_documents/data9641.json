    "title": "Hydrogel composite nanomaterials for diabetic wound treatment.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is slowly becoming more common over the past few years. One of the most disabling effects of diabetes is chronic skin ulcers. This is because certain materials have unique physicochemical properties that make them very useful for treating diabetic wounds. The three-dimensional network structure of hydrogels allows them to absorb large amounts of water. Their ability to bind water better, hold drugs effectively, and release drugs continuously is superior. Nanomaterials, particularly helpful in preventing bacterial infections and diabetic wounds caused by oxidative stress, are defined by at least one dimension measuring under 100 nanometers. Their unique qualities include antimicrobial action, facilitation of cell migration and proliferation, drug delivery systems, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This review delineates the properties and classifications of hydrogels, emphasizing their benefits as wound dressings. It then discusses the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and their applications in wound healing. The main focus is on the basics of hydrogel-nanomaterial composites, their preparation techniques, and the synergistic benefits of their combination as wound dressings. The utilization of hydrogel nanocomposites in diabetic wound treatment is elucidated, and prospective research avenues are suggested to offer novel insights for clinical management.",
