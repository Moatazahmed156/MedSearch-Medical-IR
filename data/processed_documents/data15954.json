    "abstract": "Intrabacterial drug accumulation, mediated by the bacterial permeability barrier, efflux, and intrabacterial drug metabolism, is of general significance to the interaction between small molecules and bacteria. For example, the ability of a small molecule to accumulate within a bacterium influences its ability to serve as a chemical probe of an intracellular protein target and/or its efficacy as an antibacterial drug discovery entity. A general method to quantitatively interrogate both intrabacterial drug accumulation and metabolism (IBDM) is presented for Gram-negative bacteria and exemplified with ",
