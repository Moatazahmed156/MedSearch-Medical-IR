    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia and one which may cause pilot incapacitation. In many cases there may be no more than one episode and there will be no organic heart disease. Prediction of the risk of recurrence is not possible. Atrial fibrillation in both paroxysmal and persistent forms should be disqualifying for Class I or unrestricted Class III certification. Individuals with a single episode of atrial fibrillation related to a reversible toxic cause but with no evidence of organic heart disease could be considered for restricted duty subject to echocardiographic and ambulatory electrocardiographic follow up. Atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia should disbar from aircrew duties.",
