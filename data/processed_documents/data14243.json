    "title": "Breaking the Cycle: How Immune Reprogramming and Modulation Are Redefining Osteoarthritis Care.",
    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), once considered merely a mechanical degenerative condition, is now recognized as a disease driven and sustained by immunological dysregulation, in which dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses facilitate chronic joint deterioration. This paradigm shift underscores the crucial role of immune effector cells, especially pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, in driving synovial inflammation and cartilage matrix deterioration. Recent evidence of autoantibodies and ectopic synovial lymphoid formations indicates an autoimmune component in some subsets of OA patients. Innovative therapeutics, including hydrogel microspheres, have demonstrated in preclinical models the ability to reprogram M1 macrophages into an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, achieving reprogramming rates of up to 88.5%, thereby diminishing inflammation and maintaining cartilage integrity. Nonetheless, significant clinical obstacles persist: individual patient tailoring, accurate targeting, and sustained treatment efficacy. This review addresses recent findings on the immunological foundations of OA, assesses the viability of immune reprogramming approaches, and delineates essential research objectives necessary for clinical application. A comprehensive understanding of these immune reprogramming mechanisms has immediate translational and therapeutic ramifications, including opportunities for disease-modifying immunotherapies, enhanced patient stratification, and predictive therapy algorithms. Employing sophisticated techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and tailored immune regulation, immune-centric treatments could convert OA from a chronic, degenerative condition into a treatable, potentially reversible ailment, ushering in a new era of treatment and optimism for millions.",
