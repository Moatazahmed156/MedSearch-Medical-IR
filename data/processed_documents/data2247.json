    "abstract": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is one of the cardinal pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Although the neurotoxic effects of Aβ has been extensively studied, recent studies have revealed that it may also have protective effects. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of Aβ in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. An in-depth and comprehensive understanding of Aβ will provide us with a broader perspective on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
