    "title": "Micro/Nanorobots in Wound Healing: Bridging the Gap from Concept to Clinical Translation.",
    "abstract": "Chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure sores, pose a significant clinical challenge due to ongoing inflammation, biofilm development, and impaired tissue regeneration. Standard wound care methods often fail to address these complex barriers, highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Nanorobotics has emerged as a groundbreaking platform, enabling programmable, multifunctional systems capable of active navigation, biofilm penetration, modulation of the microenvironment, and targeted therapeutic delivery. This review systematically covers the design principles and functional components of micro-/nanorobots, including propulsion techniques, sensing and actuation mechanisms, and biomimetic surface modifications. We also examine their therapeutic potential in wound healing, focusing on drug delivery optimization, biofilm disruption, reduction of oxidative stress, immune regulation, and tissue regeneration support. The integration of nanorobotics with intelligent wound care systems offers real-time monitoring and closed-loop interventions, initiating a new era of \"smart wound management.\" Finally, we address translational challenges such as biosafety, large-scale manufacturing, and regulatory pathways, and provide perspectives on future advancements toward clinically practical, intelligent nanorobotic wound therapies.",
