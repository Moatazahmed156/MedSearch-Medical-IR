    "abstract": "Current therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) are often limited by drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and tumor recurrence. To address these challenges, a multifunctional nanosystem for enhanced drug delivery was developed. The system is composed of cashew gum nanoparticles (CGNPs) coloaded with oxaliplatin (OXA) and retinoic acid (RA), combined with magnetic core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs). Following synthesis and characterization, ",
