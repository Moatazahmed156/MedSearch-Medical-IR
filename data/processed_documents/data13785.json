    "title": "Current and future treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease primarily targeting the joints, leading to progressive inflammation, joint damage, and functional impairment. The pathogenesis of RA involves a complex interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as smoking, which together drive the dysregulated activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. The introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs marked a pivotal advancement in RA management, transforming the disease from a debilitating chronic condition into a treatable disorder. Ongoing progress in basic and clinical research has identified novel therapeutic targets, paving the way for precision medicine tailored to individual patient needs, with the ultimate goal of achieving long-term remission. This review outlines current treatment options and summarizes key treatment guidelines established by major rheumatology societies. Additionally, it highlights emerging therapies, including selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and epigenetic modulators. Finally, novel cell-based therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells and T cell engagers, which hold the potential to enable durable, drug-free remission. These current and emerging treatments will help further optimize RA management and improve patient outcomes.",
