    "abstract": "The oral hamartoma is a unique presentation of head and neck tumors with nonspecific etiology and atypical histopathological presentation. Oral hamartomas generally present as smooth, painless, pinkish masses, histologically comprising neural and vascular components intermingled in connective tissue stroma. The presence of a neurovascular hamartoma (NVH) within the oral cavity is truly a rare entity, scarcely reported in the literature. These tumors are difficult to diagnose and are most commonly benign with good prognosis and clinical outcome. Here, we present a case of oral NVH of the palate in a pediatric patient.\n    \n\n\n          How to cite this article:\n        \n      \n      Sandeep V, Vidhyadhari P, Rajesh N, et al.
