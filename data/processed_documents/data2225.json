    "abstract": "The current knowledge of the neuropathology, neurochemistry and genetics of Alzheimer's disease is reviewed. The hallmarks of neuropathology, namely neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are described. The search for the aetiological agent(s) and a therapeutic strategy are briefly described and the location of a genetic locus for Alzheimer's disease on chromosome 21 is discussed. Future directions for research are suggested.",
