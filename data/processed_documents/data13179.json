    "abstract": "A variety of neurocognitive/motor operations underlie successful performance on the traditional paper/pencil Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B). The current research analyzed a panel of six novel process metrics to assess how neurocognitive and motor operations on a digital version of the TMT-B (dTMT-B) can dissociate patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus normal cognition (NC); and relations between paper/pencil neuropsychological tests. Using a digital neuropsychological battery of episodic and working memory tests, memory clinic patients (n = 58) were classified into groups presenting with MCI versus NC. The panel of dTMT-B process metrics included (1) total time to completion; (2) hit duration or time spent with the pen inside target circles; (3) total number of pen strokes; (4) distance or the length of an imaginary line connecting all targets; (5) velocity or the speed pen strokes were drawn; and (6) efficiency or the straightness of pen strokes. MCI patients were slightly older and less educated than NC patients; and scored lower on the MMSE. MANOVA found slower total duration (p <0.007; η These data suggest that it may be possible to fashion separate indices measuring dTMT-B time-based versus selected motor operations. Additional research is needed to see how well these novel dTMT-B indices can flag emergent cognitive impairment.",
