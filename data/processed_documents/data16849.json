    "title": "Deleterious, protein-altering variants in GSPT2 are putatively associated with an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, language impairment, autism and epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 6% of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders are predicted to be X-linked, and the GSPT2 gene, located at Xp11.22, has not yet been associated with any Mendelian disease. To establish genotype-phenotype associations between GSPT2 and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), clinical investigations were performed in unrelated individuals, genomic and functional studies were conducted on the participants' blood and heterologous cell system. We described six individuals from six unrelated families carrying hemizygous variants in GSPT2 with ID, DSD, ASD, epilepsy or abnormal fetal neurodevelopment. Structural molecular modelling revealed significant deleterious effects of the identified variants. GSPT2 is preferentially enriched in the brain and cerebellum compared to other tissues. GSPT2-deficient H4 neuroglioma cells slow down the proliferation and downregulate the expression of cell cycle related genes. Transcriptomics revealed that GABAergic and calcium signalling related genes were significantly downregulated in GSPT2-deficient cells. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, RT-PCR analysis verified the marked downregulation of critical genes (CACNA1B, etc.) in GSPT2-knockout cells and further confirmed these findings with proteomic profiling. Our data suggest a putative GSPT2-related X-linked NDDs through dysregulation of cell cycle progression and calcium/GABAergic signaling pathways.",
