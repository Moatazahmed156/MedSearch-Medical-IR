    "title": "Association between flood exposure and chronic kidney disease: A nationwide cross-sectional study in China.",
    "abstract": "Flooding has become more frequent and intense due to climate change, yet its long-term health impacts, especially on chronic kidney disease (CKD), remain underexplored. This study examines the association between long-term flood exposure and CKD among adults in China using data from 47,204 participants in a nationally representative survey. Flood exposure was defined as satellite-detected inundation occurring within 10 km of participants' residences during the one to seven years preceding the survey. CKD was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min/1.73 m",
