    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis was conducted on 140 hospitalized children with confirmed MPP (2014-2024). Patients were grouped as MPP alone ( Children with MPP+Hi showed the highest hs-CRP levels (23.93 ± 21.26 mg/L), longest fever duration, and longest hospital stay. The MPP+influenza group had significantly lower WBC (7.25 ± 3.50 × 10 Coinfection type influenced inflammatory and haematological patterns in children with MPP: Hi coinfection produced stronger inflammatory responses, while influenza coinfection showed viral-associated lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Routine laboratory parameters may support earlier recognition of coinfections and guide more targeted clinical management.",
