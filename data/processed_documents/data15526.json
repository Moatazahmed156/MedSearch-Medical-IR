    "abstract": "Active tuberculosis disease (ATB) remains feared in patients treated with TNF inhibitors. For that reason, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is currently performed before the start of treatment. Therapeutic patient education (TPE) should consequently help reduce the risk of infection during treatment. We report the case of a 19-year-old female patient hospitalized for disseminated tuberculosis. She had been treated for two years with adalimumab for Crohn's disease. Screening for LTBI had been performed before the initiation of anti-TNF treatment and was negative. Three months after returning from a four-month study trip to South Africa, the patient nevertheless developed disseminated tuberculosis and was repeatedly hospitalized. The disease was at once pulmonary, lymphatic, ocular, and splenic. Antituberculosis treatment consisted of quadruple therapy for two months followed by dual therapy for an additional 10 months. The patient was disabled for one year and suffered some radiological sequelae. Traveling to a country with high tuberculosis endemicity is a risk factor for ATB in patients undergoing anti-TNF therapy. Antibioprophylaxis may have been considered prior to the trip.",
