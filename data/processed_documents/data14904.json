    "title": "Apigenin as a multifunctional flavone against liver fibrosis: mechanistic insights into its modulation of key fibrogenic signalling pathways.",
    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathological condition characterised by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components, primarily driven by chronic liver injury and activation of hepatic stellate cells. This pathological remodelling disrupts hepatic architecture and function, and if left untreated, may advance to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma, a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Flavonoids are a diverse group of polyphenolic compounds found in plants, known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and hepatoprotective properties. Their beneficial effects on liver health have been widely explored in preclinical and clinical studies. Apigenin (4',5,7-Trihydroxyflavone) is a naturally occurring flavonoid (specifically a flavone) widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and herbs, especially in parsley, celery, chamomile, and oranges. It has gained significant scientific attention due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties. Preclinical studies demonstrate that apigenin mitigates fibrogenesis by attenuating oxidative stress, suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibiting HSC activation. Mechanistically, it modulates multiple signalling pathways and molecular targets such as TGF-β1/Smad, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, PPARα, GSK3β, MAPK, MLKL, Nrf-2/Keap1, and NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby exerting a multitargeted antifibrotic response. Furthermore, apigenin's ability to restore redox homeostasis and regulate apoptotic signalling underscores its therapeutic potential. Considering the potential of apigenin in modulating these mediators, the present study was conceptualised to study the mechanistic interplay underlying its anti-fibrotic effects. By investigating these interconnected pathways, this study will provide foundational insights that will enable future researchers to address existing gaps and further elucidate apigenin's potential in liver fibrosis.",
