    "abstract": "Inhibition of ERCC1/XPF, a heterodimeric enzyme complex with endonuclease activity that participates in the repair of DNA inter- and intrastrand cross-links, is expected to make cells sensitive to DNA damage by platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Here we report on repurposing a clinically used antimalaria drug, pyronaridine (PYD), as a novel inhibitor of ERCC1/XPF for the sensitization of colorectal cancer cells (CRC) to platinum drugs. We have developed a liposomal formulation of PYD to make the chemosensitizing activity of this ERCC1/XPF inhibitor more specific to the tumor site. Liposomal PYD was optimized by changing the lipid composition and the pH gradient system within the liposomes. Prepared formulations were characterized for their average diameter, PYD encapsulation, and ",
