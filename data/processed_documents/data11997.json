    "title": "Clinicopathologic Features of Six Patients With Metastatic Carcinoma to the Uterine Cervix.",
    "abstract": "Metastasis to the female genital tract is a rare event and presents a significant diagnostic challenge. Among the organs of the female genital tract, the uterine cervix is an exceptionally uncommon site for metastasis, likely due to its limited vascular perfusion and abundant fibrous tissue. The most common clinical presentation is abnormal vaginal bleeding, seen in 62% to 75% of patients. Accurate identification of cervical tumors, whether primary or metastatic, is necessary for proper treatment and prognostic assessment. In this case series, we present the clinicopathologic features of six patients with metastatic cancer to the uterine cervix encountered over a 5-year period.",
