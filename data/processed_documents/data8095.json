    "abstract": "Many risk factors for dementia, identified from observational studies, are potentially modifiable. This raises the possibility that targeting key modifiable dementia risk factors may reduce the prevalence of dementia, which has led to the development of dementia risk reduction and prevention strategies, such as intervention trials or dementia prevention guidelines. However, what has rarely been considered in the studies that inform these strategies is the extent to which modifiable dementia risk factors can (1) be identified by individuals, and (2) be readily modified by individuals. Characteristics of modifiable dementia risk factors such as readiness of identification and targeting, as well as when they should be targeted, can influence the design, or success of strategies for reducing dementia risk. This review aims to develop a framework for classifying the degree of modifiability of dementia risk factors for research studies. The extent to which these modifiable dementia risk factors could be modified by an individual seeking to reduce their dementia risk is determined, as well as the resources that might be needed for both risk factor identification and modification, and whether modification may be optimal in early-life (aged <45 years), midlife (aged 45-65 years) or late-life (aged >65 years). Finally, barriers that could influence the ability of an individual to engage in risk factor modification and, ultimately, dementia risk reduction are discussed.",
