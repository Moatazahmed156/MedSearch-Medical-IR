    "abstract": "T cell activation requires extracellular stimulatory signals that are mainly mediated by T cell receptor (TCR) complexes. The TCR recognizes antigens on major histocompatibility complex molecules with the cooperation of CD4 or CD8 coreceptors. After recognition, TCR-induced signaling cascades that propagate signals via various molecules and second messengers are induced. Consequently, many features of T cell-mediated immune responses are determined by these intracellular signaling cascades. Furthermore, differences in the magnitude of TCR signaling direct T cells toward distinct effector linages. Therefore, stringent regulation of T cell activation is crucial for T cell homeostasis and proper immune responses. Dysregulation of TCR signaling can result in anergy or autoimmunity. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the pathways that govern how the TCR complex transmits signals into cells and the roles of effector molecules that are involved in these pathways.",
