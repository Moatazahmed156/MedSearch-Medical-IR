    "abstract": "As the primary surgical procedure of treating and preventing cervical lymph node metastasis in head and neck cancers, neck dissection (ND) have increasingly becoming standardized and reasonable since the past hundred years. However, the preoperative uncertainty of cervical lymph node metastasis for patient with head neck cancer, whether perform ND and the dissection region often confuse the surgeons. Provide a currently standardized ND operation manner according to the metastatic characteristics and operative wound degree as a reference to surgeons may facilitate the therapeutic and prevent effects on patients with head and neck cancer.",
