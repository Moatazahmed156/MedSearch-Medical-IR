    "abstract": "The development of T cell in the thymus and the activation of mature T cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues require T cell to make adaptive responses to signaling molecules of environment. The activation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway could be induced by the interaction of the TCR and its co-receptor CD4 and CD8 with MHC/peptide complex. This process involves co-stimulatory molecules and signals mediated by cytokine receptors, which eventually leads to the occurrence of T cell immune response. The Src-family kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Fyn) are expressed in T cells and serve as the signaling molecules that are activated downstream of TCR. These signaling molecules play key roles in development, positive selection, and peripheral maintenance of naive T cells and lymphopenia-induced proliferation of peripheral T cells. Both Lck and Fyn are required for each of these TCR-based signaling pathways, and Lck seems to be the major contributor, while Fyn can only supplement some functions of Lck. In this review, we discussed the mechanisms by which these two proteins perform functions in T cell development based on our current understanding.",
