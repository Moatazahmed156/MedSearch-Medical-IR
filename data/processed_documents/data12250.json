    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), offering potential for risk stratification and treatment optimization in the postoperative setting. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prognostic value of postoperative ctDNA detection for recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with surgically resected NSCLC. We systematically searched multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, identifying 1,640 initial records. After screening and eligibility assessment, 13 studies encompassing 1,309 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Immediate postoperative ctDNA detection (4 studies, n = 556) demonstrated a hazard ratio of 6.41 (95% CI: 4.18-9.83, P < 0.00001, I Postoperative ctDNA detection independently predicts prognosis in resected NSCLC, consistently indicating recurrence risk and guiding adjuvant therapy decisions.",
