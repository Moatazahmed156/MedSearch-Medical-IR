    "abstract": "Hypertensive heart disease includes the development of diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction. The development of heart failure can occur because of complications of ischemic heart disease or from progression of diastolic dysfunction to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction degenerating to a dilated heart with systolic dysfunction or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Hypertension clinical trials have shown that the treatment of hypertension can prevent the development of heart failure. In addition, lifestyle modification with exercise and weight loss can improve diastolic function and reduce the risk for heart failure.",
