    "abstract": "Cervical lymph node metastasis is an important determinant of cancer stage and the selection of an appropriate treatment plan for patients with head and neck cancer. Therefore, metastatic cervical lymph nodes should be effectively differentiated from lymphoma, tuberculous lymphadenitis, and other benign lymphadenopathies. The aim of this work is to describe the performance of Doppler ultrasound and superb microvascular imaging (SMI) in evaluating blood flow information of cervical lymph nodes. In addition, the features of flow imaging in metastatic lymph nodes, lymphoma, and tuberculous lymphadenitis were described. Compared with Doppler ultrasound, SMI, the latest blood flow imaging technology, could detect more blood flow signals because the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SMI in the diagnosis of cervical lymph node disease were higher. This article summarizes the value of Doppler ultrasound and SMI in evaluating cervical lymph node diseases and focuses on the diagnostic performance of SMI.",
