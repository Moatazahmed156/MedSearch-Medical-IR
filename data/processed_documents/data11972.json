    "title": "Enhanced in vitro photodynamic therapy for triple-negative breast cancer by pheophorbide a-encapsulated chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Current treatment strategies typically involve surgical resection and chemotherapy, both of which are often associated with significant adverse effects. As an alternative, photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a minimally invasive approach to selectively target tumor cells. In this work, PDT was evaluated using pheophorbide a (Pa) as a photosensitizer. To enhance its therapeutic efficacy, Pa was encapsulated in ionically crosslinked chitosan/tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticles synthesized from chitosan subjected to various pre-treatments were compared in terms of their physicochemical properties. The optimized Pa-loaded chitosan/TPP nanoparticles (PaCNPs) exhibited enhanced singlet oxygen (",
