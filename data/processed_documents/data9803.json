    "title": "Cardiovascular risk factors and life expectancy in India: A retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of adult mortality in India. Hence, we retrospectively analyzed electronic records of 4,812 adults from two tertiary hospitals to quantify major CVD risk factors and their association with survival and estimated remaining life expectancy (LE) at age 40 using Chiang's abridged life table with Sample Registration System (SRS) background rates. Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and obesity were frequent (≥20% each). Adjusted Cox models showed stepwise higher mortality with increasing risk-factor count (≥3 vs 0: HR 1.92; 95% CI 1.49-2.48; p<0.001). Estimated LE at 40 declined from 39.6 (0 factors) to 33.2 years (≥3). Findings underscore intensified primary prevention.",
