    "abstract": "The overwhelming majority of ovarian cysts in pediatric and adolescent girls are physiologic; however, large simple and complex ovarian lesions often require surgical intervention due to the increased risk of neoplasia. In this review article, we discuss the preoperative evaluation and intraoperative management of large ovarian neoplasms. We review the current literature regarding long term ovarian function and fertility, rates of recurrence and residual disease, and novel surgical approaches. Managing large ovarian neoplasms in the pediatric and adolescent population requires careful preoperative and intraoperative care to optimally resect neoplasia while maximizing fertility and minimizing pain.",
