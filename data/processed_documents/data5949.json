    "abstract": "Rat stomach provided an excellent substrate for immunofluorescence testing of gastric parietal cell autoantibodies in 65 human sera. The results of similar tests using human stomach corresponded closely in the 42 cases examined. The rat stomach had some advantage over human stomach in its ready availability in the fresh state, its occasional brighter staining reactions, and its avoidance of non-specific staining by the sandwich immunofluorescence technique.",
