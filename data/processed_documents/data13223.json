Previous work has associated regional hypo-perfusion with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression prior to brain atrophy We selected a subset of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) subjects (Table 1), with ground-truth diagnostic label (cognitively normal CN, mild cognitive impairment MCI, and AD). For MCI subjects with longitudinal data, we defined stable-MCI (s-MCI) as never converting to AD, and converting-MCI (c-MCI) as converting within 12, 24 or 36 months. ASL images were processed using the qasl pipeline (Quantified Imaging, London, UK), which follows the principles outlined by Alsop Results are summarised in Table 2, with ROC curves and confusion matrices in Figure 1. Classifiers distinguished between AD vs. CN or MCI with AUCs of 0.957 [95% CI: 0.904, 0.994] and 0.936 [0.864, 0.988], respectively, both achieving specificity of 0.98. CN vs. MCI classification was less performant (AUC 0.702 [0.599, 0.801]). For c-MCI vs. s-MCI, AUC exceeded 0.9 for all timeframes. We demonstrated that ASL measures could predict clinical diagnosis and disease progression, outperforming both PET",
