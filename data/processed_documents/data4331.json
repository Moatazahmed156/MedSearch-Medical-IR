    "abstract": "Excess reactive oxygen species production and free radical formation can lead to oxidative stress that can damage cells, tissues, and organs. Cellular oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between ROS production and antioxidants. This imbalance can lead to malfunction or structure modification of major cellular molecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNAs. During oxidative stress conditions, DNA and protein structure modifications can lead to various diseases. Various antioxidant-specific gene expression and signal transduction pathways are activated during oxidative stress to maintain homeostasis and to protect organs from oxidative injury and damage. The liver is more vulnerable to oxidative conditions than other organs. Antioxidants, antioxidant-specific enzymes, and the regulation of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) genes can act against chronic oxidative stress in the liver. ARE-mediated genes can act as the target site for averting/preventing liver diseases caused by oxidative stress. Identification of these ARE genes as markers will enable the early detection of liver diseases caused by oxidative conditions and help develop new therapeutic interventions. This literature review is focused on antioxidant-specific gene expression upon oxidative stress, the factors responsible for hepatic oxidative stress, liver response to redox signaling, oxidative stress and redox signaling in various liver diseases, and future aspects.",
