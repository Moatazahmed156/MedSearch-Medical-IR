    "abstract": "Dementia and heart failure (HF) are two major epidemics that adversely influence each other, yet few studies have explored strategies to prevent cognitive decline in HF. The Reducing Cognitive impairment by management of Heart Failure as a Modifiable Risk Factor (Cog-HF) trial is a randomized controlled trial assessing whether a disease management program (DMP) compared to usual care can mitigate cognitive decline in HF patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This report describes the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in Cog-HF and their comparability to recent Japanese HF registries. Patients with HF and MCI, defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <26, were recruited for Cog-HF. Baseline characteristics of patients in Cog-HF were compared to those of the FRAGILE-HF, JROADHF, and CURE-HF cohorts. Among 176 participants (mean age 79 ± 6 years; 53 % men; body mass index 22.3 ± 3.4 kg/m Patients in Cog-HF were similar to those in recent HF registries and were receiving guideline-recommended HF treatment, supporting the external validity of future trial findings.",
