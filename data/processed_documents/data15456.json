    "title": "Mycobacterial Spindle Cell Pseudotumor in an 18-Year-Old Female With Congenital HIV: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Mycobacterial spindle cell pseudotumor (MSP) is an uncommon granulomatous inflammation often found in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV. This case report discusses an 18-year-old female with congenital HIV, who presented with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and noteworthy lymphadenopathy. Imaging studies identified lobulated masses, and a core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MSP, revealing spindle-shaped histiocytes and acid-fast bacilli. Additionally, we reviewed nine MSP cases documented since 2017.",
