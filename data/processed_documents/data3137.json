    "abstract": "Surgical interventions, such as laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), are frequently associated with significant weight loss. However, the initiation and maintenance of this weight reduction are multifaceted processes influenced by genetic, psychological, behavioral, dietary, and metabolic factors. This review examined the role of metabolic hormones, specifically serotonin, in sustaining weight loss post-LSG. A systematic evaluation of six research articles obtained from Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane was conducted, focusing on the role of serotonin in weight loss maintenance. We included randomized controlled trials involving adults over 18 years. Studies lacking an intensive weight regulation approach were excluded. Information was systematically extracted and analyzed from the selected studies, with data on intervention and control groups summarized in tables to compare outcomes one year post-LSG. The findings revealed a complex interplay between serotonin and its role in weight maintenance after sleeve gastrectomy. While some studies demonstrated successful weight loss maintenance with serotonin intervention, the systematic review found no association between serotonin and weight loss maintenance. Factors beyond serotonin levels, including individual motivation, behavioral strategies, and physical activity, were identified as crucial contributors to sustained weight loss. While the results may not demonstrate a recognizable association between serotonin and weight loss maintenance, the significance of this review lies in its contribution to the existing body of knowledge. By synthesizing current evidence, the study adds a nuanced perspective to understanding factors influencing post-LSG outcomes.",
