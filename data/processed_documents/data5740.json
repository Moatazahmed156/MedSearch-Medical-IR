    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a prevalent condition, impacting nearly one-fifth of the global population. Despite the availability of various clinical treatments, each comes with inherent limitations, and few offer a complete cure, resulting in a significant social and economic burden. Therefore, it is important to determine the pathogenesis and causes of chronic pain. Numerous studies have shown a close link between the intestinal microflora and chronic pain. The gut microbiota can exert their effects on chronic pain through both central and peripheral mechanisms and is able to communicate with the brain through its own components or metabolites. They also can regulate chronic pain by affecting pro- and anti-inflammatory cells. This review is aimed at reviewing the connection between gut flora and different types of chronic pain, including visceral pain, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, musculoskeletal pain, migraine, and chronic cancer pain; exploring the central and peripheral mechanisms of the influence of gut flora on chronic pain; and attempting to provide novel treatment options for chronic pain, that is, the gut microbiota can be regulated by probiotics, fecal microbial transplantation, and natural products to treat chronic pain. By examining the intricate relationship between gut flora and chronic pain, the review sought to pave the way for new treatment strategies that target the gut microbiota, offering hope for more effective pain management.",
