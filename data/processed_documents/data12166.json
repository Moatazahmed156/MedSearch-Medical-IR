    "abstract": "Nucleotide substitutions are common in cancer cells, and they occur in both protein coding regions and non-coding regions (5' and 3' UTRs and introns). Although substitutions in non-coding regions have the potential to alter gene expression, it is the alteration of coding regions that affects protein function and has the most drastic effect on cellular transformation. Mutations in certain genes (e.g., ",
