    "abstract": "Cell therapy has been identified as an effective method to regenerate damaged tissue. Adult stem cells, also known as somatic stem cells or resident stem cells, are a rare population of undifferentiated cells, located within a differentiated organ, in a specialized structure, called a niche, which maintains the microenvironments that regulate the growth and development of adult stem cells. The adult stem cells are self-renewing, clonogenic, and multipotent in nature, and their main role is to maintain the tissue homeostasis. They can be activated to proliferate and differentiate into the required type of cells, upon the loss of cells or injury to the tissue. Adult stem cells have been identified in many tissues including blood, intestine, skin, muscle, brain, and heart. Extensive preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the structural and functional regeneration capabilities of these adult stem cells, such as bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, resident adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and umbilical cord stem cells. In this review, we focus on the human therapies, utilizing adult stem cells for their regenerative capabilities in the treatment of cardiac, brain, pancreatic, and eye disorders.",
