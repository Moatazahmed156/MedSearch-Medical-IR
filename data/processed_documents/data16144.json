    "abstract": "Two related families of 4-aminopiperidine compounds active against SARS-CoV-2 in the micromolar range were discovered by screening the CSIC Chemical library. A medicinal chemistry programme was completed to optimize these series. Seventy-four derivatives of the early hits were synthesized which allowed to develop SAR studies and identify new hit compounds with low micromolar in vitro antiviral activity (EC",
