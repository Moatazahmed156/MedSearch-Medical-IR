    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), affecting 25-30% of adults globally, is strongly associated with depression, compounding morbidity and mortality. Despite their bidirectional relationship, tools to identify MASLD patients at high depression risk remain limited. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for depression in MASLD using nationally representative data. Using 2017-2023 NHANES data, 6,107 MASLD participants were analyzed. Depression was defined as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores ≥10. LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation identified predictors, followed by multivariable logistic regression to construct a nomogram. Model performance was evaluated via area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Ten predictors were retained: younger age, female gender, never-married status, low family poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), smoking, diabetes, arthritis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and platelet count. The model demonstrated robust discrimination (training set AUC = 0.733; testing set AUC = 0.758), excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow ",
