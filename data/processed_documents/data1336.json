    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Early treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to limit the clinical progression of COVID-19. However, limited therapeutic options are available for standard-risk patients, including those under age 50 who have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccination as well as a bivalent booster.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      Metformin is a widely used, inexpensive antihyperglycemic for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 as well as polycystic ovarian syndrome, with a well-described safety profile.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, metformin is known to alter glucose metabolism and is under investigation as an antiviral agent, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2. Recent work suggests metformin may also serve as a therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19 as well as those with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known more commonly as 'long COVID-19.' This manuscript examines what is known about metformin for the treatment of COVID-19 and explores how this drug may be used in the future to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
