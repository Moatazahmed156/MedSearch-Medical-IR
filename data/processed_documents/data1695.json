The reaction proceeds at room temperature with an O2 balloon as the oxidant using commercially available materials as the substrates and catalysts. The catalyst system is characterized by a broad range of substrates and a good tolerance to sensitive functional groups. The gram-scale experiment proves this system's practicability.",
