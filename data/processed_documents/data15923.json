    "abstract": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) poses an increasing threat to global public health. This study aimed to investigate pathogen characteristics of bacterial/fungal co-infections and determine prognostic factors for mortality in co-infected SFTS patients. Demographic and clinical data were collected for eligible SFTS patients admitted to a sentinel hospital. LASSO and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent predictors. A total of 629 SFTS patients were included, of whom 283 (45.0%) presented with co-infections. Most isolates (75.9%) obtained from respiratory specimens. Among 127 isolated fungi,  This study highlights that bacterial/fungal co-infections are highly prevalent and clinically impactful in SFTS patients, warranting enhanced microbial surveillance and targeted intervention.",
