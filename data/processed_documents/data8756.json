    "abstract": "Cancer gene therapy is the transfer of genetic material to the cells of an individual with the goal of eradicating cancer cells, both in the primary tumor and metastases. Cancer gene therapy strategies exploit our expanding knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer, thereby allowing rationally targeted interventions at the molecular level. The successful implementation of cancer gene therapy in the clinic awaits the development of vectors capable of specific and efficient gene delivery to cancer cells. The first clinical applications of cancer gene therapy are likely to be in combination with conventional therapies, such as radiotherapy and immunotherapy.",
