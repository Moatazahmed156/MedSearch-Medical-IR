    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, with inflammation playing a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. Chronic inflammation in the intestine significantly increases the risk of CRC development. Main compounds participating in the inflammatory process are prostaglandins; bioactive lipids derived from arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. While it is well known that prostaglandin E",
