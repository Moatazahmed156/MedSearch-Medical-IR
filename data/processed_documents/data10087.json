    "title": "A Particular Case of Myocardial Injury.",
    "abstract": "We report a case of a patient admitted to our coronary intensive care unit with chest pain and elevated cardiac troponin. Coronary angiography showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. The patient had a history of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, treated with dupilumab. Laboratory tests revealed marked hypereosinophilia, prompting a cardiac MRI, which showed findings consistent with eosinophilic myocarditis. This diagnosis was later confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. This case highlights the importance of differential diagnosis in cases of myocardial injury (characterized by increased cardiac troponin) and underscores the value of CMR as the most accurate non-invasive technique for detecting myocarditis.",
