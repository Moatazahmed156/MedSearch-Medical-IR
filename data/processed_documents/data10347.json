    "abstract": "Infective endocarditis (IE) can lead to infectious intracranial aneurysms (IIAs) in a small percentage of cases. These aneurysms may rupture, resulting in intracerebral bleeding that is typically evident on neuroimaging. However, diagnosis becomes challenging when blood cultures and echocardiography are unremarkable, and neuroimaging is misinterpreted as a neoplasm due to overlapping features. We report a rare case of a ruptured IIA initially misdiagnosed as a brain tumor. A 43-year-old man presented with seizures, right-sided hemiparesis, and a 3-month history of fever, malaise, and 15-kg weight loss. Head computed tomography (CT) revealed a left frontal lesion with solid and hemorrhagic components, vasogenic edema, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing mass-like lesion. Negative pan-cultures, normal echocardiography, and temporary improvement with oral prednisone led to a presumed diagnosis of brain tumor, and the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up. Three months later, he was readmitted with persistent fever. This time, ",
