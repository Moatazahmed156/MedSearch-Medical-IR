    "abstract": "The role of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) inflammation in coronary collateral circulation (CCC) development remains unclear. This study compared PCAT characteristics in chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients with good vs. poor collaterals. Twenty left anterior descending CTO patients were stratified into poor (P-CCC,  PCAT inflammation is associated with enhanced collateral vessel formation. These findings highlight PCAT's potential as a therapeutic target for collateral promotion, warranting further investigation into its molecular mechanisms.",
