    "abstract": "No report is available on the treatment of primary colorectal cancer (CRC) by transarterial chemotherapy combined with lipiodol chemoembolization in tumor-feeding arteries. To determine the safety and efficacy of transarterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) and lipiodol chemoembolization for the treatment of primary CRC. Thirty-seven patients with advanced CRC received TAI and lipiodol chemoembolization once a month, 1-3 times in all. Clinical efficacy, complications, and effectiveness were evaluated 1 month after each session. All 37 patients were successfully treated. The most common complications were abdominal discomfort, nausea, tenesmus, and myelosuppression. The overall disease control and objective response rates were 97.3% and 67.6%, respectively. Twenty-four patients survived and 13 died; the median survival duration was 21.1 months. Age was a significant influencing factor of overall survival. Transarterial chemotherapy combined with lipiodol chemoembolization appears to be safe and effective for treating advanced CRC.",
