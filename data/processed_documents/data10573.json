We assessed the independent effects of indoor home exposures and ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM We included 6,413 children born 1987-2016 from nine United States prospective birth cohorts from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes consortium, with complete covariate and outcome data. Exposures were (1) average ambient PM By age 5 years, 10.3%-50.3% of children had developed asthma across general-risk and high-risk cohorts. We found a significant detrimental association of PM Multiple early exposures, such as PM",
