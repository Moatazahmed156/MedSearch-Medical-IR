    "abstract": "Noninvasive cardiac imaging by transthoracic echocardiography is among the first-line assessments in evaluation of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although systolic function seems preserved by conventional measurers, important information is found through examination of the heart's hemodynamic profile through Doppler and novel echocardiographic measures. These measures aid in establishing the diagnosis of HFpEF and provide valuable prognostic information. Targets of interest include the left ventricle diastolic function, atrial structure and function, and right ventricular function including pulmonary pressures. Contemporary assessments of the hemodynamic profile attainable through echocardiography in HFpEF at rest are reviewed and future directions outlined.",
