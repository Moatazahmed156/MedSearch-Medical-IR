    "title": "Therapeutic effects of fluorescent gabapentin carbon quantum dots on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats.",
    "abstract": "We aimed to synthesize carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from the active molecule gabapentin (GBP) and to test their effects on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. Gabapentin CQDs (GBPCQDs) were successfully synthesized in a microwave reactor using a rapid, one-pot bottom-up method. Particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential measurements were conducted for characterization. Chemical degradation was also evaluated using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Adult male Wistar rats (250-320 g) were used as subjects. GBP and GBPCQDs (15, 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg), saline or vehicle, were administered intraperitoneally (ip) to rats 30 minutes before PTZ (50 mg/kg, ip) treatment. The onset time and severity of the seizures were evaluated. Locomotor activity was assessed for the effective doses of the treatments. Fluorescence was also assessed in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. While GBPCQDs (15 mg/kg) caused a significant prolongation in the onset time of seizures (p = 0.045), GBP did not produce any substantial change in this parameter. Both GBP and GBPCQDs, at all doses, significantly reduced the severity of the seizures (p",
