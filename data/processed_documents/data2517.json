    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a collective term for pediatric inflammatory arthritis of unknown etiology, which presents diverse clinical and imaging findings. The pathogenesis is complex; however, most cases stem from an autoimmune mechanism. Herein we provide a short review of imaging findings of JIA. Imaging assessment begins with plain radiography demonstrating joint swelling, periarticular osteopenia, and juxtaarticular bone erosion. Bone erosion occurs later in JIA. Instead, aberrant epimetaphyseal growth often gives the first clue to the diagnosis. US and MRI can demonstrate the details of the synovium, cartilage, and subchondral bone. JIA is subdivided into oligoarthritis, polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor-negative and positive), psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and systemic JIA. Awareness of the different clinical characteristics, pathogenic background, and prognosis of each subtype facilitates a more advanced, imaging-based diagnosis. Unlike the other types, systemic JIA is an autoinflammatory disease accompanied by inflammatory cytokinemia and systemic symptoms stemming from aberrant activation of the innate immunity. Other autoinflammatory diseases, both monogenic (e.g., NOMID/CINCA) and multifactorial (e.g., CRMO), are also discussed.",
