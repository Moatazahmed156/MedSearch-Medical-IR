    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unusually associated with diabetes insipidus (DI) in patients bearing monosomy 7 or chromosome 3 aberrations. To date, 84 cases have been reported worldwide. Physiopathological mechanisms linking these chromosomal abnormalities to DI are not yet understood. We report two patients with AML/DI and review the medical literature on those conditions.",
