    "abstract": "Achieving multiplexed, equipment-free, and sensitivity-enhanced antigen detection within a true one-step lateral flow format remains a technical challenge. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are widely used for point-of-care diagnostics, yet their sensitivity-particularly in weak-positive specimens-often limits reliable pathogen identification. Herein, we enhance the analytical performance of LFIA by introducing a structurally integrated self-enhancement strategy that maintains the simplicity of one-step operation without requiring additional user steps. In the proposed SET-LFIA, two enhancement pads loaded with Au",
