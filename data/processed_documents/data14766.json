    "title": "Gut microbiota modulation in GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i therapy: clinical implications and mechanistic insights in type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) have been shown to provide extra-glycemic advantages, such as cardiovascular and renal protection, in the treatment of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM). Recent data points to the possibility that gut microbiota modification may contribute to their beneficial impact. This review examines changes in microbial composition, metabolite synthesis (such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, and endotoxins), and their systemic implications by integrating clinical and preclinical data on the interactions between various drug types and the gut microbiota. GLP-1RAs may favor certain taxa that synthesize SCFA and ",
