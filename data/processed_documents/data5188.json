    "abstract": "The role of genetics in heart disease diagnosis and management is expanding daily. Clear genetic components have been found for diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Rhythm disturbances with genetic components are atrial fibrillation and long QT syndrome. Gene therapies to treat cardiac diseases include those designed to prevent vein graft stenosis and those that promote coronary angiogenesis.",
