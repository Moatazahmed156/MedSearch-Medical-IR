    "abstract": "Lymph nodes at different anatomical locations share similar architecture and operate on the basis of identical principles. Still, the quality of immune responses is modified substantially by the local peculiarities at the site of its induction. Here, we discuss how lymph node stroma cells contribute to functional differences between various lymph nodes, thus helping to explain why and how an immune response induced in skin draining peripheral lymph nodes differs from that elicited in the gut draining mesenteric lymph nodes. Stroma cells constitute a major part of the lymph node scaffold and control the flow of immune cells as well as soluble substances within the organ. Moreover, stroma cells express cytokines, chemokines as well as adhesion factors and thereby actively influence immune status. Lymph node transplantations and adoptive transfers of dendritic cells demonstrated that regional lymph node stroma cells differ in their ability to support mucosal tolerance, the induction of tissue tropism, and humoral immunity. This suggests that stroma cells shape tissue-specific immune responses and equip lymph nodes with unique functional properties that might originate during lymph node organogenesis.",
