    "abstract": "The development of more specific biomarkers for prostate cancer and/or high-risk prostate cancer is necessary, because the prostate-specific antigen test lacks specificity for the detection of prostate cancer and can lead to unnecessary prostate biopsies. Urine is a promising source for the development of new biomarkers of prostate cancer. Biomarkers derived from prostate cancer cells are released into prostatic fluids and then into urine. Urine after manipulation of the prostate is enriched with prostate cancer biomarkers, which include prostate cancer cells, DNAs, RNAs, proteins and other small molecules. The urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved RNA-based urinary marker, and it helps in the detection of prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. The SelectMDx test is based on messenger RNA detection of DLX1 and HOXC6 in urine after prostate massage, and helps in the detection of high-risk prostate cancer on prostate biopsy. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 30-200 nm that are secreted from various types of cells. Urinary prostate cancer-derived exosomes also contain RNAs and proteins specific for prostate cancer (e.g. PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG), and could be promising sources of novel biomarker discovery. The ExoDx Prostate test is a commercially available test based on the detection of three genes (PCA3, ERG and SPDEF) in urinary exosomes. Advancement of comprehensive analysis (microarray, mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing) has resulted in the discovery of several urinary biomarkers. Non-invasive urinary markers can help in the decision to carry out prostate biopsy or in the design of a therapeutic strategy.",
