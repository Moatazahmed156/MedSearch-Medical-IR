Endometrial polyps are benign in nature and affect both reproductive age and postmenopausal women. Although endometrial polyps are relatively common and may be accompanied by abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation. In asymptomatic women, endometrial polyps may regress spontaneously, in symptomatic women endometrial polyps can be treated safely and efficiently with hysteroscopic excision.",
