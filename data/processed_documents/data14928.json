    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the role and possible mechanism of action of hexokinase domain containing 1 (HKDC1) in liver cirrhosis. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation model was established in LX-2 cells by transforming growth factor (TGF)-βl stimulation. A mouse model of hepatic fibrosis was established using carbon tetrachloride (CCl In liver cirrhosis tissues and activated HSCs, HKDC1 expression was upregulated. CCl HKDC1 silencing alleviates liver fibrosis and HSC activation by regulating glycolysis and decreasing histone lactylation of the promoter of ORMDL3.",
