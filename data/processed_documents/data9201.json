    "abstract": "One of the most significant treatment approaches now accessible is stem cell therapy. Over the last few decades, a lot of study has been done in this field, and this fascinating feature of plasticity could have therapeutic uses. The potential of stem cells to restore function lost as a result of disease, trauma, congenital defects, and age has made stem cell research a key priority for scientific and medical organizations across the world. Stem cells are a crucial topic of study in regenerative medicine because of their capacity to replace, repair, or regenerate damaged cells, tissues, or organs. As a result, stem cell therapy is being used as a treatment strategy for a number of illnesses. Because stem cells may proliferate indefinitely and generate vast quantities of differentiated cells needed for transplantation, they hold enormous promise for regenerative medicine. Stem cells can be reprogrammed from adult cell types or originate from embryonic or fetal origins. Depending on their availability and place of origin, stem cells can be totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, or unipotent. With stem cell treatment, many ailments, including diabetes, liver disease, infertility, wounds and traumas, neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, might be cured. Various types of stem cell treatment are described in this review along with their applications in different therapeutic fields, ethical considerations, and advantages and disadvantages.",
