    "abstract": "The incidence of pediatric-onset ulcerative colitis (UC) is rising. Children often present with a more severe disease phenotype as compared to adults with over a third requiring hospitalization for the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). Further, in pediatric patients presenting with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) limited to the colon, a definitive diagnosis of UC vs. Crohn's disease is often unclear. Here, we review the unique aspects of pediatric ASUC including the epidemiology, diagnosis, medical, and surgical management of this disease.",
