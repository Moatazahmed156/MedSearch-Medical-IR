    "abstract": "This review synthesizes interdisciplinary evidence on how environmental stressors-including climate change, urbanization, and air pollution-impact pollen dynamics and human health. We assess conventional and innovative monitoring methods to identify critical gaps in exposure evaluation and public health response. Recent research confirms that climate change and urbanization are prolonging pollen seasons and increasing pollen potency. Pollutants such as O",
