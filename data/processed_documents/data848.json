    "abstract": "Bioactive oligopeptides have gained increasing attention due to their diverse physiological functions, and these can be transported into the vasculature via transcellular and paracellular pathways. Among these, paracellular transport through the intercellular space is a passive diffusion process without energy consumption. It is currently the most frequently reported absorption route for food-derived bioactive oligopeptides. Previous work has demonstrated that paracellular pathways are mainly controlled by tight junctions, but the mechanism by which they regulate paracellular absorption of bioactive oligopeptides remains unclear. In this review, we summarized the composition of paracellular pathways across the intercellular space and elaborated on the paracellular transport mechanism of bioactive oligopeptides in terms of the interaction between oligopeptides and tight junction proteins, the protein expression level of tight junctions, the signaling pathways regulating intestinal permeability, and the properties of oligopeptides themselves. These findings contribute to a more profound understanding of the paracellular absorption of bioactive oligopeptides.",
