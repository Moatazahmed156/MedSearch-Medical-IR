    "abstract": "The high comorbidity rates of depression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have garnered widespread attention. As a refractory disease, its long-term stress effects exacerbate the coexistence of depression. Depression is linked to a decline in lung function in patients with COPD through reduced heart rate variability, increased inflammatory cytokines, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the interplay of various biological and psychological factors. Sole reliance on biomedical treatment cannot fully counteract these negative effects, which are detrimental to improving patients' quality of life and long-term prognosis.
