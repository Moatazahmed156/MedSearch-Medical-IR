    "abstract": "The present study retrospectively assessed clinical outcomes of proximal optimization technique (POT)-kissing-POT (PKP) and POT-side-POT (PSP) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with culprit coronary bifurcation lesion (CBL) following a provisional stenting (PS). This large-scale multicenter (n = 10) study included STEMI patients with culprit CBLs who underwent PKP or PSP following PS. The primary endpoint was defined as the major adverse cardiac events (MACE; cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [TVMI], or clinically driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Consecutive patients (n = 596; male: 491 [82.3%], mean age: 58.1 ± 11.7 years) were included. The study cohort was divided into 2 groups: PKP (n = 386) and PSP (n = 210). In the overall population, mid-term MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.921, ",
