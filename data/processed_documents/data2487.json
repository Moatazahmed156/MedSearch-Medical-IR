    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis includes conditions characterized by joint inflammation of unknown etiology lasting longer than 6 weeks in patients younger than 16 years. Diagnosis and medical management are complex and best coordinated by a pediatric rheumatologist. The mainstay of therapy is anti-inflammatory and biologic medications to control pain and joint inflammation. Orthopedic surgical treatment may be indicated for deformity, limb length inequality, or end-stage arthritis. Evaluation of the cervical spine and appropriate medication management in consultation with a patient's rheumatologist are essential in perioperative care. Preoperative planning should take into account patient deformity, contracture, small size, osteopenia, and medical comorbidities.",
