    "title": "Is there any role for HBV pgRNA in fibrosis and HCC predisposition?",
    "abstract": "In this cohort, we aimed to study the evolution of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) during treatment and compare it with other disease scores such as FIB-4 and PAGE-B. Eighty-eight HBeAg negative CHB who received long-term treatment with NAs were included. A quantitative HBV S antigen (HBsAg) assay was performed, and viral HBV DNA was quantified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Finally, viral RNA levels (pre-core RNA (preC RNA) and pgRNA) were analyzed using the RTPCR protocol. The FIB-4 score was calculated for all patients, depicting the cirrhosis course, while the platelet-related PAGE-B score contributed to the 5-year cumulative prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Statistical multivariate analysis was performed using the R studio and CATREG SPSS optimal scaling algorithm of SPSS 26.0.0.0. A total of 18.1% of our sample was positive for HBV pgRNA, delineating a positive correlation with cirrhosis and an apparently negative correlation with therapy duration. HBV pgRNA was not independently correlated with FIB-4 ( Based on our results, further longitudinal studies are needed to assess the potential usefulness of HBV pgRNA as prognosticator of liver fibrosis and susceptibility to HCC.",
