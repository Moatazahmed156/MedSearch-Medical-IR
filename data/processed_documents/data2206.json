A primary intramedullary spinal cord germinoma is very rare, and only four other cases have been reported in the literature. All five cases are reviewed regarding the appearance of the germinomas, their neuroradiological features, and their histopathological findings. We also discuss treatment choices for germinomas of the spinal cord.",
