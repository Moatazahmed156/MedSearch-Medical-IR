    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a growing condition among adolescent and adult populations, present in around 20%-30% of people in the United Kingdom. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is known as a silent disease and over many years may go on to cause nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In the future it may become a leading contributor to cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and mortality. In recent years, programs have been set up to raise awareness of this condition with the first International NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) Day taking place in 2018; nevertheless, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is still not clearly understood by many. An extensive review has shown a lack of nursing literature on this topic, and effective specialist nurse input for this patient group should be a key component in tackling this growing epidemic in the years to come.",
