    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecologic malignancy, with more than 15,000 deaths anticipated in 2012. While approximately 80% of patients will respond to frontline chemotherapy, more than 60% of patients will experience disease recurrence and only 44% will be alive at 5 y. Host anti-tumor immune responses are associated with a significant improvement in overall survival for women with ovarian cancer. By bolstering these responses, it may therefore be possible to significantly influence the prognosis of women with this lethal disease. In this review, we will focus on innovative immune-based strategies which are currently being investigated in the treatment of ovarian cancer.",
