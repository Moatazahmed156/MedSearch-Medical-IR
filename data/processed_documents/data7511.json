Despite its low incidence, IBC contributes to 7% to 10% of breast cancer caused mortality. Despite ongoing international efforts to formulate better diagnosis, treatment, and research, the survival of patients with IBC has not been significantly improved, and there are no therapeutic agents that specifically target IBC to date. The authors present a comprehensive overview that aims to assess the present and new management strategies of IBC.",
