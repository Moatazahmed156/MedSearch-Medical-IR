    "abstract": "Background Invasive pneumococcal infections, such as bacteremia, remain associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly among individuals with underlying health conditions. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association between patient comorbidities, particularly chronic cardiac disease, and the development of complicated pneumococcal bacteremia. Secondary objectives included assessing vaccine coverage and clinical outcomes among high-risk patients.
