    "abstract": "Patients undergoing treatment of head and neck cancer risk developing significant acute and chronic changes that affect the hard and soft tissue of the oral cavity and the head and neck region. This article discusses considerations and recommendations for patients before, during, and after treatment of head and neck cancer. The objective of these recommendations is to maintain oral health, compensate for treatment- and disease-associated morbidities, and improve quality of life. To achieve this objective, treatment of head and neck cancer must include an oral evaluation and management plan well-integrated within the overall oncologic treatment plan from the initiation of therapy.",
