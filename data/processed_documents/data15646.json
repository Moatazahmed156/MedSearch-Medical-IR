    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on various aspects of the personal lives of students of Mymensingh Medical College. This study is descriptive cross-sectional observational study that has been carried out concentrating on the undergraduate and postgraduate students of Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh. The location was selected purposively and the \"Raosoft sample size calculator\" was used in order to determine the size of the sample. The acceptable margin of error for this study is 5.0% at a 95.0% confidence interval, 50.0% response distribution from the total number of 1655 medical students; the calculated minimum total sample size was 312- undergraduate students 218 and postgraduate students 94. Medical students were selected purposively based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reliability of the questionnaire has been ensured by measuring Cronbach's α coefficient (0.635) and validity has been established by KMO and Bartlett test. The data collection process started in January 2021 and concluded in December 2021. Correlation analysis indicates a statistically significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the personal lives of the respondents by producing a p-value less than 0.05. The study suggests that most medical students have experienced an increased sense of loneliness and depression regardless of their demographic attributes. Physical health did not improve, although consumption of junk food decreased. On the other hand, students became more religious however, their sense of empathy did not change much and they were currently seized by session jam. The experience of online classes has not been perceived positively by the students.",
