    "abstract": "Morbid obesity (MO) is a national health problem. We sought to study the prevalence and contemporary trends of MO in hospitalized young adults. Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) for the years 2016-2019 was queried for young adult MO admissions (aged 18-35 years). A total of 750,972 (7.1%) MO admissions were analyzed. There was a trend of increasing MO admissions from 6.5% in 2016 to 7.7% in 2019 (Ptrend <0.001). MO was independently associated with an increase in mean costs by 270 million dollars per year of analysis. Authors suggest developing national programs targeting MO in young adults.",
