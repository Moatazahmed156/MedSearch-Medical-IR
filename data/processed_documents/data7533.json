    "abstract": "Two to 11% of women diagnosed with breast cancer will develop contralateral breast cancer in their lifetime. Women with a first primary are at a 2-6-fold increased risk of developing contralateral breast cancer compared with the risk in the general population of women developing a first primary cancer. The incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer varies from four to eight per 1000 person-years. To assess the risk factors associated with the development of contralateral breast cancer among women with a first primary breast cancer, the epidemiological literature concerning these factors was reviewed and summarized. Studies have shown that a family history of breast cancer, an early age at initial diagnosis, and a lobular histology of the first primary breast cancer increase the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. Although chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy may reduce this risk, there are inconsistent results regarding the effects of radiotherapy and the effects of reproductive, environmental and other factors. Additional analytical studies addressing all potential risk factors associated with the development of contralateral breast cancer are necessary in view of the increasing incidence and survival of women with a first primary.",
