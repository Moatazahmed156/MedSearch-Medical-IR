    "abstract": "During the 20th century, a dramatic epidemic of lung cancer deaths has occurred in many countries. The time trends of lung cancer incidence and mortality primarily reflect patterns of cigarette smoking, the predominant risk factor, but inconsistencies are evident in international comparisons. Although the predominant role of tobacco smoking as a cause of lung cancer throughout the world is amply documented, the persistence of tobacco smoking and the continued penetration of manufactured cigarettes into new markets provide a strong reason for continuing to monitor lung cancer trends. Changes in other risk factors for lung cancer and changes in diagnostic and death certificate reporting practices may also affect trends in rates. However, our understanding of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer allows forecasting of lung cancer rates for public health planning.",
