    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses enter cells by membrane fusion. The viral membrane fuses with a host membrane, either at the cell surface or within endocytic compartments. For endocytic entry, fusion is typically triggered by low pH and often requires proteolytic priming by compartment-specific host proteases, which together define the site and mechanism of fusion and shape viral tropism. Inhibition of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, which generates PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P",
