    "title": "Precision Medicine in Diabetic Retinopathy: The Role of Genetic and Epigenetic Biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus and its microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), present significant health challenges. DR is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age individuals in developed countries. The prevalence of DR continues to rise, underscoring the need for more precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Due to its multifactorial nature and despite advancements in understanding DR pathophysiology, predicting its onset and progression remains challenging. Traditional screening and treatment methods often fall short of addressing the heterogeneous nature of the disease, underscoring the need for personalised therapeutic strategies. Recent research has highlighted the vital role of genetic biomarkers in the development and progression of DR, paving the way for a precision medicine approach. Personalised eye care in patients with diabetes aims to accurately predict the risk of DR progression and visual loss in real time. A precision medicine approach that utilises genetic biomarkers offers a promising pathway for personalised diagnosis and treatment strategies. Each DR case is distinct in phenotype, genotype, and therapeutic response, making personalised therapy crucial for optimising outcomes. Advancements in genomics, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have identified numerous genetic markers associated with DR susceptibility and severity. Emerging evidence underscores the critical role of genetic factors, which account for 25-50% of the risk of developing DR. Advances in identifying genetic markers, such as gene polymorphisms and human leukocyte antigen associations, along with the development of targeted drugs, highlight a promising future for personalised medicine in DR. By identifying specific genetic variants associated with DR, we can enhance prevention and early diagnosis, tailor personalised treatment plans, and more accurately predict disease progression. This represents a critical step toward personalised medicine in DR management. Integrating genetic and epigenetic biomarkers into clinical models may transform DR care through earlier diagnosis and precision-guided interventions, gearing it toward precision ophthalmology.",
