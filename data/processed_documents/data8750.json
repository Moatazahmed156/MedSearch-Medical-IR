    "abstract": "Possibilities of using the skin for somatic gene therapy have been investigated for more than 20 years. Strategies have included both direct gene transfer into the skin and indirect gene transfer utilizing cultured cells as an intermediate step for gene manipulation. Viral as well as nonviral vectors have been used, and both gene addition and gene editing have been performed. Although cutaneous gene therapy has now begun translating into clinical medicine (as seen by the first clinical gene therapy project of an inherited skin disorder) further developments are still required.",
