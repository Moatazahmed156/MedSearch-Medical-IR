    "abstract": "Achieving effective community reintegration is important to maximize recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury, simultaneously limiting caregiver burden and improving satisfaction with quality of life. Certain medical complications that are common after brain injury may impact community reintegration, and should be addressed by the physician in a systematic approach. Additionally certain social and environmental factors such as mobility or return to work or school may arise, and should be addressed proactively by the physician. Inpatient/residential or outpatient programs with case management and a multi-disciplinary team can facilitate community reentry for patients, and should be considered when available.",
