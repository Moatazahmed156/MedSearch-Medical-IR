    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death. Screening for lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography improves mortality. Various modalities exist for diagnosis and staging. Treatment is determined by subtype and stage of cancer; there are several personalized therapies that did not exist just a few years ago. Caring for the patient with lung cancer is a complex task. This review provides a broad outline of this disease, helping clinicians identify such patients and familiarizing them with lung cancer care options, so they are better equipped to guide their patients along this challenging journey.",
