    "abstract": "The independent and combined effects of osteoporosis and diabetes on mandibular and tibial fracture healing under varied mechanical loading in a rat model (n=120) is of interest. Osteoporosis and diabetes each impaired healing, with comorbid rats showing the most severe reductions in BMD (Bone Mineral Density) and biomechanical strength. Cyclic loading worsened outcomes in diabetic rats, while reduced loading benefited osteoporotic fractures. Disarranged angiogenesis and collagen organization in comorbid groups is confirmed histologically. Thus, we show the need to customize various procedures in patients with systemic comorbidities.",
