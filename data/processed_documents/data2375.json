    "abstract": "The human endometrium is a unique, highly dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclic changes of cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy among women in developed countries. Importantly, the incidence of endometrial cancer is rising in high-income countries. Currently histological classification is used for subtyping of endometrial cancer, while ongoing research is evaluating markers for more accurate molecular classification. Evolutionary conserved Notch signaling pathway regulates diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell invasion. Accumulating evidence links aberrant Notch signaling with diseases such as hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. This chapter summarizes the current state of Notch signaling investigations in the endometrium, endometriosis, and endometrial cancer.",
