    "abstract": "Despite the widespread integration of quality improvement principles into pediatric surgical practice, the actual adoption of evidence-based practices continues to be a challenge. The field of pediatric surgery, in particular, has been slow to adopt clinical pathways and protocols that lead to decreased practice variation and improved clinical outcomes. This manuscript provides an introduction to how implementation science principles into quality improvement efforts may optimize uptake of evidence-based practices, ensure success of these endeavors, and help assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Examples of implementation science application to pediatric surgical quality improvement endeavors are explored.",
