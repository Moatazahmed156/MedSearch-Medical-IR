    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Autochthonous transmission of the dengue virus (DENV) occurred each year from 2014 to 2018 in Zhejiang province, and became an emerging public health problem. We characterized the autochthonous transmission of the DENV and traced the source of infection for further control and prevention of dengue.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Descriptive and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were conducted to characterize the epidemiology of autochthonous transmission of the DENV. Molecular epidemiology was used to identify the infection source.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 1,654 indigenous cases and 12 outbreaks, with no deaths, were reported during 2004-2018. Before 2017, all outbreaks occurred in suburban areas. During 2017-2018, five out of eight outbreaks occurred in urban areas. The median duration of outbreaks (28 days) in 2017-2018 was shortened significantly (P = 0.028) in comparison with that in 2004-2016 (71 days). The median onset-visiting time, visiting-confirmation time, and onset-confirmation time was 1, 3, and 4 days, respectively. The DENV serotypes responsible for autochthonous transmission in Zhejiang Province were DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 3, with DENV 1 being the most frequently reported. Southeast Asia was the predominant source of indigenous infection.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Zhejiang Province witnessed an increase in the frequency, incidence, and geographic expansion of indigenous Dengue cases in recent years. The more developed coastal and central region of Zhejiang Province was impacted the most.",
