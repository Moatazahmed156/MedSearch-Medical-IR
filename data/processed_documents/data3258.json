We report a case of a vulvar ulcer caused by botryomycosis.\n    \n\n\n          Case:\n        \n      \n      An 85-year-old woman presented with vulvar itching, pain, bleeding, and ulcerations suspicious for cancer. Biopsies of the ulcers returned without dysplasia or malignancy. She was referred to the tertiary care vulvar vaginal disease clinic.
