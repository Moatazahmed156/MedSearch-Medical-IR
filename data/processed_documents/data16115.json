    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented strains on healthcare. With resources appropriately diverted toward managing the pandemic, less prevalent pathology was uniquely susceptible to the negative impacts of resource constraints. IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (WT-GBM) is one such example, as it yields a poor prognosis even in the most optimal resource setting. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was employed to isolate cases of WT-GBM with a minimum 24-month follow-up. Cases were grouped into pre-pandemic (2019) and pandemic-era (2020) cohorts. Kaplan-Meier log rank and multivariate cox regression survival analyses as well as univariate comparison analyses were performed. Pre-pandemic ( These real-world data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect WT-GBM all-cause survival nor did it significantly impact the care of these patients. Further study with long-term follow-up is necessary to better understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on rare pathologies, such as neuro-oncological diseases.",
