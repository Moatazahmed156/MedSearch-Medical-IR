    "title": "Plasma Fibulin-5 as a Novel Marker for Advanced Fibrosis in Chronic Hepatitis C.",
    "abstract": "Despite remarkable advances in the treatment of viral hepatitis, liver fibrosis sometimes persists after viral eradication. The accumulation of elastic fiber is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. We aimed to clarify the utility of plasma fibulin-5 (FBLN5), a component of elastic fibers, in assessing liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis. We reviewed 90 patients with chronic hepatitis C who underwent liver biopsy. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we investigated the localization of FBLN5 and its correlation with α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). We then analyzed mRNA and protein expression in human hepatic stellate cells (HHSteCs) and primary mouse stellate cells. Lastly, we evaluated the utility of plasma FBLN5 for predicting liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a correlation between the quantity of FBLN5 and αSMA ( FBLN5 may represent the activation of hepatic stellate cells, and plasma FBLN5 levels have the potential to predict advanced fibrosis, especially in fibrosis related to elastic fibers.",
