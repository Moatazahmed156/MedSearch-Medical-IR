    "abstract": "The plant sample was collected, dried, and grinded into coarse powder which was then soaked in methanol for 2 weeks. After the maceration process, the crude methanolic extract was subjected to solvent-solvent partitioning into four different fractions: n-hexane soluble fraction (HSF), dichloromethane soluble fraction (DMSF), ethyl acetate soluble fraction (EASF), and aqueous fraction (AQF). DMSF was chemically evaluated through chromatographic separation, and all the fractions including the crude methanolic extracts were assessed for their potential pharmacological activities against pain, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, and microbes following standard protocols. Chemical investigation results in the isolation of lupeol,  Three isolated phytochemicals demonstrate promising binding affinities with the receptor molecules that support the pharmacological findings of this study. However, additional research needs to be conducted to isolate more phytoconstituents and affirm the pharmacological potential of ",
