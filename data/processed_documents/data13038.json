    "abstract": "Free radicals are key contributors to several diseases, including cancer, inflammation, pain, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Due to the limitations and adverse effects of synthetic antioxidants, naturally occurring phytochemicals offer safer, more sustainable alternatives. This study investigates the antioxidant potential of twigs of  Compounds were isolated using chromatographic methods, and their structures established by 1D- and 2D-NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and comparison with reported data. Antioxidant activity was assessed through DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP assays, while molecular docking against xanthine oxidase (PDB: 1FIQ) explored possible mechanisms beyond direct radical scavenging. A new macrocyclic bisbibenzyl derivative, combrebisbibenzyl A ( These findings support the traditional use of ",
