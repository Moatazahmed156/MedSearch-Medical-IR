    "abstract": "The escalating global crisis of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacterial infections, along with the continuous threat of viral outbreaks, poses a serious risk to public health worldwide and underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were successfully synthesized and subsequently functionalized with copper to impart broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The oxidation state of copper on the MSN surface was modulated through thermal treatments, allowing the evaluation of its influence on antimicrobial efficacy. The modified MSNs were tested against key bacterial pathogens, including ",
