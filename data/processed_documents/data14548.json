    "abstract": "Inflammation triggered by injury, infection, or exposure to chemicals results in chronic diseases, and constitutes the leading cause of death worldwide. Anti-inflammatory drugs available for the treatment of inflammation mainly leads to side effects like ulcers or kidney damage which necessitate the need for safer alternatives of these drugs. Probiotics, live beneficial microorganisms, have garnered significant attention for their role in modulating immune responses and reducing the inflammation, and are generally considered as safe. Probiotics aid in reducing inflammation by improving gut health and immune balance. The anti-inflammatory potential of probiotics aids in preventing and managing chronic inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), arthritis, autoimmune diseases and metabolic disorders. Mechanistically, probiotics modulate immune responses by increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), while down regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Some strains, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, have demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory potential. Probiotic bacteria also exhibit antioxidant potential thereby, reducing the oxidative stress which is a key driver of chronic inflammation. This review explores the anti-inflammatory properties of probiotics, highlighting their mechanisms of action, including modulation of gut microbiota, enhancement of intestinal barrier integrity, regulation of immune responses, and production of bioactive metabolites. Furthermore, the current review discusses the therapeutic applications of probiotics in managing inflammatory diseases and the challenges associated with their usage. Therefore, understanding anti-inflammatory potential of probiotics could open new avenues for non-pharmacological interventions in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.",
