    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a pivotal role in driving colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and therapeutic resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating CRC-CSC properties are not fully understood. Proline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) is involved in various tumorigenic processes, yet little is known about its contribution to cancer stemness. In this study, we demonstrated that PRAS40 was overexpressed in CRC tissues and its elevated expression positively correlated with poor patient survival. Genetic ablation of PRAS40 suppressed tumorigenesis in CRC mouse models. Notably, PRAS40 enhanced the stemness of CRC cells, as evidenced by increased sphere formation, upregulation of stem cell markers, enrichment of the CD133",
