    "abstract": "The oral cavity acts as the anatomical gateway to the respiratory tract, sharing both microbiological and pathophysiological links with the lower airways. Although radiotherapy is a cornerstone treatment for lung cancer, reliable oral microbiome biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes remain lacking. We analyzed the oral microbiome of 136 lung cancer patients and 199 healthy controls across discovery and two validation cohorts via 16S rRNA sequencing. Healthy controls exhibited a significantly higher abundance of ",
