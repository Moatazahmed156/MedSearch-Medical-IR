    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus, is one of the most serious re-emerging pathogens. Growing outbreaks in the Americas have linked ZIKV to significant clinical symptoms including Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and congenital anomalies in newborns. ZIKV affects brain cells in a variety of ways, mostly apoptosis and cell cycle delays. Modulation of the host's immune reaction and the inflammatory process has also been shown to be involved in ZIKV-induced neurological disorders. This review summarized and discussed the latest advances in ZIKV research to shed fresh light on the multiple mechanisms incolved in ZIKV-induced neuropathogenesis.",
