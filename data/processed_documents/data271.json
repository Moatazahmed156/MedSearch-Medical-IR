    "abstract": "This article explores the implications of epistemic trust within the mentalizing model of psychopathology and psychotherapy, emphasizing the role of the restoration of epistemic trust in therapeutic settings. At the core of this exploration is the developmental theory of mentalizing, which posits that an individual's ability to understand mental states-both their own and others'-is cultivated through early caregiver interactions. The article expands on this concept by reviewing and integrating evolutionary theories suggesting that humans have evolved a unique sensitivity to teaching and learning through ostensive cues, enhancing our capacity for cultural transmission and cooperation. However, adversities such as trauma or neglect can disrupt this developmental trajectory, leading to epistemic disruption, where individuals struggle to engage with or learn from social experiences effectively. This disruption can manifest in psychological disorders, where mentalizing failures are associated with difficulties in social functioning and in maintaining relationships. The article proposes that psychotherapeutic approaches can effectively address these disruptions, and it outlines three key aspects of communication that unfold in psychotherapeutic interventions. It discusses how the effectiveness of these interventions may hinge on the reestablishment of epistemic trust, enabling patients to reengage with their social environments constructively and adaptively.",
