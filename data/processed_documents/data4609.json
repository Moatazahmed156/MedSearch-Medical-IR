    "abstract": "Nomenclature guidelines are proposed for non-specific and for syndromal forms of X-linked mental retardation. Non-specific mental retardations (MRX) are given unique symbols for each family (MRX1, MRX2, MRX3 ...). Syndromal mental retardations (MRXS) which do not as yet have specific symbols are given unique interim symbols for each syndrome (MRXS1, MRXS2, MRXS3 ...). The prerequisite for assignment of serial MRX and MRXS gene symbols is a minimum lod score (or multipoint lod score) of +2 between the MR locus and one or more X chromosome markers. Prior approval of availability for proposed gene symbols must be obtained from the Nomenclature Committee of the Human Gene Mapping Workshops.",
