    "title": "Staphylococci: What Has Changed in the Antibiotic Resistance Profile in the Last Decade-Analysis of Strains Isolated from Hospitalised Patients.",
    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance can be considered one of the major bacterial pathogenesis factors, and its increase is an important public health concern. Among resistant bacteria, staphylococci can express high levels of resistance, representing some of the most common human pathogens that are important causes of infection at any level. This paper aims to assess the burden of staphylococcal infections, in light of the growing phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, in a high-risk hospital setting. We carried out a cross-sectional study on data obtained from clinical specimens from an Italian healthcare facility particularly specialised in orthopaedics and traumatology. Specifically, we evaluated the trends in the ",
