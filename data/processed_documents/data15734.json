    "title": "Post-Vaccination Syndromes: The Evidence and a Roadmap for Rigorous Research.",
    "abstract": "The recent review by Yong et al. (Rev Med Virol. 2025; 35:e70070) proposes the entity of \"Long Vax Syndrome\" or Post-COVID-19 Vaccination Syndrome (PCVS). While this synthesis of anecdotal and early observational reports is a timely contribution, it necessitates a critical evaluation of the underlying evidence. This letter highlights substantial methodological limitations, including a reliance on data susceptible to significant ascertainment bias and the conflation of correlation with causation, given the non-negligible background prevalence of conditions like POTS and chronic fatigue. We argue that the pathophysiological narrative, while plausible, remains highly speculative due to a lack of direct mechanistic validation in human subjects. Furthermore, the proposed therapeutic strategies, borrowed from analogous disorders, are empiric and untested in this specific context, posing potential risks if adopted without evidence. The review by Yong et al. should thus serve not as a definitive guide, but as a critical catalyst for a disciplined research agenda. We outline essential next steps, including the urgent need for large, prospective controlled cohort studies to establish true incidence, deep phenotyping to identify distinct endotypes, and the development of standardised diagnostic criteria before randomised controlled trials can ethically evaluate interventions. Only through such rigorous inquiry can we ensure both compassionate care for affected individuals and the preservation of public confidence in vaccines.",
