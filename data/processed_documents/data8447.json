    "abstract": "The overall effectiveness of traditional antipsychotics has been hindered by their extrapyramidal side effects, which contribute to noncompliance and relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The side effects associated with traditional antipsychotic treatment are generally minimal in patients who take risperidone, a combined 5-HT2/D2 antagonist, but the literature is sparse on adverse events among the newer atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone is associated with relatively few motor side effects compared with the traditional antipsychotics, and weight gain is less likely with risperidone than with either clozapine or olanzapine. While increased prolactin levels have been reported in patients taking risperidone, little correlation has been found between prolactin levels and adverse events. As antipsychotic treatment options expand to include the new agents, it is important for clinicians to anticipate side effects and to query patients about specific adverse events.",
