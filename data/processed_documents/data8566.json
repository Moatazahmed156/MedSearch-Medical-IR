    "abstract": "Skin wound healing is a complex and dynamic biological process that involves many different cell types, the extracellular matrix, and mediators, such as neuropeptides, growth factors, and cytokines. Similar to diseases of the central nervous system, neurovascular interactions have been shown to play a pivotal role in skin wound healing, for example, as seen in the delayed healing of denervated skin. In aspects involving neurovascular interactions, while angiogenesis is considered important, physiological and pathological roles of these interactions in skin wound healing remain unclear. In this review, we discuss recent findings on neurovascular interactions in skin wound healing, with a particular focus on angiogenesis.",
