    "abstract": "Targeting cancer metabolism has become a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme that replenishes tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. PC is overexpressed in several types of human cancers, especially in aggressive cancers, including breast and colon cancer, where it promotes growth, survival, and metastasis. Recently, N",
