    "abstract": "Kidney function influences the concentration of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI). We investigate how this impacts their prognostic ability. This Danish nationwide study included patients from 2013 to 2023 with at least two measurements of Roche hs-cTnT, Abbott hs-cTnI, or Siemens hs-cTnI Vista or Atellica during the index admission. Patients were stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We assessed prognostic ability by Cox models and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. We included 277,723 patients (median age 69 years, 38.4 % female) of whom 19,565 (7.0 %) died within 30 days. Almost all patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m Kidney function affects cTn prognostic performance, with reduced predictive ability and higher optimal cutoff concentrations for lower eGFR.",
