    "abstract": "Various studies have demonstrated the tremendous tropism of stem cells for malignant gliomas, making these cells a potential vehicle for delivery of therapeutic genes to disseminated glioma cells. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the glioma-induced tropism of stem cells. Soluble factors including chemokines or growth factors released and expressed by glioma cells at least mediate the tropism of stem cells for gliomas. Here we review the possible mechanisms of stem cells tropism for malignant gliomas.",
