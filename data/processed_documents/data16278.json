    "abstract": "To investigate the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and potential micropeptides encoded by these lncRNAs in influenza A virus (IAV) replication, we analyzed the data obtained from RNA-seq and Ribo-seq. We found that the lncRNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) was significantly up-regulated by IAV infection. This finding was confirmed by ",
