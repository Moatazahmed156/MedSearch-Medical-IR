    "abstract": "Although there have been significant advances in the care of many of the extrapancreatic manifestations of diabetes, acute myocardial infarction continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Factors unique to diabetes increase atherosclerotic plaque formation and thrombosis, thereby contributing to myocardial infarction. Autonomic neuropathy may predispose to infarction and result in atypical presenting symptoms in the diabetic patient, making diagnosis difficult and delaying treatment. The clinical course of myocardial infarction is frequently complicated and carries a higher mortality rate in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic patient. Although the course and pathophysiology of myocardial infarction differ to some degree in diabetic patients from those in patients without diabetes, much more remains to be known to formulate more effective treatment strategies in this high risk subgroup.",
