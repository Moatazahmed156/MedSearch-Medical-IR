    "title": "A Challenging Decision: Identifying and Managing Hepatic Hydrothorax in the Setting of a Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor.",
    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms composed of neuroendocrine cells and seen in approximately 2% of malignancies in the United States. These are often underdiagnosed due to nonspecific presentations early in the disease course. Although found primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas, these tumors can be seen anywhere in the body. The following case highlights an unusual presentation of a NET and subsequent management of hepatic hydrothorax in the setting of obstruction rather than decompensated liver cirrhosis.",
