    "summary": "",
    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment demonstrates great immunophenotypic heterogeneity, which has been leveraged in traditional immune-hot/cold tumor categorization based on the abundance of intra-tumoral immune cells. By incorporating the spatial immune contexture, the tumor immunophenotype was further elaborated into immune-inflamed, immune-excluded, and immune-desert. However, the mechanisms underlying these different immune phenotypes are yet to be comprehensively elucidated. In this review, we discuss how tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment interact collectively to shape the immune landscape from the perspectives of tumor cells, immune cells, the extracellular matrix, and cancer metabolism, and we summarize potential therapeutic options according to distinct immunophenotypes for personalized precision medicine.",
