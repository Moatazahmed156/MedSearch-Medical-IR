    "title": "[Risks of acute kidney injury with intravascular administration of an iodine-containing contrast agent in patients with acute pyelonephritis].",
    "abstract": "The occurrence of acute kidney damage associated with the introduction of an iodine-containing contrast agent into the vascular bed, which leads to transient or persistent structural and functional changes in nephrons, endothelial cells, and renal tubule epithelium, is an urgent problem in modern instrumental diagnostics of various pathological processes, since iodine-containing preparations have a strong advantage over \"native\" scanning. A researcher who uses different techniques depending on the tasks set opens up great prospects in studying many aspects of the structure and function of tissues. New technologies are being actively introduced into clinical practice, with the possibility of selective visualization of small visceral vessels not only using subtractive angiography, but also selective CT angiography/venography. In foreign and domestic literature, the main emphasis is placed on the development of acute kidney damage when using iodine-containing contrast agents in \"compromised\" patients with chronic structural disorders in the kidneys, with evidence that the risks of acute damage are high in chronic renal failure. As for acute disorders - in some cases with complicated forms of pyelonephritis, life-threatening situations, CT with contrast enhancement and alternative methods of selectiveangiographyand renal arteries in combination treatmentis extremely necessary.",
