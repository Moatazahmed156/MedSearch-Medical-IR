    "title": "Neonatal Platelets Differentiate Monocytes to a Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell Phenotype.",
    "abstract": "Adult platelets are relatively enriched in immune related molecules compared to neonatal platelets, but neonatal platelets express some growth factors and enzymes at comparatively higher levels. This makes a prediction of platelet-immune cell interaction outcomes in neonates a challenge, as they are likely dependent on the cell type and tissue environment at the time of injury or infection. Our past studies revealed that the transfusion of adult but not neonatal platelets into thrombocytopenic neonatal mice led to an acute increase in monocyte trafficking. We have now found that neonatal, but not adult platelets, induce monocytes to a Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell (MDSC) phenotype, typified by increased PD-L1, that limits T-cell activation ",
