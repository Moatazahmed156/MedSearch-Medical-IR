    "title": "Overexpression of GM3 and Ganglioside Pattern Remodeling in Lung Adenocarcinoma Brain Metastases Identified by Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most prevalent subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), commonly metastasizes to the brain, particularly in advanced stages. Since brain metastases (BMs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in LUAD patients, their early detection is critical, necessitating the identification of reliable biomarkers. Gangliosides (GGs), a class of bioactive glycosphingolipids involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and immune regulation, have emerged as promising candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in LUAD-associated brain metastases (BMLA). In this context, ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) was employed here to analyze GG alterations in BMLA tissues compared to healthy cerebellar control. The results revealed marked differences, including a reduction in the total number of species, altered sialylation profiles, and variations in fatty acid chain length and sphingoid base hydroxylation. GM3, a monosialodihexosylganglioside, was significantly overexpressed in BMLA, supporting its role in tumor progression via immune evasion and oncogenic signaling. Elevated levels of the brain-specific GT1 ganglioside further point to its possible role as a metastasis-associated biomarker, while the presence of asialogangliosides, absent in normal brain, suggests adaptation to the brain microenvironment. Structural modifications such as ",
