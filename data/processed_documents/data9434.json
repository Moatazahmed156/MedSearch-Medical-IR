    "abstract": "Vitamin B12 (B12) is a strong antioxidant and a cofactor for methionine synthase supporting DNA/RNA/protein methylation. We previously demonstrated that oral high-dose B12 supplement mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy in Akita diabetic mice expressing twice the normal levels of Elmo1 (Engulfment and cell motility 1). To assess how B12 prevents early kidney damage, we treated ",
