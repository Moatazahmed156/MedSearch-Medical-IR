    "abstract": "Cadherin (CDH)-mediated extracellular homophilic binding is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis. The epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecule cadherin 1 (CDH1/E-cadherin) forms the adherens junctions in epithelial cells, and the loss of CDH1 facilitates the migration and invasion of carcinoma cells. Although several anti-CDH1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are available for western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC), a highly sensitive anti-CDH1 mAb suitable for flow cytometry has not been developed. We developed anti-CDH1 mAbs through a flow cytometry-based high-throughput screening. Two anti-CDH1 mAb clones, Ca",
