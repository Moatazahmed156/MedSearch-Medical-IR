    "title": "Tuberculosis among foreign-born populations in the Western Pacific Region: emerging trends and analysis from 2008 to 2023.",
    "abstract": "Migration significantly influences tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology in the Western Pacific Region (WPR), posing challenges to its control and elimination. This study examines the burden of TB among foreign-born individuals at regional and national levels in the WPR. Using data from the WHO Global TB Database and the United Nations' International Migrant Stock dataset, we analysed the number and proportion of foreign-born TB case notifications across the region from 2008 to 2023. We also compared estimated TB incidence among international migrants with regional and national averages in WPR destinations. Foreign-born TB notifications increased from 5,639 in 2008 to 10,056 in 2023, with trends varying across the WPR. Malaysia (40.4%), Japan (16.0%), and Australia (12.7%) accounted for the largest caseloads in 2023. Between 2021 and 2023, foreign-born TB cases represented 0.8% of total case notifications in the region, with Australia (89.9%), and New Zealand (86.5%) reporting the highest proportions. As of 2020, international migrants in the WPR (24.8 million, 77.9% of whom originated from high-burden countries) had an estimated TB incidence rate of 130 per 100,000, exceeding national averages in many countries and areas. Significant disparities remain in the foreign-born TB burden across the WPR. Strengthening surveillance, improving data comparability, and enhancing cross-border collaboration through migrant-sensitive approaches may help address existing gaps and support progress towards the End TB targets.",
