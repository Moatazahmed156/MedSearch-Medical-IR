    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Few studies have investigated the needs of head and neck surgery trainees and areas for improvement of fellowship programs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a qualitative study by interviewing a nationally representative sample of program directors and national leaders in head and neck surgery. We asked about the current state and strengths of training; and areas for further improvement. All interviews were independently coded and analyzed by two reviewers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All experts (100%) believed that the current training provides a strong foundation and furthermore, a standardized curriculum is beneficial. Multidisciplinary training (80%), participation in tumor boards (75%), and a syllabus (60%) were the most frequently mentioned components. Most believed that a formal certification process would be beneficial (73%), though there was no consensus on the format.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Experts in head and neck surgery are generally in favor of a standardized curriculum. Further discussions of a formal certification process might be warranted.",
