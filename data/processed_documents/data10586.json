    "abstract": "The association between Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) and childhood asthma remains controversial, with limited systematic synthesis. This study aimed to integrate global observational evidence to evaluate the relationship between HDP [and its subtypes, pre-eclampsia (PE) and gestational hypertension (GH)] and offspring asthma risk, while exploring sources of heterogeneity. Following PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE guidelines, 20 observational studies ( HDP exposure significantly increased childhood asthma risk (pooled OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.14-1.26,  HDP (particularly PE) exposure is significantly associated with increased offspring asthma risk, with age- and region-specific heterogeneity. Future multicenter cohorts should validate causality and explore subtype-specific mechanisms and interventions for early asthma prevention. PROSPERO 2025 CRD420251052620.",
