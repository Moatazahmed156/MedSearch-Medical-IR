    "title": "Transcript Imbalance from TENM4 Exon Skipping: Effects on Epilepsy and Genetic Pleiotropy.",
    "abstract": "TENM4 is a transmembrane protein belonging to the teneurin family. It is localized in neurons and oligodendrocytes, where it regulates oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. While missense variants of TENM4 were reported to cause essential tremor and schizophrenia, we identified a novel variant of uncertain significance at the exon 10-intron 10 junction, c.1255+2T>C, which was segregated in affected patients with a pedigree of intellectual disability and epilepsy. Minigene assay confirmed that the variant caused an in-frame skipping of exon 10 (ΔE10). To clarify the etiology of the novel variant, we generated a mouse model, Tenm4",
