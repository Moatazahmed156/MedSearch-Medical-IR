However, the spatial organization of TAS subpopulations and their clinical relevance in human colorectal cancer (CRC) are incompletely understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex imaging, we identified multiple TAS subpopulations with distinct intratumoral and peritumoral abundance, and found that CRC patients enriched in FAP",
