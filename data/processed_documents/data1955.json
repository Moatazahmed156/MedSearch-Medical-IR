    "abstract": "The meridian diseases, abnormal psoas and abdominal muscles and abdominal pressure are key causes of low back pain. We treat low back pain mainly with lumbar back area, neglecting abdomen. The anterior-posterior acupoint combination, regulating yin to treat yang, is effective. Based on the Chinese meridian-collateral and contemporary anatomy related to low back pain, the combination method, tuina and its mechanism are introduced, so as to develop the thought and method for low back pain. A typical case is added.",
