    "abstract": "Reductions in brain insulin sensitivity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) have emerged as potential factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. However, no work has tested whether a single bout of exercise can raise brain insulin sensitivity in at-risk adults. The aim of the study was to test whether a single bout of exercise raises brain insulin sensitivity in middle-aged to older adults with cardiometabolic risk. In a counterbalanced pilot study design, 15 cognitively unimpaired (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 28.2 ± 1.3 a.u.) adults [56.7 ± 2.1 years old; maximal oxygen consumption ( ",
