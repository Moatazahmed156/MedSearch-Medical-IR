    "abstract": "Human exposure to metal(loid)s has dramatically increased over the past five decades, which has triggered public concern worldwide. Recently, gut microbiota has been considered a target for metal(loid)s, and some literature has reviewed the interactions between gut microbiota and heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) with high toxicity. However, whether there is an interaction between gut microbiota and metal(loid)s with essential roles or some normal functions are far from clear to date. Importantly, in addition to traditional probiotics that have been clarified to alleviate the adverse effect of HMs on the body, some novel probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics may also exhibit comparable or even better abilities of metal(loid) remediation. In this review, we mainly outline and discuss recent research findings on the metal(loid)-gut microbiota interactions and microbiota-related protective strategies.",
