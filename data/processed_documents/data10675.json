    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-13 plays a central role in Type 2 inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and related inflammatory diseases. APG777 is a novel anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody engineered for improved pharmacokinetics and reduced dosing frequency. This first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of APG777 in healthy adults. Forty participants were enrolled in single ascending dose (300-1200 mg) and multiple dose (300 mg × 2) cohorts. APG777 was well tolerated, with only mild-to-moderate treatment-emergent adverse events, predominantly unrelated to the study drug. No serious or severe drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. Following single doses, APG777 exhibited dose-proportional increases in C",
