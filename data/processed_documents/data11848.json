    "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant phyllodes tumors (MPT) are rare, aggressive fibroepithelial breast neoplasms with limited consensus on optimal management. While wide local excision (WLE) with ≥1 cm margins is standard, recurrence remains common, and the role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear.MethodsWe conducted a 28-year retrospective review of 14 histologically confirmed MPTs in 11 patients at a single urban safety-net hospital. Clinical, pathologic, and treatment data were analyzed to assess recurrence, metastasis, and treatment outcomes.ResultsThe median tumor size was 7.6 cm. Most patients (73%) presented with stage II disease. Surgical management included WLE alone (45.5%), WLE with radiation (27.3%), mastectomy alone (9.1%), and mastectomy with adjuvant radiation (18.2%). Local recurrence occurred in 3 patients (27.3%), all of whom were initially treated with surgery alone. Those who recurred received adjuvant radiation; no recurrences occurred after adjuvant radiation. One patient developed metastases and received systemic chemotherapy. Only 1 patient underwent genetic testing, which revealed a ",
