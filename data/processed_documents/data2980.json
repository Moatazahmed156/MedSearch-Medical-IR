They include maturity onset diabetes of the young, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and rare syndromic forms of diabetes. An early and proper diagnosis allows to implement an optimal treatment, leads to improved metabolic control and amelioration of related disabilities as well as increases the quality of life of the patients.",
