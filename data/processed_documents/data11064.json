    "title": "High-intensity inspiratory muscle training and diaphragm thickness in severe COPD: a prospective pilot study.",
    "abstract": "High-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been reported to increase diaphragm thickness in healthy adults, but evidence in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains scarce. This prospective pilot study evaluated the effects of high-intensity IMT on diaphragm thickness and functional outcomes in nine patients with severe COPD who had completed standard respiratory rehabilitation. Participants performed 30 breaths per day at 60 % of maximum inspiratory pressure for 12 weeks. Diaphragm thickness at maximum inspiration increased from 4.7 to 5.6 mm, maximum inspiratory pressure from 57.1 to 68.1 cmH",
