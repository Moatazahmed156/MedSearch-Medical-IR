    "abstract": "The relationship between gut microbiome diversity and stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is of interest. Hence, a total of 124 participants, including cognitively normal controls and patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD, were assessed for microbiome composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. Results revealed significantly reduced microbial diversity and altered bacterial profiles, notably lower levels of ",
