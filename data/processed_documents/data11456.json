    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive impairment (CI) and its related risk factors (e.g., diabetes and stroke) are highly prevalent among Hispanic/Latinos (H/L); however, prior research in H/L focused on aging individuals (≥65 years old).ObjectiveTo comprehensively assess the associations between a wide-range of cardiometabolic health indicators and CI using a prospective study design in a younger cohort of H/L (majority <65 years old) from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC).MethodsWe identified a total of 1240 CCHC subjects with complete Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) data at study baseline and at 5-year follow-up. The outcome (i.e., CI) was based on MMSE scores of less than 24. We conducted univariate associations for multiple cardiometabolic indicators with CI; and mixed logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios for the associations between cardiometabolic indicators and CI adjusted for age, education, prior stroke, and ",
