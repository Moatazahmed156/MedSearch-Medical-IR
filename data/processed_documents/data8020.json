    "abstract": "Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are benign, slow-growing tumors of the eighth cranial nerve. Sporadic unilateral VSs constitute approximately 95% of all newly diagnosed tumors. There is little known about risk factors for developing sporadic unilateral VS. Potential risk factors that have been reported are familial or genetic risk, noise exposure, cell phone use, and ionizing radiation, whereas protective factors may include smoking and aspirin use. More research is needed to elucidate the risk factors for development of these rare tumors.",
