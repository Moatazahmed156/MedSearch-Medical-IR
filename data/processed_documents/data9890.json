    "abstract": "BackgroundThe association between open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the association between OAG and EOAD.MethodsWe conducted a case-control study using a Japanese nationwide administrative claims database. Individuals aged 40-64 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a prescription for AD medications were defined as EOAD cases (n = 2344). The index date was the first AD medication prescription. Controls (n = 9376) were matched to cases in a 4:1 ratio by age and sex using risk set sampling. OAG exposure was defined as a diagnosis ≥12 months before the index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsOAG was present in 15.8% of EOAD cases and 12.5% of controls. A significant association was observed between OAG and EOAD (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40; p = 0.006). EOAD was associated with diabetes (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.37-1.77; p < 0.001), hypertension (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29; p = 0.021), depression (OR, 7.81; 95% CI, 6.76-9.02; p < 0.001), and excessive alcohol use (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.72-3.21; p < 0.001). In sex-stratified analyses, the association between OAG and EOAD was significant in males (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60; p = 0.005) but not in females (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90-1.37; p = 0.321).ConclusionsIndividuals with OAG may be associated with an increased risk of EOAD, and careful monitoring of cognitive symptoms may help facilitate early detection and intervention.",
