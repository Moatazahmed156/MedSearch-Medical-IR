    "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ), caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), poses a significant health risk, particularly for individuals over 50 and immunocompromised patients. The adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine offers over 90% protection and is recommended for adults ≥60 years and at-risk individuals ≥50 years. It is effective and safe, even for immunosuppressed patients. To ensure adherence to the full vaccination schedule and long-lasting protection, patients should be informed about possible vaccine reactions and the necessity of the second dose.",
