    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis, which can progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, presents a significant health challenge. This study evaluates the effects of two l-glutaminase (GLS) inhibitors, Telaglenastat (CB-839) and compound 968, on carbon tetrachloride (CCl Sixty rats were divided into six groups: control, CB-839, 968, CCl CCl These findings demonstrate that CB-839 exhibits significant antifibrotic effects in a rat model of liver fibrosis, primarily by modulating glutamine metabolism and key fibrotic biomarkers. CB-839 has the potential to be a promising therapeutic approach for liver fibrosis.",
