    "abstract": "Brain radiotherapy (RT) combined with immunotherapy is standard for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases. However, RT-induced hematologic toxicities (HTs) can cause treatment interruption and lymphopenia, potentially impairing immunotherapy efficacy. As the skull bone marrow has recently been identified as a key hematopoietic site, this study evaluated the impact of skull RT dose on HTs in NSCLC patients undergoing cranial RT and immunotherapy. This retrospective study consecutively included 191 NSCLC patients with brain metastases treated between June 2018 and April 2023. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), was selected based on lesion characteristics. All doses were converted to equivalent 2-Gy fractions (EQD2). HTs were graded by CTCAE v5.0. Skull dosimetric parameters (Dmean HT3+ occurred in 18.8% (36/191) of patients, with neutropenia (18.9%), leukopenia (15.2%), and lymphopenia (15.7%) being most frequent. Multivariate analysis, adjusting for age and other covariates, revealed significant associations between HT3+ and Dmean Higher skull radiation doses significantly increase severe HTs in NSCLC patients receiving cranial RT and immunotherapy. Incorporating skull dose constraints may mitigate HTs, preserve lymphocytes, and enhance immunotherapy efficacy, warranting validation in prospective studies.",
