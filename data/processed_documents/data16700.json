    "title": "Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Epilepsy.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) are specialized regions in cells where the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria closely interact. MAMs are enriched with a variety of proteins that regulate key cellular processes. These processes include mitochondrial fission and fusion, autophagy, lipid metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and oxidative stress. Increasing evidence suggests that disruption of MAMs structure and alterations in associated protein expression patterns are closely related to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This review synthesizes and analyzes current literature to outline the structural and functional roles of key MAMs proteins. It further examines experimental and clinical evidence linking MAMs dysregulation to epileptogenesis and treatment responses. The analysis confirms that MAMs serve as a central hub coordinating cellular homeostasis. Specific alterations in MAMs structure and protein expression are consistently associated with epilepsy models. These alterations directly impact neuronal excitability, synaptic function, and cell survival pathways involved in disease progression. Addressing these structural and functional properties of MAMs may provide valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.",
