    "title": "IL-18 potentiates platelet activation and thrombosis through IL-18Rα-dependent MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling.",
    "abstract": "Arterial thrombosis is a leading cause of global cardiovascular mortality. Clinical evidence indicates that elevated IL-18 levels independently predict cardiovascular events, yet its direct role in thrombosis is poorly understood. Hence, targeting IL-18 could be a novel therapeutic strategy. This study investigated the mechanism of IL-18 in platelet activation and evaluated the antithrombotic efficacy of interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Through in vitro and in vivo models, including Il18r1",
