    "abstract": "Wound healing is an important topic in modern medicine across many disciplines. Healing of all cutaneous wounds, whether accidentally sustained or intentionally created, requires the common yet complex set of interactions between the immune, circulatory, nervous, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Deficits in any of these systems or the molecular factors that mediate their communications can contribute to impaired healing of cutaneous wounds. While the stages of wound repair, angiogenesis, growth factors, and cytokines involved have been extensively studied, the role of the cutaneous nervous system in wound healing has not been well outlined. We have provided a basic overview of cutaneous innervation and wound repair for the dermatologic surgeon by outlining the normal cutaneous nervous anatomy and function and discussing the most important neuropeptides that mediate the wound healing process.",
