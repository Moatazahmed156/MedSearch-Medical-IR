    "abstract": "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is a neurological disorder involving visual and perceptual distortions, such as altered size perception, sensations of levitation, and time distortion. Initially linked to migraines and epileptic seizures, AIWS has been associated later with tumors, infections, and both illicit and prescribed drugs. This study explores drug-related AIWS cases in the WHO global pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase®, with a focus on age-specific patterns. We queried VigiBase® for AIWS reports until December 15, 2024 and categorized them into pediatric and adult groups. Disproportionality analyses identified drug-AIWS associations using the lower bound of the confidence interval of the Information Component (IC",
