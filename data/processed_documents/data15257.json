    "abstract": "In Israel, irregular migrants (IMs) living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) that have no access to regular health insurance are provided with HIV-1-related health coverage under a public-private partnership (PPP) program initiated by the Ministry of Health in 2014. Here we characterized IMs referred to the PPP in 2019-2024 and used a linear mixed-effects model to follow up their CD4 and HIV-1 viral load (VL) counts for a median period of 16 months. Subtypes, resistance mutations and phylogenetic relationships were determined in all cases with viral failure and in selected cases with available blood remains. A total of 231 of 238 referred to the PPP initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs, 61.5%, 142/231) or protease inhibitors (PIs, 38.5%, 89/231). Irrespective of the treatment regimen, all these individuals increased their CD4 and decreased their VL trajectories over time (",
