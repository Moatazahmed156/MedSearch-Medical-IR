    "abstract": "Yellow alert: the Children's Liver Disease Foundation has launched a campaign to help emergency nurses and other healthcare professionals recognise and take action on neonatal liver disease. Backed by the RCN, the Yellow Alert campaign highlights the key signs and symptoms of the potentially fatal condition: jaundice of the skin beyond two weeks in term babies and three weeks in preterm babies, yellow urine, pale stools, and yellowing of the sclera of the eyes, a key tool in detecting jaundice in all ethnic and racial groups. Foundation chief executive Catherine Arkley said: 'The signs of neonatal liver disease are simple and visual but they are often overlooked, particularly as the baby can look and feed well.' For free campaign packs, email yellowalert@childliverdisease.org or call 0121 212 3839.",
