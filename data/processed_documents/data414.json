    "abstract": "Despite a high incidence of hematologic malignancies in older adults, available data indicate that there is disproportionately low representation of adults ≥65 years with hematologic malignancies (greater in patients ≥75 years) in clinical trials. Biological and clinical differences between older and younger adults and diversity within older patients necessitate adequate representation of the older subpopulation in hematologic malignancy trials. This would allow trial results to be generalizable and inform treatment decisions in the older patient population. Restrictive eligibility criteria may be barriers to adequate representation, as older adults do not typically meet these criteria. Efforts to broaden eligibility criteria in clinical trials have been proposed and may promote enrollment of a representative older population with hematologic malignancies. Collaboration among a diverse group of stakeholders will be needed to implement current proposals and evaluate their impact on increasing representation of older adults in trials evaluating therapies for hematologic malignancies.",
