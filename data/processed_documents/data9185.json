    "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, has a poor prognosis despite standard treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) play a critical role in recurrence and therapy resistance. Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as innovative approaches, leveraging the tumor-targeting abilities of stem cells to deliver treatments directly to GBM.\n    \n\n\n          Areas covered:\n        \n      \n      This review focuses on using intact stem cells or subtypes for GBM therapy, excluding antigenic characteristics. The stem cell-based therapies explored include neural, mesenchymal, glioblastoma, hematopoietic and adipose-derived stem cells that have been investigated in both clinical and preclinical settings. A systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus had identified research up until January 2024. Key mechanisms reviewed include immune modulation, angiogenesis inhibition, and apoptosis induction. Discussion of completed and ongoing trials include emphasis on safety, efficacy, challenges, and study design limitations.\n    \n\n\n          Expert opinion:\n        \n      \n      Stem cell-based therapies hold promise for treating GBM by targeting GSCs and improving treatment outcomes. Despite some potential advantages, challenges such as tumorigenesis risks, delivery complexities, and sustained therapeutic effects persist. Future research should prioritize optimizing stem cell modifications, combining them with current treatments, and conducting large-scale trials to ensure safety and efficacy. Integrating stem cell therapies into GBM treatment could provide more effective and less invasive options for patients.",
