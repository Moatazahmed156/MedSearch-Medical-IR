However, there is currently no consensus on the most accurate instrument for assessing clinical outcomes following the occurrence of such complications in cardiac surgery. The objective was to validate the comprehensive complication index (CCI This retrospective study included 1896 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery between September 2023 and October 2024. Among these patients, 849 developed postoperative complications. Complications were graded using the CDC, which were then converted to the CCI The median age of the patients was 58.0 years; the median CCI Both the CCI",
