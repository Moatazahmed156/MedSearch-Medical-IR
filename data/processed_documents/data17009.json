    "abstract": "SYNGAP1 regulates synaptic plasticity through interactions with scaffold proteins and modulation of Ras and Rap GTPase signaling. Human SYNGAP1 mutations are linked to intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism. In mice, Syngap1 haploinsufficiency causes impaired LTP, premature maturation of dendritic spines, learning disabilities, and seizures, reflecting the human phenotypes of SYNGAP1 syndrome. Recently, SYNGAP1 was shown to influence cortical neurogenesis and progenitor proliferation in human organoids. Here, we show that Syngap1 absence or haploinsufficiency does not alter neocortical progenitors and their cellular output in mice. Despite careful analysis of cortical progenitor properties, we fail to replicate the main findings from human organoids. This discrepancy suggests species-specific or methodological differences and raises questions about the broader relevance of SYNGAP1's role in neurogenesis. The absence of cortical progenitor deficits in haploinsufficient mice, which exhibit cognitive deficits and seizures, indicates these arise from SYNGAP1's regulation of synapse function rather than its role on neurogenesis.",
