    "title": "MSC-Exosomes as Novel Therapeutics in Asthma and Allergic Airway Inflammation.",
    "abstract": "Allergic respiratory diseases, including asthma and allergic rhinitis, are chronic inflammatory diseases that affect millions of people worldwide and constitute a significant health problem. Preclinical studies using both systemic and intranasal administration of MSC-Exos have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits. In murine models of allergic airway inflammation, treatment with MSC-Exos resulted in reduced eosinophilic infiltration, decreased serum IgE levels, and suppression of mucus hypersecretion. These effects were accompanied by enhanced secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β, two key anti-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. MSC-Exos represent an innovative and safe therapeutic platform for allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma and rhinitis. By combining the regenerative and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs with the advantages of a cell-free system, they effectively regulate Th2 cytokines and restore immune balance. Future research should prioritize the scalable production and bioengineering optimization of MSC-Exos to enhance their stability, targeting efficiency, and bioactivity. Advances in exosome surface modification, such as ligand conjugation or genetic engineering of parent MSCs, may further improve selective delivery to inflamed airway tissues. Additionally, large-scale clinical trials are necessary to confirm therapeutic efficacy, establish optimal administration routes (e.g., intranasal vs. systemic), and ensure long-term safety. Beyond allergic airway diseases, the versatility of MSC-Exos may extend to other inflammatory and fibrotic lung conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. As understanding of exosome biology deepens and bioengineering techniques advance, MSC-Exos are poised to become a cornerstone of next-generation immunomodulatory and regenerative therapies, bridging molecular biology, nanotechnology, and clinical immunology for transformative outcomes in respiratory medicine.",
