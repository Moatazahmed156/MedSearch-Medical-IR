    "abstract": "The dynamic interaction between the heart and lungs leads to a degree of respiratory co-morbidity including both restrictive and obstructive airway abnormalities, which may be overlooked in children with congenital and acquired heart disease. The improving imaging techniques of the heart, both foetal and post-natal coupled with minimally invasive techniques for device implantation and better operative techniques for complex congenital heart disease have resulted in more children with longitudinally documented structural heart disease surviving into their adult years. Children presenting with cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias, as well as those with repaired cardiac disease, can be offered advice with regard to formal exercise testing and participation in sports, which may be particularly helpful in the adolescent years. Furthermore, through the interest of some adult cardiologists in paediatric heart disease over the past 20 years, facilities for the smooth transition of care to adult services are improving.",
