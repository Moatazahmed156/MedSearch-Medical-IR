    "title": "Protein Misfolding in the Pathogenesis and Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases (Review).",
    "abstract": "This review systematizes existing data on protein misfolding in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (with a focus on α-synuclein, β-amyloid, and tau protein). Modern laboratory and neuroimaging methods used for clinical diagnosis and scientific research of proteinopathies are discussed. The paper describes promising protein amplification techniques that enable the detection of ultra-low concentrations of aberrant protein forms in biological fluids. The challenges and prospects of early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases through protein misfolding detection are also shown.",
