    "abstract": "This study explores the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding the sexual health of breast cancer patients among nurses in Nanjing, China. Conducted from June to July 2023 across six hospitals, this web-based cross-sectional study utilized a self-administered questionnaire, resulting in 252 valid responses, predominantly from female nurses (98.41%). The mean scores indicated inadequate knowledge (8.82 ± 5.33), a positive attitude (38.43 ± 5.23), and inactive practice (27.75 ± 6.68) regarding patients' sexual health. Multivariate logistic regression identified that the lack of training on breast cancer sexual health was significantly associated with lower knowledge (OR = 0.31,  Overall, nurses demonstrated a need for improved knowledge and active practices concerning the sexual health of breast cancer patients.",
