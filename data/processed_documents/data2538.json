    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis has an estimated prevalence of 10-20% in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, making it the most common cause of chronic anterior uveitis in children. Prompt treatment is important to prevent development of ocular complications and permanent vision loss. In this review, we will discuss the use of immunosuppression in treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. This will include the use of conventional immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, biologic anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, such as adalimumab, as well as other anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, including infliximab and golimumab. In addition, we will discuss medications currently in clinical trials or under consideration for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, including interleukin-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab) and Janus kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib).",
