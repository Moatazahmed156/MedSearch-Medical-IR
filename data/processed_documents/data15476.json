    "title": "Tuberculosis incidence among people living with HIV in Israel: a 42-year follow-up study.",
    "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLHIV) who are co-infected with tuberculosis are at risk for negative health outcomes. This study describes tuberculosis incidence in Israel and identifies high-risk groups. This 42-year study includes all tuberculosis cases reported in Israel after HIV-diagnosis. Fine-Gray models were adjusted to three timeframes, according to the availability of anti-retroviral treatment (ART): 1981-1996 (pre-ART), 1997-2016 (ART), 2017-2023 (immediate ART upon detection). Of all 12,004 PLHIV, 413 (3.4%) developed tuberculosis: 132 (7.4%) between 1981 and 1996; 263 (3.6%) between 1997 and 2016; and 18 (0.6%) between 2017 and 2023, p<0.001. Non-Israeli-born citizens PLHIV were at higher risk for developing tuberculosis compared with Israeli-born citizens (0.5 vs. 0.05 per 100 person-years, respectively, p<0.001). Risk factors for developing tuberculosis among 6933 Israeli PLHIV included being heterosexual, originating in endemic countries (Hazard ratio [HR] 17.8, 95% CI: 9.7-32.6, p<0.01), intra-venous drug users (IVDU) (HR=12.9, 95% CI: 6.8-24.5, p<0.01), and being diagnosed with HIV in 1981-1996 and 1997-2016 (HR=5.6, 95% CI: 2.3-13.9, p<0.01 and HR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.0-6.0, p=0.05, respectively). Tuberculosis incidence among PLHIV was highest among migrants from endemic countries and IVDU. Tuberculosis incidence declined after the introduction of ART and was further reduced when ART was provided immediately upon detection.",
