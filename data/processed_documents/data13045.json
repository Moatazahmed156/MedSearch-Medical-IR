    "abstract": "Proteostasis dysfunction is a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the genetic and molecular pathways that disrupt protein homeostasis remain poorly understood. We integrated human genetics, transcriptomics, and functional studies to identify proteostasis network components involved in tauopathy. We identified 18 proteostasis network genes harboring 75 rare, damaging variants enriched in FTD and/or AD. These genes, spanning multiple proteostasis pathways, were differentially expressed in  Our findings identify a set of proteostasis genes with genetic and transcriptional links to neurodegeneration and reveal ",
