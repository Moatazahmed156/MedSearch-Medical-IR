    "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition and requires prompt recognition and timely initiation of treatment. We aimed to define EEG characteristics in initial ictal EEG recordings predicting response to 1 All adult patients diagnosed with SE between 2018 and 2022 were screened for inclusion. The following inclusion criteria applied: baseline EEG demonstrating SE recorded within 48 h from symptom onset and without prior administration of 3 Of the 50 patients included in our study, 22 (44 %) responded to 1 Spectral power analysis of initial SE EEG can help to stratify the risk of rSE development and facilitate timely targeted therapy with the aim to improve clinical outcome of affected patients.",
