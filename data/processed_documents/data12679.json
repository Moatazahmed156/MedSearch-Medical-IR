    "title": "VA1213, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, exhibits antitumor activity by suppressing EGFR, AKT, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",
    "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in various cancers and has emerged as a promising target in oncological pharmacotherapy. This study investigates the in vitro antitumor properties and mechanism of action of novel vicinal diaryl-substituted heterocyclic COX-2 inhibitors, with a focus on VA1213, in comparison to celecoxib, a widely marketed COX-2 inhibitor known for its off-target effects. We assessed cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, cell-cycle distribution, antimetastatic activity, and alterations in key signaling pathways in HT-29 colorectal carcinoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell lines. Among the novel compounds, VA1213 exhibited the most potent growth-inhibitory activity, demonstrating time-dependent cytotoxicity with a lower IC",
