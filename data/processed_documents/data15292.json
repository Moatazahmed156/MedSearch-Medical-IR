    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge in China. Meigu County, in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is severely affected by a high TB burden, a situation exacerbated by its geographic isolation and socioeconomic constraints. This study used DNA microarray technology to assess drug resistance in 378  This study provided a critically important investigation into the molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Meigu County, a remote and high-burden region in Sichuan Province, China. By combining DNA microarray chip technology and whole-genome sequencing, the researchers characterized the genetic makeup, drug resistance patterns, and transmission dynamics of strains of ",
