CAD patients show increased platelet activation, but its prognostic relevance remains unexplored. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of platelet-activation markers on mortality in CAD patients.Surface expression of platelet-associated activated GPIIbIIIa, P-selectin, tissue factor (TF), and platelet-leukocyte aggregate was analyzed in 527 CAD patients (acute coronary syndromes [ACS, ",
