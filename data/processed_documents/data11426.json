    "abstract": "In this study, the neurorehabilitation potential of combined and isolated intermittent hypercapnia and hypoxia exposure was evaluated following photochemically induced cerebral thrombosis in rats. Particular attention was given to the roles of possible neuroplasticity mechanisms mediated by VEGF and BDNF, as well as the potential of hypercapnic-hypoxic interventions to synergistically amplify the therapeutic effects of pharmacological neuroprotectants during recovery. A total of 50 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five equal groups (",
