    "title": "Peri-renal and sinus fat accumulation and diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: A Japanese cohort study.",
    "abstract": "This 15-year cohort study assessed whether peri-renal fat volume index (PRFVI) and renal sinus fat volume index (RSFVI) predict diabetic kidney disease (DKD) better than general or abdominal obesity measures in Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Researchers studied 190 DKD-free patients, measured their abdominal and renal fat via computed tomography, and categorized them into tertiles based on five adiposity indices: BMI, visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), PRFVI, and RSFVI. Participants averaged 58 years old; 52.6 % were male with a median diabetes duration of 5 years and a BMI of 25.4 kg/m The findings demonstrate that PRFVI, particularly RSFVI, provides incremental predictive value independent of conventional DKD risk variables, suggesting that local renal fat may be a target for early DKD detection and intervention in people with T2D.",
