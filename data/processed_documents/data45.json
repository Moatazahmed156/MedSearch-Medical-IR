    "abstract": "Olfaction acuity, which includes detection thresholds, discrimination and identification, appears to decline with age, obesity, and various neurological disorders. Knowing that smell influences energy intake, there is a growing interest in protecting this sense. Physical activity could be a key intervention to counteract the loss of olfaction. This systematic review aims to explore the literature on the effect of physical activity on olfaction acuity. The search strategy consisted of using index terms and keywords in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science search engine. Data from 17 trials involving 10,861 participants showed that physical activity improved olfaction thresholds, discrimination, identification and perceived intensity. Regular practice of physical activity seemed to have better effects on olfaction components than acute exercise. Although this review has clarified the evidence on the effects of physical activity on olfaction, better methodological consistency is needed.",
