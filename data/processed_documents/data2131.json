    "abstract": "Spinal cord tumors are best identified by conventional MR imaging with contrast. Most intramedullary spinal cord tumors have characteristic MR imaging features that allow an accurate preoperative diagnosis. The spinal cord tumors reviewed in this article include the most common tumors, ependymomas and astrocytomas, as well as the less common tumors such as hemangioblastomas and metastases. Rare tumors such as primary CNS lymphoma and melanocytic tumors are also described. Advanced imaging techqniques of more common intramedullary tumors are also reviewed.",
