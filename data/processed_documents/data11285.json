    "title": "The cribriform plate: A dynamic central nervous system-immune hub.",
    "abstract": "Olfactory nerve bundles exit the brain through the cribriform plate (CP) with a rich perineural microenvironment (cpPME). This microenvironment facilitates interactions between cerebrospinal fluid, blood vessels, bone marrow, and lymphatic vessels. The immune niche of the cpPME changes in response to inflammation caused by stroke, autoimmunity, infection, and Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation at the CP results in dysfunction of olfaction that might have diagnostic value in neurological disorders. Additionally, the proximity of the CP to the nasal mucosa allows targeted therapeutic interventions. A thorough understanding of the cpPME is essential for designing innovative diagnostics and treatments for neuroinflammatory diseases.",
