    "abstract": "Noncirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) refers to a diverse group of disorders that affects the hepatic portosinusoidal vascular system resulting in portal hypertension (PH). Unlike cirrhosis, there are no noninvasive criteria to diagnose PH and varices in NCPH. A prospective cohort of patients with NCPH who had transjugular liver biopsy, liver stiffness (LSM) measured using transient elastography, and laboratory and imaging data were included. PH was defined by the presence of one among the following-varices on endoscopy, portosystemic collaterals, or ascites on imaging. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors. The classification tree approach was used to identify cutoff values for the stepwise decision model. Of the 59 patients, 41 (69%) had PH and 36 (62%) had varices. LSM was higher in patients with PH (11.5 kPa vs 5.7 kPa, P < 0.01) and varices (12 kPa vs 5.9 kPa, P < 0.01). Platelet count was lower in patients with PH (79 vs 218 × 109/L, P < 0.01) and varices (75 vs 209 × 109/L, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis combining LSM and platelet count predicts PH (area under receiver operating characteristic 96% [91%-99%]) and varices (area under receiver operating characteristic 92% [85%-99%]). A stepwise model combining platelet 140 × 109/L and LSM 7 kPa performed with a sensitivity of 100%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 90% to detect PH. The same model performed with sensitivity of 100%, negative predictive value of 100%, and accuracy of 81% to detect varices. Noninvasive model combining LSM with platelet count can aid in identifying NCPH patients with PH and varices. However, this model requires validation in an independent cohort.",
