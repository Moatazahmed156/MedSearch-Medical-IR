    "abstract": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a crippling autoimmune disease characterized by gradual cartilage loss, bone degeneration, and persistent joint inflammation. Widespread adverse effects and ineffective drug distribution hamper the traditional treatment modalities. Recent progress in RA treatment has been advanced by nanocarrier-based phototherapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). These therapies work by inducing necrosis or apoptosis in inflammatory cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species ",
