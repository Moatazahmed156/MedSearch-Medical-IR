    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed attention to complex chronic health conditions that challenge conventional biomedical paradigms. Syndromes such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome have gained broader visibility through the lens of Long COVID. As global vaccination campaigns expanded, a subset of individuals began reporting similarly persistent, multisystem symptoms following COVID-19 immunization-informally referred to as post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome. These presentations, which include dysautonomia, neuropathic pain, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction, resemble post-infectious syndromes and may involve shared immune-related mechanisms. Although no causal relationship to vaccination has been established, these cases-together with comparable reports following other vaccines-highlight limitations in current vaccine safety systems for detecting and evaluating complex chronic outcomes. This article introduces the concept of complex chronic adverse events following immunization (CC-AEFIs) as a pragmatic, surveillance-oriented framework to support the systematic identification and investigation of such cases. CC-AEFIs are not syndromic diagnoses but a higher-order category encompassing persistent, multifactorial conditions that may follow immunization yet challenge existing pharmacovigilance definitions and tools. These conditions often involve multiple organ systems, delayed onset, fluctuating trajectories, diagnostic ambiguity, and symptom heterogeneity. Drawing on the author's lived experience as an affected patient and integrating clinical, regulatory, and experiential evidence, the analysis examines structural and epistemic limitations across the pharmacovigilance continuum-from underrecognition in clinical settings to analytic exclusion and constrained governance. It concludes by proposing reforms to strengthen safety-system responsiveness, including enhanced diagnostic training, longitudinal surveillance, patient-reported outcome integration, and analytic transparency. Addressing these limitations is essential to sustain public trust, ensure equitable care, and uphold the scientific integrity of immunization programs. Improving vaccine safety systems to better detect and respond to chronic health problems after vaccination - Though vaccines are exceptionally safe and critical for public health, a small number of individuals develop long-lasting and complex health problems after vaccination that are difficult to diagnose and poorly understood. - These problems often involve symptoms such as fatigue, nerve pain, dizziness, heart rhythm issues, or brain fog. They may begin days or weeks after vaccination, affect multiple body systems, and change over time. Because they don’t fit standard medical categories, many people are dismissed or misdiagnosed. - Similar symptoms have also been observed after infections like COVID-19 (known as Long COVID), suggesting that shared immune-related processes may be involved. While a direct causal link to vaccination is not always clear, emerging evidence shows the importance of systematically studying these cases. - Current vaccine safety systems work well to detect short-term or clearly defined side effects like fever or allergic reactions. However, they often miss longer-term, more complex, or delayed conditions that do not follow expected patterns. - This paper introduces a new framework—Complex Chronic Adverse Events Following Immunization (CC-AEFIs)—to help describe, investigate, and monitor these cases more effectively. - It also identifies challenges across the vaccine safety system—from diagnosis to reporting, data analysis, and governance:  - Recognition: These conditions are often dismissed due to lack of clear tests (biomarkers) and a tendency to label symptoms as psychological.  - Reporting: There are widespread underreporting issues, especially for complex or delayed symptoms.  - Analysis: Current systems lack the long-term tracking and comparison data needed to detect rare or complex patterns.  - Governance: Oversight processes are often opaque, influenced by vaccine manufacturers, and rarely include affected individuals. - The paper proposes concrete reforms to make vaccine safety systems more transparent, inclusive, and responsive.",
