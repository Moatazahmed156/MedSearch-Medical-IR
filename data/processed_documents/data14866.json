    "title": "Rifaximin for Primary prophylaxis of Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy After Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: A Cohort Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is linked to an elevated risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), yet evidence supporting primary prophylaxis for post-TIPS OHE remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate whether rifaximin reduces the incidence of post-TIPS OHE in cirrhotic patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 72 patients who received rifaximin (400 mg twice daily) for 6 months after TIPS (rifaximin group). A matched control group (n=72) was recruited from a randomized clinical trial (ChiCTR-INR-17012479). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of OHE within 6 months. Secondary endpoints included 1-year mortality, rebleeding episodes, stent dysfunction, and improvements in liver function. The 6-month incidence of OHE was significantly lower in the rifaximin group (21%, 15/72) than in the control group (40%, 29/72; P=0.011). The risk difference was -19.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -34.2% to -4.7%), with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19-0.82). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly reduced cumulative risk of OHE in the rifaximin group (log-rank P=0.009). No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of mortality, rebleeding, or stent dysfunction (all P>0.05). Six-month rifaximin prophylaxis following TIPS significantly reduced the incidence of early OHE in patients with cirrhosis.",
