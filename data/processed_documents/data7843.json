    "abstract": "The extent of recurrence of original kidney disease after kidney transplantation has been underestimated for several reasons. First, the duration of observation varies among studies. Second, the criteria used to schedule protocol and episode biopsies differ among institutions. And third, diagnostic modalities used for early detection of recurrent original kidney disease also vary. Thus, rates of graft loss attributable to a recurrence of original kidney disease vary among institutions and are often underestimated. However, the recurrence of original disease is often thought to be less important than chronic rejection followed by loss of a functioning allograft. It is important to note that recent data have shown that in patients with certain limited primary kidney diseases (e.g., membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis [MPGN], IgA nephritis [IgAN], focal segmental glomerulonephritis [FSGS], and membranous nephropathy [MN]), the predominant (60%) cause of graft loss is the recurrence of original kidney disease. In addition, the rate of 5-year graft survival in patients with recurrent original kidney disease averages 45%. Thus, research must address the recurrence of original kidney disease. Here we focus on this recurrence and discuss diagnoses, preventive strategies, treatments, and future research directions.",
