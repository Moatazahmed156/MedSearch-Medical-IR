    "abstract": "The review focuses on current data on Alzhemier's dementia, a clinical syndrom characterised with acquired deterioration of cognitive functioning and emotional capacities, which impaires everyday activity and quality of life. Alzheimer's dementia is the most common type of dementia in clinical surveys. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia is primarily based on symptoms and signs and memory impairment is clinically most significant. Cholinesterase inhibitors -donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are considered to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no effective pharmacologic interventions have been researched enough to support their use in prevention of Alzheimer's dementia. Studies suggest that healthy lifestyle, ongoing education, regular physical activity, and cholesterol control, play a role in prevention of Alzheimer's dementia.",
