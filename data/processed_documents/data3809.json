    "abstract": "Since 2019 the world has been in a combat with the highly contagious disease COVID-19 which is caused by the rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Detection of this disease in an early stage helps to control its spread and management. To combat this epidemic with one-time effective medication, improved quick analytical procedures must be developed and validated. The requirement for accurate and precise analytical methods for the diagnosis of the virus and antibodies in infected patients has been a matter of concern. The global impact of this virus has motivated scientists and researchers to investigate and develop various analytical diagnostic techniques. This review includes the study of standard methods which are reliable and accredited for the analytical recognition of the said virus. For early detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, RT-PCR (Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is an accurate method among other methods and, thus, considered as the \"gold standard\" technique. Here, we outline the most extensively used analytical methods for diagnosing COVID-19, along with a brief description of each technique and its analytical aspects/perspective.",
