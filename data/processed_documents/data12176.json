    "abstract": "Carotol, the major sesquiterpene alcohol in carrot essential oil, possesses notable cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its metabolic fate remains poorly understood. This study explored microbial biotransformation as a tool for generating novel carotol derivatives with potential pharmacological value. Seventeen microbial strains were screened, with ",
