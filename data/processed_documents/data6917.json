    "abstract": "The authors describe the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), examining in depth the characteristics of closed head, penetrating, and blast-related TBI. Events on a structural as well as cellular level are reviewed. Blast-related brain injury, in particular, affects military service members preferentially, but is also relevant in cases of industrial accidents as well as terrorist events.",
