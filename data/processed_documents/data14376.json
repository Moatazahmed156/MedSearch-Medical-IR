    "abstract": "While professional antigen-presenting cells drive adaptive immunity, atypical cell types can fulfill this role in the bone marrow. Megakaryocytes (MKs) are canonically recognized for platelet production, but recent studies indicate functional heterogeneity and immune potential. We found that ~20% of bone marrow MKs express Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) II and costimulatory receptors CD80, CD86, and CD40. These MKs process and present antigen to activate T cells in an MHC II-dependent manner. MK-T cell interactions induced TGF-β1 secretion and promoted induced regulatory T cell differentiation. Immunopeptidomics of MK MHC II receptor confirmed occupancy by exogenous peptides, demonstrating in vivo functionality. Using a model with MK-targeted deletion of MHC II ",
