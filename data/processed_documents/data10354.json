Myocardial strain ratio (MSR), derived from  We retrospectively analyzed 70 patients with INOCA who underwent adenosine-stress NH Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified an MSR cutoff of 0.94 for predicting MACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with MSR < 0.94 had a higher incidence of MACE than those with MSR ≥ 0.94 (log-rank P = 0.027). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis confirmed MSR < 0.94 as an independent predictor of MACE in patients with INOCA. NH",
