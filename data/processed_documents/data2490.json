    "abstract": "MRI, ultrasound, and conventional radiography each play distinct roles in the evaluation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), with MRI being the preferred imaging modality of choice for assessing both inflammatory and destructive changes. These various imaging modalities provide valuable insights into JIA in pediatric patients. However, challenges persist in terms of achieving precision, ensuring validity, and distinguishing between pathologic findings and normal anatomic variations. Establishing normal reference values and implementing scoring systems can aid in the precise evaluation of disease activity and provide information to assist treatment decisions for children with JIA. Ongoing advancements in imaging techniques and standardization initiatives aim to bolster the accuracy of JIA diagnosis and assessment, ultimately leading to enhanced patient care and treatment outcomes.",
