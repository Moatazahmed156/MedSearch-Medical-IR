    "abstract": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Most are related to disease activity and should be managed with appropriate medical therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. However, some patients may develop symptoms due to the side effects of the medications, or due to immunosuppression. In these cases, the offending medications should be discontinued until resolution of the symptoms and a few may be able to restart therapy. Symptoms can also occur as an extraintestinal manifestation of the disease or due to concomitant autoimmune-mediated disorders. Regardless of the etiology, symptoms should be addressed promptly with immediate evaluation and appropriate therapy, as a delay may lead to permanent sequela.",
