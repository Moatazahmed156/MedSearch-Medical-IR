    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome is a leading cause of mental retardation worldwide, with an incidence of approximately one case in 2000 live births. It is amongst the most common of human genetic diseases, and was the first to be associated with an unstable trinucleotide (CGG) repeat sequence. It is also characterized by a chromosomal fragile site which was the first of (now) four such sites to be identified at the molecular level. Each shows very similar features suggesting that other representatives of this type of fragile site will likely involve similar sequences. As with the other unstable trinucleotide repeats, the sequence at the fragile X locus is found to be remarkably unstable upon genetic transmission, however many features differ from the other repeats. As repeat expansion at the fragile X locus results in loss of expression of the co-resident FMR1 gene, the basis for clinical features is best understood in this disorder. Two additional fragile sites in the vicinity have been identified, and at least one of these is associated with mental retardation.",
