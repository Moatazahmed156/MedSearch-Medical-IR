    "abstract": "Thymic neoplasms are often treated with radiation and anthracyclines. Data on cardiovascular events remain limited. To assess the incidence and predictors of long-term cardiovascular events in patients with thymic neoplasms. This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients diagnosed with thymic neoplasms between 2004-2021. The primary outcome was a composite of the first myocardial infarction, obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) without infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, pacemaker implantation, or cardiovascular death. Cancer therapy was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Competing risk models and multivariable extended Cox regression were used. Amongst 410 patients (median age 57 years; 50% women) followed for a maximum of 19 years (median 6.9 years), the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 11.3% (95% CI 8.6-15.0%), 19.5% (15.4-24.6%), and 28.0% (22.6-34.8%) at 5, 10, and 14 years of follow-up respectively. Amongst the 84 patients with events, some experienced multiple events: heart failure (n=39), myocardial infarction (n=20), atrial fibrillation (n=25), stroke (n=18), obstructive CAD without infarction (n=6), pacemaker implantation (n=6), and cardiovascular death (n=6). Radiation alone (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.9, p=0.003), anthracyclines alone (HR 4.6, 95% CI 1.1-18.8, p=0.03), and both therapies combined (HR 12.2, 95% CI 4.5-32.7, p<0.001) were independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Baseline cardiovascular comorbidities also increased risk (HR 2.8; 95% CI 1.3-6.2). During follow-up, 94 patients (22.9%) died, most commonly from recurrent or progressive cancer (56.4%). Cardiovascular events are frequent among patients with thymic neoplasms, particularly those treated with radiation and anthracyclines. However, cancer-related mortality remained the predominant cause of death. Long-term cardiovascular surveillance and risk mitigation strategies should be considered.",
