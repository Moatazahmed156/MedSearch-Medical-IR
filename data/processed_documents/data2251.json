    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. The \"amyloid hypothesis\" is one of the predominant hypotheses for the pathogenesis of AD. Besides, tau protein accumulation, calcium homeostasis disruption, and glial cell activation are also remarkable features in AD. Recently, there are some reports showing that TRPC channels may function in AD development, especially TRPC6. In this chapter, we will discuss the evidence for the involvement of TRPC channels in Alzheimer's disease and the potential of therapeutics for AD based on TRPC channels.",
