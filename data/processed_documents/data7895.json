    "abstract": "The global prevalence of kidney diseases continues to rise annually, posing a serious public health challenge, and notably contributing to morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. In affected individuals, kidney function progressively declines, ultimately resulting in renal failure. Therefore, elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying kidney diseases and identifying novel therapeutic targets is of paramount importance. Among these, the regulation of cell death pathways has emerged as a pivotal factor in disease progression. PANoptosis, a recently characterized form of programmed cell death, is activated by diverse stimuli, and involves the integrated activation of pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis, coordinated through the PANoptosome complex. Increasing evidence has suggested that PANoptosis serves an important role in the development of kidney diseases, and further investigation into its regulatory mechanisms may provide valuable insights into disease modulation. The present review summarizes current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of PANoptosis and its involvement in various kidney diseases, offering perspectives for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
