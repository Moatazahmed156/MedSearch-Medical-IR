    "abstract": "In this column the author presents his thoughts on quality improvement (QI) as it relates to health care. Although the story of QI, combined with a drastic urgency for change, may have created the current state in its misapplication in health care, it is the QI tenets put forth by Deming that can redeem its promise. In this way, QI is a fractal, similar in makeup and application on various scales. This speaks to the universality of Deming's four tenets; the same tenets used for a successful QI project need to be employed in building the QI capacity of an organization (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",
