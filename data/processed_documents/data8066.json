    "abstract": "Sex specific differences exist in the impact of risk factors for the development of heart failure (HF). Addressing these differences can have an impact on prevention of HF. This article reviews sex-specific risk factors associated with development of HF. These risk factors include current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Other risks for HF are toxins, inflammation, and other chronic conditions, such as sleep breathing disorders, anemia, obesity, and renal insufficiency. Some of these risks factors present risk reduction opportunities that may improve outcomes.",
