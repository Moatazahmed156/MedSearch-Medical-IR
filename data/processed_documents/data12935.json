    "title": "First Sustainable One-Pot Tandem Hantzsch Multicomponent Reaction/Click Reaction Approach for Novel Multitarget-Directed Ligands in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "This study explores novel multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) showing anticholinesterase, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and calcium channel inhibitory activities, as promising compounds for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. The rational design combined dihydropyridines (DHPs), known for calcium channel blocking and neuroprotective properties, with tacrine, a cholinesterase inhibitor. The key innovation of this work lies in the one-pot tandem Hantzsch multicomponent/click reaction used to synthesize new 18 DHPs ",
