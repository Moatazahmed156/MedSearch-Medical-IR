    "abstract": "Clinical information was collected from six pediatric patients. Molecular experiments were performed on transfected human embryonic kidney and Chinese hamster ovary cells to study the effect of these variants on mitochondrial and lysosomal function. RT-qPCR, Western blot, apoptosis assay, mitochondrial and lysosomal tracker fluorescence intensity, and mitochondrial calcium concentration tests were performed. Additionally, we examined the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and mitochondrial enzymes and copy numbers. We identified six variants that downregulated  [Image: see text] The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00655-w.",
