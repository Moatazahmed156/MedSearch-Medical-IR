    "title": "Effect of nurse-led interventions on dyspnea severity and psychological well-being among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
    "abstract": "The impact of nurse-led interventions on dyspnoea and psychological well-being in COPD patients is of interest. Hence, 60 stable COPD patients were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received a comprehensive intervention, including breathing exercises, physical activity, dietary counselling, and psychological support, leading to significant improvements in dyspnoea and psychological well-being. In contrast, the control group showed no significant changes. Thus, we show the value of non-pharmacological nurse-led interventions in managing COPD and improving patient outcomes.",
