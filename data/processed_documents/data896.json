    "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate composition and spatial distribution of tight junction complex proteins during early mouse neurulation. The analyses focused on the cranial neural tube, which gives rise to all head structures. Neurulation brings about significant changes in the neuronal and non-neuronal ectoderm at a cellular and tissue level. During this process, precise coordination of both epithelial integrity and epithelial dynamics is essential for accurate tissue morphogenesis. Tight junctions are pivotal for epithelial integrity, yet their complex composition in this context remains poorly understood. Our examination of various tight junction proteins in the forebrain region of mouse embryos revealed distinct patterns in the neuronal and non-neuronal ectoderm, as well as mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cells. While claudin-4 exhibited exclusive expression in the non-neuronal ectoderm, we demonstrated a neuronal ectoderm specific localization for claudin-12 in the developing cranial neural tube. Claudin-5 was uniquely present in mesenchymal cells. Regarding the subcellular localization, canonical tight junction localization in the apical junctions was predominant for most tight junction complex proteins. ZO-1 (zona occludens protein-1), claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-12, and occludin were detected at the apical junction. However, claudin-1 and occludin also appeared in basolateral domains. Intriguingly, claudin-3 displayed a non-canonical localization, overlapping with a nuclear lamina marker. These findings highlight the diverse tissue and subcellular distribution of tight junction proteins and emphasize the need for their precise regulation during the dynamic processes of forebrain development. The study can thereby contribute to a better understanding of the role of tight junction complex proteins in forebrain development.",
