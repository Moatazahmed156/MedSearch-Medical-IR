    "abstract": "American author Thomas Wolfe's second novel, Time and the River, is a fictionalized autobiography. One interpretation of its title is that it refers to life being swept along as part of the inevitable passage of time. Publications, such as a periodical, may be considered from this same perspective. Ideas begin to germinate in the mind of an author(s) and efforts are undertaken to produce a manuscript that may prove worthy of acceptance as a publication. The process from submission of an article to its subsequent appearance either online or in printed form involves a sweep of events over an extended period of time.",
