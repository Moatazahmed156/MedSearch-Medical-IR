    "title": "Revolutionizing antiviral therapy: harnessing nanotechnology to unlock the power of phytoconstituents.",
    "abstract": "Viral diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused due to coronaviruses (CoVs), Ebola, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are still some of the major global causes of morbidity and mortality. Traditional antiviral therapies face limitations because of resistance development and toxicity. As a result, plant-derived medicines are gaining more attention for their therapeutic potential, owing to their lower toxicity and reduced likelihood of resistance development. This review critically examines the antiviral properties of phytoconstituents like coumarins, steroids, and polysaccharides against various viruses. It discusses their integration with nanotechnology delivery systems to overcome bioavailability issues and highlights the need for translational studies to corroborate in vitro results. The convergence of phytotherapy and nanotechnology represents a promising frontier in antiviral drug development. While significant progress has been made in identifying active phytochemicals and formulating them with nanocarriers, more ",
