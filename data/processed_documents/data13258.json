    "title": "Vestibular exercise for adjunctive therapy in the management of non-motor functions among Parkinson's patients: A review.",
    "abstract": "Non motor symptoms in Parkinson disease are present in about 88% of patients and they include different symptoms like insomnia, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive decline etc. The natures of neurodegenerative process and non-dopaminergic neuropathological changes are yet to be identified. Vestibular and visual deficit are non-studied symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises are known to improve the function and coordination of the vestibular system, thereby enhancing balance, reducing dizziness and improving spatial awareness. Additionally, vestibulospinal reflex exercises offer better static and dynamic firmness and functional symmetry in daily life situations. Thus, we show the evidence map for management of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease through vestibular stimulation.",
