    "abstract": "Molecular diagnostic techniques provide an unsurpassed opportunity to understand the pathophysiological basis of endocrine disorders. Diseases have been associated with mutations in almost every gene known to have a role in either the production or secretion of a hormone or the mediators of hormone signalling. Even though most of these mutations are rare and account for only a small fraction of endocrine diseases, molecular diagnostics offers a valuable tool for the clinician in these cases. The most common endocrine disorders such as autoimmune thyroiditis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, growth disorders, and obesity have all major genetic components, but these are mostly unknown. In this review the clinical implications of molecular diagnostics are illustrated for some endocrine diseases: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, congenital hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone resistance, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, growth hormone deficiency and resistance, and monogenic obesity. Improved diagnostic specificity has direct implications for treatment and follow up in these syndromes. Molecular diagnostics in endocrine tumours and diabetes are presented in two other articles in this series.",
