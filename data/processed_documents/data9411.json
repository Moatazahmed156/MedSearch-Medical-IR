    "title": "Beyond Diabetes: The Vasculoprotective Effects and Anti-Atherosclerotic Potential of Tirzepatide.",
    "abstract": "Tirzepatide is a long-acting agonist for the glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, weight management in obese patients, or overweight patients with at least one weight-related comorbid condition. The clinical effects of tirzepatide are demonstrated by improved glycemic control, reduced overall appetite, decreased food intake, and body weight. Several studies indicated that the vasculoprotective effects and anti-atherosclerotic potential of tirzepatide extend far beyond glycemic control. Tirzepatide stimulates the mobilization and function of endothelial progenitor cells, which facilitates vascular repair and mitigates hyperglycemia-induced damage. Tirzepatide enhances the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, reduces the activity of endothelial activation molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, promotes vasodilation, and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. Furthermore, the drug inhibits inflammation by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. Moreover, tirzepatide improves lipid profiles by decreasing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. By improving endothelial function, reducing inflammation, and lowering body weight, tirzepatide lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This article summarizes the data with special emphasis on the mechanisms underlying the anti-atherosclerotic and vasoprotective effects of tirzepatide, based on studies conducted to date.",
