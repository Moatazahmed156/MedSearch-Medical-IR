    "abstract": "Head and neck cancer includes tumours of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, sinonasal region, salivary glands, and thyroid. The majority are squamous cell carcinomas. The incidence is rising, primarily due to an increase in HPV-related cancers. HPV-positive tumours have a better prognosis than those caused by smoking and alcohol. Treatment includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with increasing use of minimally invasive techniques. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation are crucial. Prevention focuses on smoking cessation, reduced alcohol consumption, and HPV vaccination.",
