    "title": "Modeling Mammary Gland Development and Reproductive Cycles With Organoids.",
    "abstract": "Mammary organoids bridge the gap between reductionist 2D systems and in vivo models by recapitulating bilayered epithelial architecture, branching, hormone responsiveness, and, in advanced platforms, functional readouts of lactation. This review synthesizes organoid models across the reproductive cycle, including branching morphogenesis, pregnancy-induced alveologenesis and milk secretion, and involution; it also surveys emerging directions, including embryonic/pluripotent and cross-species systems, as well as co-culture and organ-on-chip platforms that incorporate stromal, adipose, and immune elements. We outline priorities for building more complex, physiologically faithful ex vivo models that will enable mechanistic dissection of mammary development, yield comparative and translational insights, and create scalable platforms for perturbation and screening, advancing lactation research, breast cancer studies, and women's health in general.",
