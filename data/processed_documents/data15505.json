    "abstract": "In 2024, an estimated 10 million people developed Tuberculosis (TB), nearly half a million of whom were infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Early detection of infection and drug resistance enables rapid engagement in effective care. Bacterial culture and nucleic acid testing remain the primary diagnostic methods, with smear microscopy being phased out. However, these methods present significant limitations for diagnosing drug resistance, such as lengthy time-to-result for phenotypic tests, as well as the need for prior knowledge of resistance mutations and prohibitive cost for molecular tests. To address this, we developed a rapid phenotypic TB drug susceptibility test, termed Tre-DST, based on novel metabolically incorporated trehalose probes, which specifically detect live mycobacteria. We used the nonpathogenic ",
