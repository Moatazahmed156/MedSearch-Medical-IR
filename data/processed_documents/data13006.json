    "abstract": "The contribution of cerebrovascular hemodynamic disturbances to Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Using time-shift analysis of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, we explored associations between cerebral blood transit time, amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, and cognition. We included 131 non-demented individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Three transit metrics - termed Lag At baseline, prolonged Lag Prolonged blood transit time can reflect early vascular impairment in AD. Vascular risks are associated with prolonged arterial transit time (Lag",
