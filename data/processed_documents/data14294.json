    "title": "Drug Delivery Systems Targeting the Knee Microenvironment: A Prospective Strategy for Knee Osteoarthritis Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a degenerative condition of the joints marked by the gradual deterioration of cartilage, inflammation, and pain, impacting millions globally. Treatment approaches for KOA encompass both surgical and non-surgical methods aimed at alleviating symptoms and enhancing functionality rather than providing a cure. Recent research into the mechanisms of osteoarthritis (OA) has highlighted the significance of the knee joint's microenvironment in the success of drug delivery, particularly with intra-articular therapies. A notable approach involves intra-articular (IA) injections, which allow for the targeted administration of medications directly into the joint area. Nevertheless, traditional treatments often fall short in effectiveness due to the limited bioavailability of drugs within the joint, quick clearance rates, and potential systemic side effects. Consequently, innovative drug delivery systems (DDS) that focus on the knee joint's microenvironment have emerged as a viable method to enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, drug delivery systems utilizing nanotechnology have shown advantages such as precise targeting, minimized systemic toxicity, and extended therapeutic effects in treating diseases. Gaining insight into these interactions is crucial for developing optimized drug delivery systems that can improve treatment results for individuals with knee disorders. This article examines the latest developments in nanotechnology-based therapies for KOA and explores future directions for enhancing and refining treatment strategies for this condition.",
