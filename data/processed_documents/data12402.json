    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatments, but the majority of cancer patients would inevitably develop resistance to immunotherapy. Th17 cells play complex but crucial roles in anti-cancer immune response, although their therapeutic potential remains underutilized. Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) function as prototypical commensal bacteria that can induce intestinal Th17 cells and impact host immune response. In this study, we investigated how SFB antigen-mediated immune responses modify the tumor microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor efficacy through a coordinated gut-lung immunological axis. We engineered B16F1 melanoma cells to express either the SFB3340 epitope (B16-3340, an I-A",
