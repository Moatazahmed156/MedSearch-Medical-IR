    "title": "Evaluating the impact of polypropylene-based cat litter on urinalysis reliability in feline patients.",
    "abstract": "Urinalysis is a key diagnostic tool in veterinary medicine, aiding in the detection of urinary diseases and systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. This study investigates the impact of polypropylene-based urine collection litter on the reliability of urinalysis results in feline patients. Urine samples were collected from 50 cats and divided into native and litter-treated aliquots. Parameters such as leukocytes, ketones, glucose, protein and pH were analyzed using dipsticks, refractometry and sediment examination. Significant differences were observed in leukocyte counts, which decreased after exposure to litter (p=0.0054), and inconsistencies were noted in ketone and glucose results. While protein, pH and red blood cell counts remained unaffected, sediment analysis revealed more contaminated backgrounds in litter-treated samples. These findings highlight that while urine collection litter is a practical solution for sample acquisition, it may introduce variability in certain parameters. Therefore, it is best suited for preliminary assessments and should guide further diagnostics rather than serve as a definitive basis for treatment or prognosis. Further research is needed to refine its application in clinical settings.",
