    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed tumorous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the barriers to mammography adoption among Iranian women.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study is a qualitative component of a large research project on exploratory sequential mixed method design, utilizing conventional content analysis. In total, 24 participants were selected from among women who had participated in the first phase of the study. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Five main themes were extracted, consisting of unawareness of mammography, fear control, priority of mammography needs, inadequate competency of mammography centers, and a sense of losing family support.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Different perceived barriers within various levels (individual, intrapersonal, health systems, and community) play influential roles in women's decisions to participate in breast cancer screening program, which indicates the cultural aspect of perceived barriers in different communities and countries.
