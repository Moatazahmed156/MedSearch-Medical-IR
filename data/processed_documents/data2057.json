    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world. The five-year survival rate is 19.7%, which seriously threatens human health. Lung cancer screening is an effective measure to reduce lung cancer mortality. Existing studies have shown that screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20%. Currently, lung cancer screening is recommended internationally and nationally. Studying the development status of lung cancer screening helps us to identify the high-risk groups of lung cancer, explore reasonable screening programs, improve the cost-effectiveness of screening and reduce the economic burden. Therefore, this article summarizes the current status of lung cancer screening, the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening and the existing problems as follows. .",
