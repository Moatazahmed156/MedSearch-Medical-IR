    "abstract": "Chemotherapy is one of the widely used anticancer treatments that involves the use of powerful cytotoxic drugs to stop tumor growth by targeting rapidly dividing cells through various mechanisms, which will be elucidated in this review. Introduced during the early twentieth century, chemotherapy has since lengthened the longevity of innumerable cancer patients. However, the increase in lifespan is at the expense of quality of life as patients are at risk of developing short-term and long-term side effects following chemotherapy, such as alopecia (hair loss), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cardiotoxicity, diarrhea, infertility, and chemo brain. Currently, a number of these chemotherapy-induced adverse effects are managed through supportive care and approved treatments, while the rest of the side effects are unavoidable. Hence, chemotherapeutic drugs associated with inevitable side effects are only administered when their therapeutic role outweighs their chemotoxicity, thus severely limiting the potency of chemotherapy in treating malignancy. Therein, the potential approaches to alleviating side effects of chemotherapy ranging from pharmaceutical drugs to alternative therapies will be discussed in this review in hopes of increasing the tolerance and effectiveness of future chemotherapeutic treatments.",
