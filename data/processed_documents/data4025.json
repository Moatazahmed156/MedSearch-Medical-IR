    "summary": "A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology and endocrine pediatric societies now proposes changing the name of \"diabetes insipidus\" to \"Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D)\" for central etiologies, and \"Arginine Vasopressin R …",
    "abstract": "\"What's in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet\" (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare). Shakespeare's implication is that a name is nothing but a word and it therefore represents a convention with no intrinsic meaning. Whilst this may be relevant to romantic literature, disease names do have real meanings, and consequences, in medicine. Hence, there must be a very good rational for changing the name of a disease that has a centuries-old historical context. A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology and endocrine pediatric societies now proposes changing the name of \"diabetes insipidus\" to \"Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D)\" for central etiologies, and \"Arginine Vasopressin Resistance (AVP-R)\" for nephrogenic etiologies This editorial provides both the historical context and the rational for this proposed name change.",
