    "abstract": "In order to understand the heavy metal contamination of soil and vegetables in the vegetable production system of Zhejiang Province and the health risks of vegetables consumed by residents, typical vegetable production bases in Zhejiang Province were selected as the study areas; 102 pairs of vegetable and soil samples were collected; the distribution characteristics of heavy metals Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, As, Ni, and Hg in the vegetable production system of Zhejiang Province were analyzed, and the ecological health risks of the vegetable production system were systematically evaluated using the Nemerow composite pollution index, potential ecological risk index, and dietary exposure assessment model. The results showed that Cd in the soil seriously exceeded the standard, with an exceedance rate of 97.2%. The main risk of soil pollution was moderate and mild, and the highest risk was Cd, followed by Pb, Cu, and As. Among vegetables, only a small amount of bean and fruit vegetables exceeded the Cd content, with the exceedance rates of 12.5% and 8.7%, respectively. The BCF of different types of vegetables differed significantly and could be ranked accordingly:leafy vegetables>bean vegetables>melon vegetables>root vegetables. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Zhejiang residents consuming local vegetables were within acceptable limits, with children being more at risk than adults (P<0.01), and Cd and Pb contributing the most to health risks. The overall vegetables produced by the vegetable production system in Zhejiang Province were at a safe level, but there is a need to strengthen the control of Cd and Pb pollution sources.",
