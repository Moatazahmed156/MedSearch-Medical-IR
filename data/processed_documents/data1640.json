    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      After the elimination of leprosy in 1995, there were 10-30 newly detected leprosy cases every year in Zhejiang Province, and the epidemiological characteristics of the newly detected leprosy cases have changed. While most of the newly detected cases came from other provinces in China, not Zhejiang, it brought a new challenge for leprosy prevention and control in post- elimination era in Zhejiang, China. This study was aimed to understand the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics of newly detected leprosy cases, and provide the scientific rationales for the development of leprosy control strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data on the demographic of Zhejiang Province from 2011 to 2019 were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, and the epidemiological data on leprosy cases newly detected in Zhejiang Province from 2011 to 2019 were obtained from the LEPROSY MANAGEMANT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN CHINA (LEPMIS), and temporal-spatial distributions were described. The geographic information system software-ArcGIS 10.4 was used to draw the statistical maps, and Geoda 1.14.0 was used for local spatial autocorrelation analysis (local Getis coefficient method). Ridley-Jopling classification was used to classify the clinical types into I, TT, BT, BB, BL or LL. Two-group classification system developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used and cases were classified into multibacillary (MB) type or paucibacillary (PB) type.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 167 leprosy cases were reported in Zhejiang Province during 2011-2019, including 107 cases in males and 60 in females. The mean age at diagnosis was 37.99±14.81 years, and 94.01% of the cases were detected through the examination at skin-clinics. The number of workers, MB cases, G2D cases were 81 (48.50%), 159 (94.01%), 24 (14.37%) respectively, and the rate of early detection increased from 45.16% in 2011 to 90.91% in 2019. Leprosy cases were reported in all the prefectures of Zhejiang except Zhoushan City. The cases in local population accounted for 23.35% (39 cases), and the cases in floating population (especially coming from high epidemic provinces in China) accounted for 76.65% (128 cases). The annual number of newly detected cases showed a decreasing trend, from 31 cases in 2011 to 11 in 2019. Time of the floating population living in Zhejiang Province ranged from several months to more than 10 years. The annual proportion of new cases with G2D declined from 22.58% in 2011 to 9.09% in 2019. The results of local indicators of autocorrelation (LISA) analysis showed that the high-high areas were mainly concentrated in the middle and northeast of Zhejiang Province, while the low-low areas were in the east and southwest.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A few scattered cases still can be seen in post-elimination era, and there was a spatial clustering of the newly detected leprosy cases in Zhejiang Province. Most of the cases in Zhejiang Province were from other high epidemic provinces in China, which brought a new challenge for leprosy control and prevention in post- elimination era in Zhejiang, and it is also necessary to strengthen the early detection and standard management of the leprosy cases in floating population in Zhejiang.",
