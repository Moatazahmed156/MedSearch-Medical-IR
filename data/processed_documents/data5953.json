    "abstract": "Anti-gastric activity of metoclopramide was studied in guinea pigs using three different models of gastric ulceration. The effect of metoclopramide on gastric acidity was also studied. It was observed that metoclopramide affords protection against all types of experimentally induced gastric ulceration, without affecting the gastric acid secretion. The protective effect, therefore, is probably due to its ability to promote gastric drainage and to prevent the pyloric reflux, thus preventing corrosive effects of bile and acid on the stomach mucosa.",
