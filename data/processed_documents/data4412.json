    "abstract": "Diabetic wounds, a prevalent and severe complication of diabetes, pose a significant burden on the global healthcare system. This burden arises from their high incidence, high disability rates, and substantial treatment costs. Research has shown that excessive oxidative stress damage plays a crucial role in diabetic wounds. This oxidative stress not only complicates the healing process but also triggers various forms of programmed cell death, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis. These programmed cell deaths significantly hinder wound recovery. In this narrative review, we comprehensively review the impact of oxidative stress on diabetic wounds and its intricate interplay with programmed cell death. With ongoing intensive research into oxidative stress in diabetic wounds, we are confident that innovative therapies will emerge in the near future.",
