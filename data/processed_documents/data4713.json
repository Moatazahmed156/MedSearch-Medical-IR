    "abstract": "In recent years, rapid advances in research methods have made single cell analysis possible. Systemic sclerosis (SSc), a disease characterized by the triad of immune abnormalities, fibrosis, and vasculopathy, has also been the subject of various analyses. To summarize the results of single cell analysis in SSc accumulated to date and to deepen our understanding of SSc. Four databases were used to perform a database search on 23rd June 2023. Assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence were performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The analysis was completed on July 2023. 17 studies with 358 SSc patients were included. Three studies used PBMCs, six used skin, nine used lung with SSc-interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), and one used lung with SSc-pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The cells studied included immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, alveolar type I cells, basal epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mesothelial cells, etc. This systematic review revealed the results of single cell analysis, suggesting that PBMCs, skin, SSc-ILD, and SSc-PAH show activation and dysfunction of cells associated with immune-abnormalities, fibrosis, and vasculopathy, respectively.",
