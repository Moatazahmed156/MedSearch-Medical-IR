    "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      To compare prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels with bacterial growth in prostate tissue cultures.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifty male patients who underwent transurethral prostate resection were investigated prospectively. Resection chips from the prostate gland were added to brain-heart infusion medium and incubated. PSA levels were determined preoperatively at our urology ward. The prostate gland volume was estimated by transabdominal ultrasound examination preoperatively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Persons with positive bacterial prostate tissue cultures have a greater prostate volume. This is significant in patients with and without histopathologic signs of prostatitis. Persons with positive bacterial prostate tissue cultures have higher PSA values. This is significant in patients without histopathologic signs of prostatitis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      People with positive bacterial prostatic tissue culture have a higher prostate volume in comparison with patients with negative culture findings and show a tendency toward increased PSA levels as well.",
