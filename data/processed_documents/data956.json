    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutation in the FMR1 gene, leading to the absence or reduced levels of fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP). This results in neurodevelopmental deficits, including autistic spectrum conditions. On the other hand, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a distinct disorder caused by the premutation in the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is associated with elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, leading to neurodegenerative manifestations such as tremors and ataxia.Mounting evidence suggests a link between both syndromes and mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF). In this minireview, we critically examine the intricate relationship between FXS, FXTAS, and MDF, focusing on potential therapeutic avenues to counteract or mitigate their adverse effects. Specifically, we explore the role of mitochondrial cofactors and antioxidants, with a particular emphasis on alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), carnitine (CARN) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Findings from this review will contribute to a deeper understanding of these disorders and foster novel therapeutic strategies to enhance patient outcomes.",
