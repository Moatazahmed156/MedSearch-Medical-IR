    "abstract": "BackgroundThis study aimed to identify people living with HIV (PLWH) with tuberculosis (TB) co-infection, explore their demographic and clinical characteristics, and determine predictors of early mortality within 6 months of TB diagnosis.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary referral center in Türkiye of PLWH diagnosed with TB between 2004 and 2023. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were reviewed, and statistical analyses were performed to identify early mortality predictors.ResultsAmong 1541 PLWH, 62 (4%) had TB, and 23 (37%) died within 6 months. TB presentations were pulmonary (44%), extrapulmonary (27%), and both (29%). Predictors significantly associated with early mortality included lymphopenia (",
