    "title": "Gut Microbiota-Targeted Photobiomodulation Ameliorates Alzheimer's Pathology via the Gut-Brain Axis: Comparable Efficacy to Transcranial Irradiation.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with limited effective and affordable therapies. Photobiomodulation (PBM) offers a safe, non-invasive treatment strategy, yet conventional transcranial PBM (tc-PBM) is restricted by low skull penetration. To overcome this limitation, gut microbiota-targeted PBM (gm-PBM) has been proposed to modulate the gut-brain axis, though its efficacy and mechanisms remain unclear. Here, six-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice received gm-PBM or tc-PBM (810 nm, 25 mW/cm",
