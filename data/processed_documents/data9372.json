    "title": "Semaglutide-induced transient intestinal ischemia: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health issue that impacts millions of people worldwide. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was initially developed as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus under the brand name Ozempic. Additional studies showed semaglutide at larger doses (marketed as Wegovy) to be an effective medication for weight management. Wegovy for managing obesity is typically well tolerated; however, there have been reports of gastrointestinal adverse effects. Only 1 case of Wegovy-induced transient intestinal ischemia has been documented, making it extremely unusual. Here, we report the case of a 50-year-old man who experienced transient intestinal ischemia following his first Wegovy dosage.",
