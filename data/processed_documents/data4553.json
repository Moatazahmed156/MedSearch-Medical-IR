    "abstract": "Many human syndromes associated with hearing loss are caused by disease genes located on the X chromosome, but few X-linked loci for non-syndromic hearing loss have been reported. Surprisingly, a Y-linked locus has been identified, representing one of the only disease loci on the Y chromosome. This study reviews the different sex-linked genes and loci on the X- and Y chromosome leading to syndromic and especially non-syndromic hearing loss.",
