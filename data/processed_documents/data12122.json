    "title": "AutoPET Challenge on Fully Automated Lesion Segmentation in Oncologic PET/CT Imaging, Part 2: Domain Generalization.",
    "abstract": "This article reports the results of the second iteration of the autoPET challenge on automated lesion segmentation in whole-body PET/CT, held in conjunction with the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention in 2023. In contrast to the first autoPET challenge, which served as a proof of concept, this study investigates whether machine learning-based segmentation models trained on data from a single source can maintain performance across clinically relevant variations in PET/CT data, reflecting the demands of real-world deployment.
