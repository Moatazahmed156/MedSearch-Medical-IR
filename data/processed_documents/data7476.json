    "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Although men make up a small percentage of those diagnosed with breast cancer, they are usually diagnosed at a later stage than women, increasing their chance of mortality. The reasons for this gender disparity require additional study.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      This article examines current literature on male breast cancer, including reasons for the gender disparity and interventions that may help to address it.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An integrative review was conducted, and 12 studies were selected for inclusion.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Study consensus is that male breast cancer is an underresearched subject and that increased research efforts may improve outcomes.
