    "abstract": "The incidence, risk factors, and microbiological profile of surgical site infections (SSIs) in 142 patients undergoing major oncologic resections across gastrointestinal, breast, and head and neck malignancies is of interest. The overall SSI rate was 19.7%, with the highest incidence seen in gastrointestinal surgeries. Prolonged operative time, high ASA grade, and preoperative hypoalbuminemia were significant predictors of SSI. Most infections were caused by gram-negative organisms, with ",
