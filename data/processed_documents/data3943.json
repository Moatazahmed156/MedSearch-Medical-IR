    "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      To develop the algorithm of prognosis and prevention of climatic maladaptation in healthy young people with peculiarities of the autonomic nervous system (VNS) during off-season and treatment the identified disturbances with reflexotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      VNS functions were assessed in load conditions in 145 people in the beginning and in the end of a rest at the Black Sea coast. The Vein's questionnaire, active orthoclinostatic test (AOT), and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and ECG recording were used. Spielberger-Khanin test was administered to assess anxiety. Autonomic disorders caused by climatic maladaptation were treated with reflexotherapy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      AOT has shown VNS dysfunctions in 67.7% of subjects, HRV analysis in 54.3%, and the Vein questionnaire in 96.55%. There was no significant difference between the results of AOT and HRV analysis, while the Vein questionnaire results exceeded them both (Pearson χ2, p<0.05), being 1,4 times greater than the HRV analysis result. This higher percentage is explained by the high level of subjects' trait anxiety.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The practical value of the Vein questionnaire for the diagnosis, choice and assessment of treatment is confirmed.",
