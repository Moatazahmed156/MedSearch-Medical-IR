    "abstract": "The vasculature is increasingly recognized as an active regulator of homeostasis and repair, beyond conventional roles in nutrient delivery. In the central nervous system, vascular cells adopt region-specific traits tailored to the distinct demands of the brain, retina, and spinal cord. Despite long-standing interest in the spinal cord as a model for neural development and injury, its vascular organization and properties remain understudied. The assumption that spinal cord and brain neurovascular systems are built and function in the same way has limited progress. Here, we challenge this view by examining specific properties underlying spinal cord vascular development, physiology, and pathology. We highlight unique angioarchitecture and homeostatic mechanisms, and discuss how neurovascular disruption contributes to spinal disorders and regenerative failure after injury. Identifying critical knowledge gaps, we aim to stimulate new research in spinal cord neurovascular biology, redefining its importance for health and disease.",
