    "abstract": "Sepsis, as an important public health concern, is one of the leading causes of death in hospitals around the world, accounting for 25% of all deaths. Nowadays, several factors contribute to the development of sepsis. The role of the gut microbiota and the response state of the aberrant immune system is dominant. The effect of the human microbiome on health is undeniable, and gut microbiota is even considered a body organ. It is now clear that the alteration in the normal balance of the microbiota (dysbiosis) is associated with a change in the status of immune system responses. Owing to the strong association between the gut microbiota and its metabolites particularly short-chain fatty acids with many illnesses, the gut microbiota has a unique position in the research of microbiologists and even clinicians. This review aimed to analyze studies' results on the association between microbiota and sepsis, with a substantial understanding of their relationship. As a result, an extensive and comprehensive search was conducted on this issue in existing databases.",
