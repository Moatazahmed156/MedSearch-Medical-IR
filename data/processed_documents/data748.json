    "abstract": "Purpose of review:\n        \n      \n      Urbanization is a multifaceted process that can have both positive and negative effects on mental health, especially in adolescents. This paper attempts to summarize the impact of urbanization on youth mental health in Hong Kong.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      Several studies have shown that urbanization is associated with an increased risk of youth mental health problems in Hong Kong. Psychosocial factors like perceived stress, social isolation, and exposure to environmental pollutants may contribute to a negative association between urbanization and mental health issues. Academic pressure, poor transparency and accessibility to mental health services in Hong Kong further exacerbate youth's mental health wellbeing. Environmental factors like housing conditions, green spaces, and visible urban greenery have been found to influence mental health outcomes. Existing empirical studies have found a positive association between urbanization and mental health problems, while others have found no association or even a negative association.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Further research is warranted to investigate the complex relationship between urbanization and youth mental health in Hong Kong. Exploration of effective interventions is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on youth mental health. Understanding this relationship can inform health policy-making and formulate interventions to promote youth's mental health well being in the short-and long run.",
