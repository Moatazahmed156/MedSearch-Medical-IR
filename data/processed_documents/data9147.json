    "abstract": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of hemorrhagic stroke with significant morbidity and mortality, and it often leads to poor clinical outcome. Although great efforts have been made toward animal and clinical studies, optimal therapy of SAH remains a challenge for scientists and clinicians. Increasing evidence suggests that stem-cell-based therapies may provide innovative approaches for treatment of SAH-related disability. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in stem cell research in SAH. Neuroregeneration after SAH could be conducted by the activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs), transplantation of external stem cells, or reprogramming non-neuronal cell to neurons. The potential mechanism and signaling pathways, as well as the efficiency and safety of these stem cell treatments, were discussed in detail. Although lots of challenges remain for translating the laboratory findings and technologies into clinical therapies, these research studies provided the foundation and guidance for using different resources of stem cells as a brain repair strategy after SAH.",
