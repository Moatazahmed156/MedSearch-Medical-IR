    "abstract": "The early postnatal period represents a critical window of time for the establishment and maturation of the human gut microbiota. The gut microbiota undergoes dramatic developmental changes during the first year of life, being influenced by a variety of external factors, with diet being a major player. Indeed, the introduction of complementary feeding provides novel nutritive substrates and triggers a shift from milk-adapted gut microbiota toward an adult-like bacterial composition, which is characterized by an enhancement in diversity and proportions of fiber-degrading bacterial genera like Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Eubacterium, and Bacteroides genera. Inadequate gut microbiota development in early life is frequently associated with concomitant and future adverse health conditions. Thus, understanding the processes that govern initial colonization and establishment of microbes in the gastrointestinal tract is of great importance. This review summarizes the actual understanding of the assembly and development of the microbial community associated with the infant gut, emphasizing the importance of mother-to-infant vertical transmission events as a fundamental arrival route for the first colonizers.",
