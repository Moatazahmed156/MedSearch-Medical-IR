    "abstract": "Most type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin due to an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Type 1 diabetes can be classified into 3 types according to the onset pattern of hyperglycemia; i.e., acute onset, slowly progressive and fulminant type 1 diabetes, and the diagnostic criterion for each type of diabetes has been recently established. Intensive insulin therapy by multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is best for keeping blood sugar in tight control and recommended for most people with type 1 diabetes. In addition, carbohydrate counting is a recommended dietary strategy for achieving glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.",
