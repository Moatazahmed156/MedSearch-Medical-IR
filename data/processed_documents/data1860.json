    "abstract": "This article is a part of the \"Do you know your guidelines\" series by the Education Committee of the American Head and Neck Society. The aim is to summarize the core principles outlined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines In Oncology (NCCN Guidelines® ) on management of malnutrition in patients with head and neck cancer. We outline the current recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN® ) for the screening and management of malnutrition, including indications for nutritional supplementation and placement of a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. We also include a brief review of the available literature on additional screening tools, alternative guidelines, as well as an update on the emerging data surrounding the use of immune-enhancing nutrition.",
