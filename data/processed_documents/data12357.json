    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) persists as a leading contributor to global cancer-associated mortality. Identifying key oncogenic drivers is crucial for improving therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to investigate the role of TICRR in LUAD progression and its potential as a therapeutic target. Hub genes were screened through integration of DepMap CRISPR-Cas9 data, TCGA expression profiles, and survival analysis. TICRR expressions was assessed in LUAD tissues, adjacent controls, and cell lines by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Functional roles were examined using MTT, colony formation, transwell, wound healing, and EdU assays  TICRR expression was observed to be significantly elevated in LUAD tissues and cell lines, and its higher levels correlated with unfavorable patient outcomes and enrichment of malignant pathways, including EMT, E2F targets, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. High TICRR expression correlated with distinct somatic mutation patterns, increased tumor mutation burden, and elevated immune checkpoint expression.  TICRR functions as a critical oncogenic driver in LUAD, promoting proliferation, invasion, and immune evasion. Targeting TICRR may represent a novel strategy for personalized treatment of LUAD.",
