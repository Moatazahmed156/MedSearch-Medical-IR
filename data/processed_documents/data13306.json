    "title": "Compliance and Satisfaction for 16 months of Adapted Tango vs. Supervised Walking for People with Parkinson's.",
    "abstract": "The present study is an exploratory secondary analysis examining associations between Parkinson's disease (PD) characteristics and compliance and satisfaction with exercise programs as part of ongoing clinical trial research. 36 participants with PD engaged in either adapted tango (AT; n = 20) or supervised walking (WALK; n = 16) classes for 16 months. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04122690) on October 10, 2019. PD-related metrics, dyskinesia frequency and duration, OFF-time, freezing of gait (FOG), disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr stage, and motor and cognitive function were collected. Linear regression models assessed associations with attendance and satisfaction. Attendance varied widely (range: 1-76; mean ± SD: 39.1 ± 26.0 sessions), with overall satisfaction favorable (4.0 ± 0.8 on a 5-point scale). Dyskinesia metrics showed negative correlations with compliance: percentage of dyskinesia (β = -0.381, R",
