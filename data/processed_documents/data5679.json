    "abstract": "The gut microbiome contains trillions of commensal microorganisms that maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host, and its profound effects on gastrointestinal diseases have been widely described. Recently, gut microbiota have emerged as important factors in endocrine system diseases. Disruption of the gut microbiota affects neuroendocrine homeostasis and promotes peripheral endocrine system diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and hyperuricemia. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the biological mechanisms of gut microbiota that participate in endocrine system pathologies and discusses potential novel therapies for these diseases.",
