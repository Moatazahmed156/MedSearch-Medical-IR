As the strain on health care resources increases, the cost of these quality improvements is becoming increasingly important. The aims of this article are to review the available tools for assessing the cost of quality improvement along with the willingness to pay and to provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of innovations in terms of quality and economic metrics and provide examples from the neurosurgical literature.",
