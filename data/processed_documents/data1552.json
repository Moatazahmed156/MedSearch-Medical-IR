    "abstract": "Congestion is one of the most prominent characteristics of patients presented with decompensated heart failure and it implies unfavorable prognosis for the heart failure patient. Neurohumoral and immuno-inflammatory activation secondary to cardiac dysfunction constitute the pivotal mechanisms driving the heart failure syndrome that results in progressive fluid accumulation. In addition, fluid redistribution between different vascular compartments in human body guided from sympathetic activity constitutes another mechanism for heart failure decompensation. Ultrasound applied in the form of echocardiography provides invaluable data for the assessment of intracardiac filling pressures. The type of renal venous flow can provide the degree of renal congestion and probably insight into the pathophysiology of the decompensation of heart failure. Assessment of lung congestion in the patient with heart failure can be accomplished by lung ultrasonography. Additionally, clinical studies on the role of ultrasound in the management and prognosis of the congested patient are reviewed. Special heart failure population supported with left ventricular assist devices and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support constitute an area where ultrasound guidance of fluid management has gained important role.",
