    "abstract": "The efficacy of spinal injection for chronic spinal pain is dubious for most conditions. They are however frequently prescribed. Side effects are poorly reported in the literature. In addition to benign and transient problems, serious and lethal side effects have been reported due to infection, hematoma or central and spinal cord infarctions which could be related to intravascular injection of corticoids. Although their frequency is excessively low, they should be discussed with every patient before prescription and should be mentioned in the consent form.",
