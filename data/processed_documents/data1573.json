    "abstract": "Heart failure is a chronic condition that can result from multiple causes and occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Heart failure is often classified by ejection fraction (or 'heart squeeze'), into three categories: preserved, mildly reduced, or reduced ejection fraction. Diagnosing heart failure can be challenging. Common symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath may overlap with other conditions and can be missed by healthcare professionals. While heart failure can lead to serious health problems, it is a manageable condition through medical interventions that target the underlying causes along with nutrition and lifestyle approaches. Comprehensive care should also include addressing the impact of heart failure on mental health. Effective therapies can help patients with heart failure feel better, function better, stay out of hospital, and live longer. Working towards acceptance of a heart failure diagnosis and embracing self-care are key positive steps for improving quality of life. Effective healthcare professional-patient relationships are critical. Open communication allows healthcare providers, including specialist nurses and clinicians, along with primary healthcare professionals, to fully understand a patient's condition and recommend suitable treatment approaches. It may also motivate patients to adhere to therapies and adopt lifestyle changes. This review aims to empower patients with heart failure by providing clear information on diagnosis and treatment, as well as providing real-life patient perspectives that can support effective communication with healthcare providers.",
