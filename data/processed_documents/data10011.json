    "title": "Comprehensive Review on Febuxostat for Hyperuricemia with Gout: Insights from Current Practice and Clinical Trials.",
    "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder associated with an increased risk of gout, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The management of hyperuricemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred primarily relies on xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs), such as allopurinol and Febuxostat. Febuxostat, a non-purine selective XOI, has demonstrated superior urate-lowering efficacy, particularly in patients with renal impairment. This review provides an in-depth analysis of Febuxostat's pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and safety profile, with a focus on cardiovascular and nephroprotective effects.",
