    "title": "Epileptic spasm recognition: EEG classification using time-frequency features and machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Epileptic spasm (ES), characterized by sudden muscle contractions and loss of consciousness, poses significant challenges in early diagnosis and treatment, especially in infants and young children. Despite advances in EEG-based seizure detection, the automatic classification of ES remains a complex task due to the variability of seizure patterns. In this study, we propose an approach for classifying ES EEG based on clinically collected data, using time-frequency domain features derived from EEG signals and machine learning models. A total of 54 time-frequency features were extracted, and three machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-were employed to classify the seizures. The results show that the RF model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 81.18% when fewer features were used, whereas KNN has increased performances with larger feature sets. This work highlights the potential of combining time-frequency features with machine learning for accurate seizure classification, offering a promising tool for automated monitoring and diagnosis of ES. Further research is needed to refine feature extraction methods and improve model robustness for clinical applications.",
