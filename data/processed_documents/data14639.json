    "title": "Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury in south India: Clinical profile and maternal outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (PR-AKI) is an uncommon but serious complication that poses significant maternal and foetal risks. This retrospective study analysed 83 cases of PR-AKI to evaluate causes, clinical features, and outcomes. Overall, 71% recovered, 23% developed chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 6% died. Thrombotic microangiopathy carried the highest CKD risk (85%), while sepsis caused most deaths (27%). Patients who could be managed conservatively recovered fully, whereas those more severe illness requiring dialysis inevitably had less favourable outcomes. Early recognition of high-risk conditions and timely intervention can therefore improve renal recovery and maternal survival.",
