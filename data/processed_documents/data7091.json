    "abstract": "Low back pain is a common symptom in the older person. Whilst the majority of cases are thought to be mechanical or idiopathic and benign in nature, its multiple potential causes and concerns regarding missed diagnosis of less common but more serious underlying pathological diagnoses mean many physicians find the assessment, investigation and treatment of chronic low back pain in older adults challenging. This narrative review describes the classification of low back pain in older adults, discusses both mechanical and sinister causes of pain, highlights the appropriate use of medical imaging and provides an overview of surgical and non-surgical management of these patients.",
