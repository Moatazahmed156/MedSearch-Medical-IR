    "abstract": "Nutrition plays a vital role in wound healing, influencing both the speed and quality of recovery. The wound healing process encompasses haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling, each reliant on specific nutrients. This article summarises the current literature on the role of nutrition in wound healing, focusing on key nutrients: proteins, vitamins (A, C, E, K), and minerals (zinc, iron, copper, manganese), essential for collagen synthesis, immune function, and cellular activity. Nurses are pivotal in assessing nutritional status, implementing dietary interventions, and educating patients and caregivers about the importance of nutrition in wound care. Practical strategies include personalised dietary plans, appropriate use of nutritional supplements, and regular monitoring of nutritional intake and wound healing progress. Although the benefits of nutrition in wound healing are well established, challenges persist, particularly in the limited evidence beyond pressure injuries and the constrained efficacy of supplementation without deficiencies. A multidisciplinary approach is critical to optimise nutritional support and improve patient outcomes in wound healing.",
