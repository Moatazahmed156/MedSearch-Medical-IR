    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation training measures under the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model on rehabilitation training compliance and knee function of patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A randomized controlled trial was performed. A total of 90 patients who underwent TKA at our hospital between June 2022 and June 2023 were randomly assigned to either a control group ( A significant Group × Time interaction  Rehabilitation training interventions based on the IMB model can significantly enhance patients' compliance with postoperative rehabilitation exercises and effectively improve knee joint function, reduce pain intensity, and enhance exercise tolerance, demonstrating the practical utility and value of the IMB model in promoting functional recovery after TKA.",
