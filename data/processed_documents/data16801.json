    "title": "Causal influences of migraine on neuropsychiatric disorders: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study.",
    "abstract": "Our study aims to explore the causal relationship between migraine (with and without aura) and 6 disorders: anxiety, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, major depressive disorder, insomnia, and stroke, using a 2-sample Mendelian randomization. Migraine without aura had a significant causal association with bipolar disorder (odds ratios = 1.075, 95% confidence intervals = [1.005-1.151], P = .037). A complex relationship was found with major depressive disorder (odds ratios = 1.036, 95% confidence intervals = [1.009-1.064], P = .010 for overall migraine). But after correction for Benjamini-Hochberg multiple tests, no causal links were identified between migraine (with and without aura) and these 6 disorders (all PFDR > .05). Further biological and clinical studies are needed to validate these findings.",
