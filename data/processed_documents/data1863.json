    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a key component in the treatment of many head and neck cancers, and its potential to cause long-term adverse effects has become increasingly recognized. In this review, we describe the short-term and long-term sequelae of radiation-associated changes in and injury to the temporal bone and its related structures. The pathophysiology of radiation-induced injury and its clinical entities, including sensorineural hearing loss, chronic otitis media, osteoradionecrosis, and radiation-associated malignancies, are described. We also discuss radiation dose to the head and neck as it relates to these conditions. An improved understanding of radiation's effects on the temporal bone will enable physicians and researchers to continue efforts to reduce radiotherapy-related sequelae and guide clinicians in diagnosing and treating the various otologic conditions that can arise in patients with head and neck cancer who have received radiotherapy. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
