    "abstract": "A series of platinum(II) complexes bearing 9,9-diaryl-4,5-diazafluorene bidentate ligands (N-N) has been synthesized, and their structural and antiproliferative properties were evaluated. The aryl substituents on the diazafluorene core feature representative variations in electronic and steric properties. Two families of complexes were prepared: type a [PtCl",
