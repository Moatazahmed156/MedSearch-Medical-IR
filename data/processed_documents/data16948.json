    "abstract": "Mutations in the DDX3X gene are the primary cause of DDX3X syndrome, with over 800 diagnosed families worldwide. DDX3X is also recognized as a single-gene driver for rare syndromes associated with epilepsy, autism, and developmental disorders. Clinical studies suggest potential links between DDX3X mutations and various cardiac comorbidities. However, there is no report on whether Ddx3xa knockout leads to cardiac phenotypes or whether a zebrafish  A  Homozygous knockout ( This study provides the first evidence that ",
