    "abstract": "We examined the role of spinally located β-adrenergic receptors in the regulation of the blood glucose level. The intrathecal (i.t.) injections with dobutamine (β1-adrenergic receptor agonist) or terbutaline (β2-adrenergic receptor agonist) caused an elevation of the blood glucose level, whereas metoprolol (β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or butoxamine (β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) did not. In addition, i.t. pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) attenuated the hyperglycemic effect induced by dobutamine or terbutaline. Moreover, plasma insulin level was increased by dobutamine but not by terbutaline, and PTX reduced dobutamine-induced up-regulation of the plasma insulin level. Terbutaline significantly increased plasma corticosterone level, and PTX further enhanced terbutaline-induced corticosterone level. Furthermore, intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with hexamethonium- (a preganglionic blocker) attenuated dobutamine- and terbutaline-induced hyperglycemic effects. Our results suggest that activation of spinal β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors produces hyperglycemic effects in a different manner. Spinally located PTX-sensitive G-proteins appear to be involved in hyperglycemic effect induced by terbutaline. Furthermore, dobutamine- or terbutaline-induced hyperglycemia appears to be mediated through the spinal nerves.",
