    "abstract": "Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but current EGFR mutation profiling relies on invasive tumor biopsies. Developing less invasive approaches, particularly proteomic evaluation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for EGFR mutation profiling, remains crucial. A flow cytometry method for detecting EGFR The gating strategy was defined by CD45 This study introduces a feasible, less invasive proteomic approach for binarily detecting EGFR mutations in CTCs, offering a novel means for patient identification.",
