    "abstract": "Recent progress about a novel organic-inorganic hybrid materials, namely cyclodextrins (CDs) modified/coated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is summarized by using a special categorization method focusing on the interactions between CDs and MOFs moieties, such as ligand-metal cations interactions, supramolecular interactions including host-guest interactions and hydrogen bonding, as well as covalent bonds. This review mainly focuses on the interactions between CDs and MOFs and the strategy of combining them together, diverse external stimuli responsiveness of CDs-modified/coated MOFs, as well as applications of these hybrid materials to drug delivery and release system, catalysis and detection materials. Additionally, due to the importance of investigating advanced chemical architectures and physiochemical properties of CDs-modified/coated MOFs, a separate section is involved in diverse characterization methods and instruments. Furthermore, this minireview also foresees future research directions in this rapidly developing field.",
