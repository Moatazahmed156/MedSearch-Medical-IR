    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the first epicentres of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, displaying pathology decades before clinical symptom onset. We investigated whether LC integrity was associated with cortical deposition of amyloid and tau in vivo in asymptomatic, at-risk older adults. 208 healthy older adults with first-degree familial history of Alzheimer's disease were included from the PREVENT-AD cohort (mean age 68.4 ± 5.14y, 69% female). 155 subjects were also examined longitudinally over 38.8 ± 14.0 months. Subjects underwent longitudinal 3T MRI: 1mm We observed negative associations between LC integrity and amyloid SUVR across almost all cortical regions (Figure 1). Associations between LC integrity and cortical tau were restricted to temporal lobes, including parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal regions (Figure 1). Associations with both amyloid and tau were particularly strong in the left hemisphere. These associations were observed only at baseline, with no longitudinal effects observed. The relationship between baseline LC integrity and cortical tau was modulated by global amyloid in lateral temporal cortices, particularly along in the left lateral temporal cortex (Figure 2). LC degeneration was associated with greater expression of key hallmarks of AD pathology in asymptomatic older adults. We support the model that LC is central to the earliest pathophysiological changes of AD.",
