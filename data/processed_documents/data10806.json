    "title": "Interesting Case of Mesocardia: A Rare Cardiac Positional Anomaly.",
    "abstract": "A 37-year-old man presenting with chronic cough was incidentally found to have mesocardia on chest imaging, with a midline heart and associated upper thoracic scoliosis. Further tests revealed eosinophilic asthma, treated successfully. This rare, isolated mesocardia case highlights the importance of recognising abnormal cardiac positioning on routine radiographs.",
