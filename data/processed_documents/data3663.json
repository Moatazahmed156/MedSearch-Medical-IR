    "abstract": "Fragile X-syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. The key clinical features of the fragile X-syndrome in males are mental retardation, a long face with large everted ears and large testes. The disorder is associated with a visible fragile site at Xq27.3 at FMR-1 loucs with the amplification of (CGC) n repeat sequence. The early diagnosis of affected individuals are carriers who are not aware of their high risk of having an affected child is important for proper management and counselling.",
