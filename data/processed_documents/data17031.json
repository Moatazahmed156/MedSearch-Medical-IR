    "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend broad sequencing as a first-tier test for epilepsy, identifying a genetic etiology in 40% of cases. Sequencing subsequently increases the number of patients identified with variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). Clinicians desire additional investigatory methods to better classify these VUSs. The  The number of epilepsy patients with nondiagnostic genetic results requires additional modes of investigation. Reclassification often takes years due to the novelty of variants identified. This case highlights the importance of laboratory scrutiny when multiple variants are detected, the need for greater data sharing between laboratories to reduce inconsistent classifications, and the utility of ancillary testing, such as methylation studies, to aid in VUS reclassification.",
