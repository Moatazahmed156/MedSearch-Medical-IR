    "abstract": "Wound healing, a physiological process, involves several different types of cells, from immune cells to non-immune cells, including mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC), and their interactions. Immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells (DC), innate lymphoid cells (ILC), natural killer (NK) cells, and B and T lymphocytes participate in wound healing by secreting various mediators and interacting with other cells. MSCs, as self-renewing, fast proliferating, and multipotent stromal/stem cells, are found in a wide variety of tissues and critically involved in different phases of wound healing by secreting various molecules that help to improve tissue healing and regeneration. In this review, first, we described the four main phases of wound healing, second, we reviewed the function of MSCs, MSC secretome and immune cells in improving the progress of wound repair (mainly focusing on skin wound healing), third, we explained the immune cells/MSCs interactions in the process of wound healing and regeneration, and finally, we introduce clinical applications of MSCs to improve the process of wound healing.",
