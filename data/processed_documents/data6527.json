    "abstract": "Wine quality is closely related to various compounds including polysaccharides, a class of crucial macromolecules that affect its chemical and physical properties by influencing the colloidal state or interacting with other compounds via non-covalent bonds. Herein, the composition and structural characteristics of the major polysaccharides identified in wine and the factors influencing their contents are briefly described. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of wine polysaccharides and their practical applications on wine stability and organoleptic qualities is thoroughly discussed. The effects of polysaccharides on wine quality are significantly correlated with their structure and composition as well as wine matrix composition. Thus, to better understand the chemical complexity of polysaccharides, relevant analytical methods are systematically summarized and highlighted, which may ultimately lead to the development of novel winery guidelines.",
