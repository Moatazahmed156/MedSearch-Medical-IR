    "title": "Pre-TIPS Diastolic Dysfunction as a Predictor of Post-TIPS Outcomes in Patients With Cirrhosis.",
    "abstract": "The clinical relevance of diastolic dysfunction (DD), as defined by the revised 2020 Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy (CCM) guidelines, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing TIPS remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association between 2020 CCM DD criteria and post-TIPS outcomes. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of adults who underwent TIPS between 2018 and 2022. Patients with recorded parameters to assess 2020 CCM DD (≥ 3 of: E/e' ≥ 15, septal e' velocity < 7 cm/s, tricuspid regurgitation velocity > 2.8 m/s, left atrial volume index > 34 mL/m Of 261 patients, 18 (6.9%) met the 2020 CCM DD criteria. These patients were older (67 vs. 59 years, p = 0.001) and had higher rates of hypertension (66% vs. 39%, p = 0.024) and MASLD (55% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.009). Although not associated with mortality, those meeting the 2020 CCM DD criteria had higher odds of developing cardiovascular events (adjusted OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.8-23.4, p = 0.004), renal dysfunction (adjusted OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2-10.6, p = 0.016), and liver dysfunction (adjusted OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.3-23.1, p < 0.001). 75.8% (n = 198) met the 2005 DD criteria and showed no association with outcomes. DD defined by the 2020 CCM criteria, but not the 2005 criteria, was associated with significantly higher odds of early post-TIPS complications. Patients meeting 2020 CCM DD criteria were associated with older age, hypertension, MASLD, and beta-blocker use, and may benefit from close post-TIPS monitoring.",
