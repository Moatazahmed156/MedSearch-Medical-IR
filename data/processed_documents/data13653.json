    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells demonstrate remarkable effectiveness in targeting and eliminating pathogenic B-cell lineages, showing significant specificity and efficacy against B cell malignancies. In addition, CAR-T cell-mediated B cell depletion and resetting, which showed great potential in treating autoimmune diseases, thereby extending the clinical applicability of adoptive cell therapy. In this review, we examine the progression of CAR-T targeted B cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, encompassing the development of new therapeutic strategies and reports on related clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the article delves into the challenges and potential avenues for enhancement related to the safety aspects and inherent limitations of current technological solutions.",
