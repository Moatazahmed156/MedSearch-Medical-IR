    "title": "Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes and calcium ion exchange: A novel direction for aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes serve as crucial signaling hubs mediating communication between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and play a central role in calcium ion exchange. This dynamic interface regulates key cellular processes including bioenergetic metabolism, apoptosis, autophagy, and stress responses. Dysregulation of calcium transport associated with mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes can disrupt intracellular homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, which are hallmarks of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This review systematically examines the functions of protein complexes within mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the pathogenic mechanisms of calcium signaling regulated by these membranes in neurodegenerative disorders. It places particular emphasis on structural alterations in calcium ion transport machinery as a common mechanism underlying various neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes exhibit a hyperactive state, promoting the generation of amyloid-β and enhancing calcium ion flux from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria. In contrast, in Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the activity of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes is reduced, leading to a decline in mitochondrial calcium ion buffering capacity and exacerbating excitotoxicity. Proteins residing in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes are disrupted across various neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in abnormal communication between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Recent studies indicate that mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes play a bidirectional role in disease progression, and compensatory mechanisms often exacerbate the pathological process. Therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes hold promise for alleviating neurodegenerative damage. Therefore, calcium ion exchange mediated by mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes plays a key role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a highly promising therapeutic target.",
