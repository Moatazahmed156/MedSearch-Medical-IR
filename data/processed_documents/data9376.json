    "abstract": "Glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes is crucial yet remains challenging. Hypoglycemia poses an increased risk of complications, prolonged stays, and mortality. Strategies such as basal-bolus-correction insulin can help balance glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemic events. This study evaluated the impact of a mandatory electronic medical record-based insulin order set across a multihospital system. This quality improvement project was implemented at 10 hospitals in North Carolina, including urban, rural, and community sites. The intervention introduced a standardized insulin order set with multiple fail-safes addressing insulin-to-nutrition mismatch, basal and bolus coverage, and dose accuracy. The primary outcome was hypoglycemia days per 1000 patient-days in nonpregnant adults. Secondary outcomes included hyperglycemia days and the rate of hemoglobin A1c orders. Hypoglycemia days across all sites decreased from 13 to 10 per 1000 patient-days (24% reduction,  Implementation of a mandatory, standardized insulin order set with multiple fail-safes across a multihospital system effectively reduced hypoglycemic events, thus demonstrating their value in managing inpatient diabetes.",
