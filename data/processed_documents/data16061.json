    "title": "Leveraging genomic conservation in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants for precision diagnostics, vaccines, and RNAi therapeutics.",
    "abstract": "The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants, challenging the efficacy of existing diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Despite this genomic variability, several regions of the viral genome remain highly conserved, offering stable targets for pan-variant intervention strategies. This study employed a multi-pronged approach integrating immunoinformatics, RNA interference (RNAi), and molecular diagnostics to design mutation-resilient tools against SARS-CoV-2. Conserved genomic regions-including NSP7-NSP16 (except NSP15), ORF6, E, M, N, untranslated regions (UTRs), and the S2 subunit of the spike protein-were identified through comparative genomic analysis of over 10 million sequences. Epitope prediction was performed using IEDB and NetMHCpan to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes with strong HLA binding and broad immunogenicity. siRNA sequences were designed using the Ui-Tei rule and siDirect 2.0, targeting conserved viral elements with minimized off-target effects. RT-qPCR primers were developed via Primer-BLAST, anchored to conserved loci to enhance diagnostic robustness. Selected epitopes demonstrated >99 % conservation and high immunogenicity, supporting their inclusion in a multi-epitope vaccine construct. Designed siRNAs exhibited strong theoretical binding affinity and low thermal stability, ensuring specificity and adaptability to emerging variants. Primers targeting conserved regions showed optimal RT-qPCR parameters and broad variant coverage, reducing the risk of false negatives. This integrative framework highlights the strategic value of conserved genomic regions for developing resilient diagnostics, vaccines, and RNAi-based therapeutics. The proposed tools offer broad-spectrum applicability across SARS-CoV-2 variants and lay the foundation for precision medicine approaches in pandemic response.",
