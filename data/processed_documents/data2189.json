    "abstract": "Once a primary SCI occurs, there is great potential for further deterioration in spinal cord function due to secondary injury processes. Deterioration in the function of the spinal cord needs to be detected in a timely manner so that interventions to limit the progression of injury can be initiated. Spinal cord function assessment should be thorough, systematic, easy to perform, and based on spinal cord structure and function. Because sensory and motor information is carried in different tracts, with locations in different parts of the spinal cord, it is important to individually assess and document the function of each major tract. A spinal cord surveillance tool was developed that incorporated motor and sensory parameters by cord segment level. The aim of developing and implementing the flowsheet was to improve the quality of nursing care given to SCI patients by providing nurses with a tool that (1) standardizes the assessment, (2) facilitates comparison of findings to previous assessments, and (3) improves communication of patient status data among health care team members.",
