    "abstract": "Sepsis causes high mortality among people living with HIV in Africa, yet immune response data are limited. We identified immune subphenotypes of adults with sepsis and a high prevalence of HIV in East Africa. We determined the association of serum cytokine and antibody concentrations with CD4+ T-cell and blood lactate concentration, tuberculosis, and 30-day mortality with K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and logistic regression. We validated results in a separate cohort of adults with sepsis in East Africa. Of 208 participants in the discovery cohort, 117 (56%) were female and 175 (84%) were living with HIV, with a mean (±SD) age of 35 (±10) years. Participants with tuberculosis had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1MCAF, whereas mortality was associated with higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP-1β, and lower concentrations of IgM antibodies against oxidation-specific epidopes (IgM  In adults with sepsis and high HIV prevalence in East Africa, tuberculosis was associated with pathogen-specific inflammation, and mortality was associated with broader immune dysregulation and diminished IgM ",
