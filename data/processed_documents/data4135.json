Hemorrhage within an adrenal myelolipoma is an uncommon occurrence, and when it happens, it can present with various clinical manifestations. Here, we report a case of a hemorrhagic giant adrenal myelolipoma in a 45-year-old female that was discovered incidentally. We discuss the clinical presentation, radiological findings, surgical intervention, and postoperative outcomes in this case report.",
